bookclub,"Hello! 

We have had an increase in posts that break the rules of /r/BookClub, so to nip that in the bud, I'd like to highlight which posts we encourage, as well as those that will be promptly deleted by the moderators. 

#If you post unacceptable posts, they will be deleted. If you repeat this behavior, or if you harass members/mods attempting to educate you, you will be banned.

Specifically **OKAY**:

* Threads about any past selected book are fine.

* Threads proposing discussion series about previously selected works are (usually get mod support) (see Evergreen rule).

* Threads about the current selection. 

* Meta threads -- about the direction of the sub - are fine.

* Advertisements for other bookish subreddits are okay, keep it to 3 times a year per subreddit. **This only applies to bookish *subreddits*; not websites, YouTube pages, discords, etc...**

 * Announcements of group reads or voting/nominating in other subs is also fine, but they will count under the 3x/year unless an arrangement is reached with the mods. 

* While you can't post links, it's okay to make a text post including a link to a thread in another sub where a substantive conversation about specific books is going on. That is, a conversation where talking about scenes and passages would fit in. Be sure to introduce your link by telling us which subreddit you are linking to and why r/bookclub should want to visit. 

Specifically **NOT** okay: 

* Posts regarding ""live"" book clubs. If you'd like to start a book club in your town, check out your local subreddit, library, or book store. 

* Requests for book suggestions. That is better for /r/suggestmeabook. /r/books also has weekly recurring threads that may also meet your specific book needs. 

* Promotions for your book (or your friend's, auntie's, etc...). If you would like to make a post promoting a future read, you can make a [Campaign] post. More on that below. 
 
* Off topic posts: If it doesn't relate to books, we do not want to see it here. 

**Types of Labeled Posts**: 

* [Meta] - Posts about /r/bookclub. How it is run, things you would like to see, etc. 

* [Scheduled] - These are posts that reference our current books, located in the sidebar. 

* [Evergreen] - These are posts from our [previous selections](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/wiki/previous), led by a community member. If you want to participate in an Evergreen read, suggest it to the club. If you want to run it, feel free to develop a schedule and let the mods know. We will usually throw all of our support behind these. 

* [Campaign] - This is how you pitch a book to the club in between votes. ***Provide a description, and why /r/BookClub should want to read the book.*** There are no strict rules around these books, except you may not profit from the selection of the book you are campaigning for. *This is subject to change.*

 * You can also add books to the [Accumulator](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/8cqihu/the_candidate_accumulator_13/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=bookclub&amp;utm_content=t3_8rg64h) to promote future reads. Occasionally we choose solely from what is available in the accumulator.

bookclub,"I quickly read the chapters outlined in the schedule tonight in preparation for the discussion thread on the 6th, but I also wanted to get a little talk going about the book beforehand since the mods said that was ok and it is currently fresh on my mind.

The first four chapters really leave the apocalypse open to speculation considering the only things that have happened so far are that the satellite, cell service, and electricity have gone out. I'm imagining plausible scenarios, but I keep forgetting the genre of the book is science fiction--so I don't quite know what to expect.

At first, I thought that maybe it was a solar storm, but the outages weren't as immediate as I imagined they would be. The genre keeps throwing me off and based on what I've read so far as well as the synopsis of the book, I have no idea what is going to happen--but I'd love to hear what you guys think.

What if they never say? It might not even be an important part of the overall narrative.

We don't have much to go on."
bookclub,"**Quick-ish Summary:** And so we reach the end.  The rest of the pieces in the puzzles come together as we meet Mike Evans, the son of an American oil tycoon as disgusted with humanity as Ye but with the bank account to do something about it.  They found the Earth-Trisolaris Organization.  ETO itself fragments into factions between Adventists who hate humanity, Redemptionists who built up a faith around Trisolaran society, and Survivors who just wanted to survive on the winning side.  Ye reveals that Trisolaris managed to ""lock"" humanity's scientific progress by shooting protons at Earth.  Now that's it own in the open, the worlds armed forces come together to stop Evans and get the information he kept from Ye.  Da Shi proposes they use Wang's nanomaterial to slice Evans's ship into the pieces as it crosses the Panama Canal.  Wang witnesses his creation become a weapon, but the plan is successful.  From Evans's reconstructed tapes, we learn that the Trisolarans developed ""sophons,"" or protons transformed into superintelligent computers.  These devices were able to listen in to Earth and to trick humans with what amounted to Scooby-Doo flickering lights and projected countdowns.  More importantly, the sophon was able to alter the results of physics experiments, thus sabotaging humanity's progress.  Trisolaris issues one last message, ""You're bugs!""  Ye may consider it sunset for humanity, but Wang and Da Shi find hope in Trisolaris's taunt and get back to work.

&amp;#x200B;

Kickstart questions for our last discussion:

* The book references a theory that First Contact as a rallying symbol is more important than the contact itself.  If it had been 1960s in the US, how might that symbol have changed?  What about today?
* Is Mike Evans a sympathetic figure?
* What do you think of the confrontation between Da Shi and Colonel Stanton?  And now that we've made it to the end - Da Shi - love him or hate him?
* What did you picture in your head when Liu describes unfolding the proton into eyes?  Was it alive?
* What do you think of Shi's locust fable?

&gt;""I just want to ask the two of you one question: Is the technological gap between humans and Trisolarans greater than the one between locusts and humans?""

* Given Liu's public political stances, what do you make of this quote from his post script in the American edition:

&gt;On Earth, humankind can step onto another continent, and without a thought, destroy the kindred civilizations found there through warfare and disease. But when they gaze up at the stars, they turn sentimental and believe that if extraterrestrial intelligences exist, they must be civilizations bound by universal, noble, moral constraints, as if cherishing and loving different forms of life are parts of a self-evident universal code of conduct.  
&gt;  
&gt;I think it should be precisely the opposite: Let's turn the kindness we show toward the stars to members of the human race on Earth and build up the trust and understanding between the different peoples and civilizations that make up humanity.  But for the universe outside the solar system, we should be ever vigilant, and be ready to attribute the worst of intentions to any Others that might exist in space.  For a fragile civilization like ours, this is without a doubt the most responsible path.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you enjoyed the book!  Join us next month for [Moon of the Crusted Snow](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/ehezox/moon_of_the_crusted_snow_schedule/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)!"
bookclub,"Our January selection is *Moon of the Crusted Snow* by Waubgeshig Rice.

Full disclosure, it didn't have the most votes. By the time I got to the post, *Where the Crawdads Sing* and *Circe* were tied for 22 votes each. But because the point of a discovery read is to read lesser-known titles, and the previous two are hugely popular, I bypassed them for the next highest-voted title. I apologize to anyone who feels that I should have chosen one of these. If you would like to lead one, please message me and we'll make it happen.

When I was looking at everything on Goodreads, I noticed that they list the number of ratings each book has; that might help us gauge popularity in the future, rather than me posting a dozen rules meant to filter out popular titles and not quite succeeding.

A schedule for *Moon of the Crusted Snow* will go up by the end of the weekend. It looks great and I hope you join us."

# YE WENJIE!

Game's over and it seems the end is beginning.  Wang uncovers a schism in the Frontiers of Science organization and that the commander is none other than Ye Wenjie.  We learn the rest of Ye Wenjie's story - how she made contact with Trisolaris, how she murdered the Comissaar and her husband Yang, the birth of her daughter and the time spent in the village, returning to the world and meeting her mother and the Red Guard who had killed her father.  

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have many quick start questions this time.  What do you think of Ye Wenjie's story so far?"
bookclub,"**Quick-ish Summary:** Ye Wenjie wraps up her Red Coast story and tells Wang Miao she tends to believe that Humans are alone in the universe.  Wang goes back to 3Body as Copernicus and finds himself in a more European setting of the game. Wang/Copernicus declares his revolutionary theory: There are three suns and the world is tossed between them like a football.  The assembled players scoff at him and try to burn him at the stake, only to find he's right and the games moves on to the second level.  At the same time as this discovery, Wei Cheng reports to Da Shi that his life has been threatened.  Wei Cheng tells the story of how he met Shen Yufei and their odd marriage for the convenience of his research into the mathematical three body problem.  Now that Wei Cheng has had a breakthrough, his life has been threatened by both an anonymous caller if he continues and his wife if he stops.  Too late for Da Shi and his crew though, Shen Yufei is murdered.  Wei remembers a strange confrontation with Pan Han, a reference to a ""commander"" and sides like Adventist and Redemptionist.  Wang Maio returns to 3Body to find the players have made a human computer to predict the sun rise.  Successful or not, they are destroyed by a phenomenon of the three body system - a syzygy that diminishes gravity and causes the atmosphere to escape the planet.  As terrible an end as it may be, it leads to an important milestone as Wang is invited to a meet-up of 3Body players.  At the meet-up, Pan Han reveals the world of Trisolaris is very real and that he is looking for like-minded people who want Trisolarans and their society to come to Earth. Pan Han welcomes his new recruits as comrades.  Wang's next trip into 3Body finds that the Trisolarans deemed the three body problem unsolvable and that now they will look for a new home.  Wang logs in again to find the Trisolarans leaving, all their hope placed in the expedition fleet.  The game is over.  Time for another meet-up.

&amp;#x200B;

What would you add if you had to summarize the reading?

Some discussion questions to kickstart conversation:

* How alike or different are Wang and the real Copernicus?  Why did the game setting switch to Europe?
* What would the flag of Trisolaris look like?
* Are Shen Yufei and Pan Han human?
* Why does Pan Han use so loaded a term as ""comrade""?
* What do you think of this quote:

&gt;Even if God were here, it wouldn't do any good.  The entire human race has reached the point where no one is listening to their prayers.

* What were some words/phrases/quotes that stood out to you?

Please mark spoilers if you want to discuss something past the reading. Hope you're enjoying the book!"
bookclub,"Hello! Will anyone be up for reading The Brothers Karamazov? Like, a reading buddy. Let me know if that interests you. I mostly want to read Classics this year."
bookclub,"It's time for another Discovery Read! For January, we’re looking specifically for authors who aren’t particularly well-known. We’re brand new at this, and our first attempts at it are going to be kind of clumsy, because you just know that we missed some obvious well-known author in our list below, or else we added too many and no one can think of anyone to nominate. We’re defining “obscure” as:

1. Not an author in the below list 
2. But on par with the authors below, so no Stephen Kings, J. K. Rowlings or Neil Gaimans 
3. Not generally well-known; I left C. S. Lewis and Don DeLillo out on purpose just so I could point out that they're not good choices either for this exact reason 
4. Not something we’ve done before 
5. Has not had a movie made about it, or at least not in English 
6. Hasn’t won a Nobel or a Pulitzer or a Man Booker 
7. Isn’t something the average person would read in high school 
8. Fiction
9. Not published in the last year
10. Available as an ebook and not outrageously expensive (we learned this lesson back in September)

We won’t call you out if your book breaks the rules, we’ll just quietly skip it. No risk. If you need inspiration, check out awards shortlists for years past and see what you like.

bookclub,"Sorry for the delay! When I made the schedule, I forgot today was concert day for me haha.

**Quick Summary:** Wang Miao plays 3Body for the first time and meets some figures (players?) from China's historic and mythological past.  We get the first rules of the world of Three Body that time is divided into Stable Eras and Chaotic Eras, but with no means to predict them other than the three Flying Stars.  The penalty for your prediction being wrong though is death.  Wang visits Yang Dong's mother who, \*gasp\*, is Ye Wenjie! She's back and connects Wang with a student who can help him with Shen Yufei's flickering universe.  Much to Dr. Sha's dismay, Shen proves right - At the time she predicted, cosmic background radiation began to fluctuate in a morse pattern reflecting a countdown.  When Wang put on the 3k glasses, the sky actually did flicker in time with the morse pattern.  Da Shi manages to talk Wang down and together they begin to piece together some sort of conspiracy - one that Da Shi is convinced is tied in some way to the 3Body game.  Wang spends more time with Ye, who tells him more about her time at Red Coast.  Ye did stay on at the military base and became more and more involved in its workings.  From the declassified documents, it seems Red Coast was indeed trying to make first contact.

What would you add if you had to summarize the reading?

Some discussion questions to kickstart conversation:

* Why did Commissar Lei lie to Ye Wenjie about Red Coast's purpose?  Was Yang protesting involving Ye even more into Red Coast's workings, or was he protesting the lie?
* So far, the characters who have tried to establish how to predict a Stable Era and how Three Body's sun works have died pretty horrific deaths as a result, but each seemed so sure that they were right.  Is faith and philosophy playing a role in their choices?
* Do you have ideas on how to predict a Stable Era?  What information might be hidden in the game that could give you more clues? 
* What do you think of this quote:

&gt;In his current state, his mental stability depended on two pillars: this old woman, who had weathered so many storms and become as gentle as water, and Shi Qiang, the man who feared nothing because he knew nothing.

* What were some words/phrases/quotes that stood out to you?

Please mark spoilers if you want to discuss something past the reading. Hope you're enjoying the book!  Next week I'll be able to post earlier :)"
bookclub,"**Quick-ish Summary:** Time skip! We meet Wang Miao who is recruited by loose-canon Holmesian cop, Da Shi, to assist with uncovering a conspiracy. Wang is taken to a military compound staffed with not only Chinese police and military, but also NATO and CIA officers - it seems the world is watching. Apparently, elite scientists are committing suicide and there is a murky connection to a research group, Frontiers of Science. One victim stands out in particular to Wang - Yang Dong - who left a note claiming that physics wasn’t real. Ding Yi, Yang’s boyfriend, explains to Wang that particle accelerator tests with their inconsistent, wild results really do seem to point to everything being wrong and maybe the laws of physics we all know don't even exist. But now that Wang has accepted this assignment, terrifying things are starting to happen - a countdown has appeared on only his photos and now before his very eyes. Wang goes to see Shen Yufei from the Frontiers of Science. After she finished her game of 3body and he tells his story, she advises Wang to stop his nanomaterials research. Oddly enough, it works. She clearly knows something, especially after Wang overhears a confrontation with environmentalist Pan Han who delivers a warning (or a threat) against whatever research it is she and her husband are doing. Shen tells Wang how to see the countdown on a grander scale and that “the entire universe will flicker for you” when his nanomaterials work picks back up in 3 days.

&amp;#x200B;

Some discussion questions to kickstart conversation: 

* About 30 or 40 years have passed since we left Ye Wenjie at Red Coast.  Do you think she's still there?
* In the first reading, Ye Zhetai (Ye Wenjie's father) had some thoughts about how his wife had tried to conform her teaching to revolutionary attitudes and challenges his accusers that ""philosophy falling from the sky"" can't guide scientific experiments, science is born from experience.  How does that stand up against what Yang Dong uncovered and what Ding Yi/Wang Miao are experiencing now in the story?  
* How do you feel about the Shooter/Farmer hypothesis?
* Da Shi - love him or hate him? :D
* What were some words/phrases/quotes that stood out to you?
* If you are the marginalia type, what are some of your margin notes?

bookclub,"**Quick Summary:** Ye Wenjie witnesses her mother and father's struggle session - admittedly it's her father on stage, but her mother has to make a terrible choice and finds herself one of his accusers.  Her father dead, her mother broken, we catch back up with Ye in the lumber camp where she's been given a second chance.  Bai Mulin gives her a copy of Silent Spring, but betrays her and uses her passion to send an incriminating letter to the government to stop the environmental nightmare they're creating.  Alone in a cell, Ye is offered a chance for leniency in exchange for speaking against her father.  She declines.  Left to die in the cold, Ye finds herself on a helicopter headed to Red Coast.  Despite the Cultural Revolution, China needs scientists with her skillset it seems.  Ye accepts an offer to stay forever and we are given a preview of whatever it is Red Coast is doing.

Some discussion questions to kick us off - remember, post whatever you would like to discuss, this is just to help kickstart the conversation.
- The narrative gives us an impression that Ye Wenjie will be important through its treatment of Bai Mulin.  What do you predict Ye will go on to do?
- What do you think of Ye's growing philosophy on humanity?
- What would you do if you were in any of the Ye family's shoes during the struggle session?

bookclub,Here's a discussion post for chapters 8-10 of Things Fall Apart. What are your thoughts?
bookclub,Here's a discussion post for chapters 4-7 of Things Fall Apart. What are your thoughts?
bookclub,"This discussion covers chapters 1-3 of Things Fall Apart.

I haven’t read yet, I spent the day asleep and hurting. The little bastard comes out on Friday and I will be more present for discussions this weekend! I also intend to come back in and comment later, when I’ve gotten the section read.

What did you think? Any symbols? What do you think of the main character? How does his life seem right now? How is the prose different from Toni Morrison’s, if you read Beloved with us last month?"
bookclub,"Do you love it? Do you hate it? Why?

(A question to those familiar with the book: how important is it that I always go where directed in the footnotes? A few times a footnote will have me jumping to chapters hundreds of pages forward (like 'See Tom's Story') which seem like huge spoilers to me.)"
bookclub,How about a Hugo or Nebula award winner for December?
bookclub,"I'm sorry I'm behind, you guys. My gallbladder has had enough of me, and it's making that extremely clear, lol. Surgery is scheduled for the 8th unless it realizes it can speed up the process by getting infected. (Shh.) I'll try really hard to participate in all the discussions but there may be a post or two where that doesn't happen.


Anyway, here's the Things Fall Apart schedule. I've made it slightly bottom-heavy so we read sections 2 and 3 in chunks, but it's still fewer pages than we did for Beloved.

* 11/6 - Chapters 1-3
* 11/11 - 4-7
* 11/16 - 8-10
* 11/21 - 11-13
* 11/26 - 14-19
* 11/30 - 20-25"
bookclub,"Hey everyone!

So what did you think of the ending? Of the book as a whole?

I loved that it maintained the familiars perspective, everything we learned coming from them. I adored that Sherlock was a werewolf! I've never seen anything in his stories indicating that, so it was cool. Seriously, this book was so fun for me! 

Tell me your thoughts! Especially if it have any about the switch at the end."
bookclub,"Hi all! This is our final discussion post. I have not read the section yet, but wanted to put this up now instead of several hours from now because I know some of you are itching to discuss.

Talk to me! What did you think?"
bookclub,"Hey! I'm home and finally have time to post. 

So we finally have an explanation of the game! What do you think? How did you like this section?"
bookclub,"This covers the section from “One more curve in the road...” to III (“124 was quiet.”)

Some stream of consciousness here! Anyone reminded of The Sound and the Fury? I had a rough time with Beloved’s section, so I’m curious about what you guys think of it.

Anything else you want to talk about?"
bookclub,"The winner for November's indigenous authors read is Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe.

Would anyone like to read run?"
bookclub,"This covers the section from “She was crawling already...” to “One more curve in the road...”.

What did you think? Any more pieces coming together?

My comments tomorrow."
bookclub,"Continuing our themes, for November and American Thanksgiving we are doing a novel by an indigenous author.

For this read, we are looking for a novel (fiction) by a member of an indigenous group that was or is under European occupation. Examples include the obvious, such as native Americans and Canadians, but also Australian aborigines, Polynesians, Brazilians, Mayans, Algerians, Congolese, etc. Short stories and poems don't count. Plays are fine.

Please also ensure that your nomination is around or under 500 pages, and that we [haven't done it before](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/wiki/previous). Nominations should also be easy to find and available as ebooks.

HAPPY VOTING!

Since I'm late getting this up, we will have a shorter voting period of five days. Voting will close around the end of the day PDT on 10/25, and the winner will be announced shortly thereafter."
bookclub,"Hi, all. This covers the fifth section of Beloved, from “In the back of Baby Suggs’ mind...” to “She was crawling already....”

So. We find out, now, what happened to Beloved.

What did you think of this section? Anything you want to discuss?"
bookclub,"\[**NOTE:** This is being posted with the express approval and permission of the r/bookclub mod team.\]

Greetings, r/BookClub. I just wanted to announce that r/ThomasPynchon will be conducting a group read of Thomas Pynchon's second novel, *The Crying of Lot 49* starting next month, on 22 November 2019, for 8 weeks. Tentatively, the schedule will be as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

|Dates|Chapters|Discussion Leader|
|:-|:-|:-|
|22 November 2019|Reading Commences|\-|
|29 November 2019|Chapter One|u/FrenesiGates|
|6 December 2019|Chapter Two|u/grigoritheoctopus|
|13 December 2019|Chapter Three|u/fearandloath8|
|20 December 2019|Chapter Four|u/BudgetHero|
|27 December 2019|Chapter Five|u/BookishPianosaur|
|3 January 2020|Chapter Six|u/TheChumOfChance|
|10 January 2020|Capstone|Everyone|

This past summer, we finished up a [group read](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThomasPynchon/wiki/readinggroups/v) of Thomas Pynchon's *V.* that went rather well. If you're interested, join us over at the sub, and keep an eye out for the start of the book. This is a wonderful opportunity for readers who haven't explored Pynchon and veteran Pynchonians who'd like to revisit his earlier works (or perhaps people who've tried to read his work in the past and not been able to complete it). 

Based on how terrifically the *V.* group went, we will likely be coordinating these group reads every winter and summer, making our way chronologically through his published works. *Gravity's Rainbow* is projected to be scheduled for Summer of '20, so if you've been looking to read it, but may have been too discouraged by its length or complexity, that will also be a good opportunity to jump in.

I'm usually very uncomfortable with blameless self-promotion, but this felt like a good place to find some folks who might be genuinely interested in a project like this.

Thanks for listening!

\-Bloom"
bookclub,"Hey, 

So what do you think so far? All these familiars preparing for this event... It is very interesting you watch. Tell me what you think and interact with one another! 😁"
bookclub,"This covers the section from “Out of sight of Mister’s sight...” to “In the back of Baby Suggs’ mind...”

So! We’ve hit the halfway point and things are getting... odd. Odder, anyway. My comments below (and I also eventually added comments to the last post two days late). What did you think? Anything you want to talk about?"
bookclub,"Hey guys. Sorry this is late, getting ready for this vacation and Thanksgiving is a bit overwhelming. 

Just tell me what you think. Anything goes. I'll respond when I can m 😉"
bookclub,"Heyo. My comments likely won't make it here until tomorrow, I'm beat.

This covers the section from ""Upstairs Beloved was dancing"" to ""Out of sight of Mister's sight"". What did you think? What did you not quite understand? Any parts you liked or didn't, any insights you want to share?"
bookclub,"This covers the section from “Pleasantly troubled, Sethe...” to “Upstairs, Beloved was dancing.”

What did you think? Anything interesting you picked up on?"
bookclub,"This covers the section from the start of the book to “Pleasantly troubled, Sethe...”

Daaaaamn, you guys, I remembered this being a good book, but I think I forgot how good it actually was. And I’m surprised at how much is revealed early on, and how little is subtext. We learn right away that the house, 124, contains the ghost of a baby who has died violently, and this situation is central to the story.

My observations in the comments. I really want to hear what you guys think!"
bookclub,Hey guys! What do you think so far? Initial impressions? Do you think it's scary? Confusing? Anything! 😁
bookclub,"Hey, guys. The version I'm using of this book doesn't really have chapters, but dates. As such, I'm going to make the schedule using pages with the dates as rough stopping points.

The dates in the book will not coincide with the dates on the schedule! So, IB will be my abbreviation for ""in book"", in reference to dates.

My version has 192 pages, which gives us about 6.5 pages per day. 

#Schedule:

October 4: Through October 14 IB

October 11: October 15 IB - October 21 IB

October 17: October 22 IB - October October 23 IB

October 24: October 24 IB - October 29 IB

October 30: Final

I really hope this makes sense. 

I am going on vacation in the middle of October, so if anyone wants to help with the discussions on the 17th and 24th, it will be greatly appreciated!"
bookclub,This book was beautiful and heart breaking and I loved it. I want to hear from you. What were your favorite it least favorite parts? Specific quotes? Anything from the whole book is up for grabs here.
bookclub,"Buckle up, we’re going on another slavery journey! If you liked *I, Tituba*, you’ll probably like *Beloved*. I would go so far as to call it one of the best books ever written, about a horrific moral choice made by a lot of women in slavery. I also want to draw some parallels to *Tituba*.

Here’s the schedule. There’s a weird stopping/starting point kind of in the middle of a chapter, but there are no chapter numbers or titles, and the first sentence of the next chapter is (I think, it’s been several years) a major spoiler.

* 10/6 - Beginning to “Pleasantly troubled, Sethe...”
* 10/9 - “Pleasantly troubled, Sethe...” to “Upstairs Beloved was dancing” 
* 10/13 - “Upstairs Beloved was dancing” to “Out of sight of Mister’s sight...”
* 10/16 - “Out of sight of Mister’s sight...” to “In the back of Baby Suggs’ mind...”
* 10/20 - “In the back of Baby Suggs’ mind...” to “She was crawling already...”
* 10/23 - “She was crawling already...” to “One more curve in the road...” (This is in the middle of a chapter, at the start of a section)
* 10/27 - “One more curve in the road...” to III (“124 was quiet.”)
* 10/30 - “124 was quiet” to end

Happy reading! I’ll see you here on the 6th."
bookclub,"Hey guys. I am in the hospital with gallbladder issues and on enough pain meds to have chosen a favorite opiate, so I am posting our discussion today rather than tomorrow. If I get some reading done I'll make some comments, but if not, you're on your own.

PS no well wishes unless accompanied by an observation on the book! ;)"
bookclub,Welcome! Our book for October is [A Night in the Lonesome October](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Night_in_the_Lonesome_October) By [Roger Zelazny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Zelazny)! Schedule will be posted in a few days. 😁
bookclub,Thoughts? Feelings? Academic dissertations? I'll post mine in the morning.
bookclub,"I noticed we didn't have a post up on the 23rd, so here it is! As with Graveyard Clay, I'm playing catch-up again. What do you want to talk about here? What struck you?"
bookclub,"I won't be able to read for another day, but please discuss! What did you enjoy? What did you hate? Are you seeing any overarching themes you want to talk about? Do you find the characters true to life? Talk to me!"
bookclub,"Somehow we haven't done Beloved before, and I am SO excited to read it with you guys. Would anyone like to assist in the read run?

Schedule will be up closer to 10/1. See you then!"
bookclub,"Happy Sunday! We’re about 3/4 of the way through the book, and I’m wondering what sort of patterns you’ve noticed emerging. Certainly Caitriona’s comedic hatefulness; we know she’s mystified about why she’s not better liked. We also see her grave being periodically dug up, but the same mistake isn’t being made every time, as multiple people have entered the graveyard without her knowing.

Are you still enjoying the book? It’s nothing but dialog, and its plot is sparse—but are you getting caught up in the petty drama? Do you love it? Are you ambivalent? (I assume those who outright hate it have moved on.) What do you think was Ó Cadhain’s purpose in writing it?"
bookclub,"I'm sorry, everyone, today destroyed me. I will have insightful comments tomorrow, but in the meantime, here's a discussion post. What do you think? What did you like? What did you dislike? Any thoughts, deep or otherwise?"
bookclub,"Continuing our themes, in addition to horror we are also doing a Nobel read in October. While the official ceremony is in December, the big excitement happens when winners are announced next month. The Nobel Prize in Literature is given to an author who has produced an outstanding, ""ideal"" or ""idealistic"" body of work.

For this read, we are looking for a novel (fiction) by a [Nobel laureate in literature](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Literature). Short stories and poems don't count. Plays are fine.

Please also ensure that your nomination is around or under 500 pages, and that we [haven't done it before](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/wiki/previous). Nominations should also be easy to find and available as ebooks, which is a lesson we learned doing September's Discovery Read.

I realize the list is full of old white guys. We are planning some more reads by writers who aren't old white guys in the future, but I encourage you to look carefully through the list of prize winners to see if any books by non-white people stand out to you.

 HAPPY VOTING!"
bookclub,"Apologies for the lateness of this post! Please note that today’s section is 6.5-7.5 — the last section posted about was 5.1–6.4, though it says 3.5-4.6.

Anyway, you’ve gotten a bit spoiled—I’m not nearly as thorough as /u/oryx85. My observations will be in comments instead of in the text of the post!

What did you think of this section? Was it difficult to follow, or easy? Do you feel the story is getting repetitive at this point, or are we still discovering new things about the characters? Are any of the characters actually growing?"
bookclub,"Wow, a lot happened here, and my heart is aching. But I want to know what you think. What themes did you notice? Any particular sentences or prose that was set apart for you? How do you view the trial or deposition?"
bookclub,"Edit: I messed up the title - this is for section 5.1 - 6.4 (or anything before that). 

The Trump of the Graveyard announces two new corpses (in separate interludes). Caitriona, as usual, hopes it is her son's wife, but it isn't. After hearing that Nora Sheainin's daughter had a fight with Big Brian's Mag, and Nell, Caitriona changes her opinion of Nora Sheainin's daughter completely! She learns that the plans for her cross have been abandoned. As usual, Caitriona is not interested in anything that concerns the new corpses, just in hearing news relevant to her.        

There's an interesting wordplay highlighted in the footnotes of the GC translation. I'd be interested to see how it's presented in the DD translation. In 5.3, they are discussing a garbled and a parodic version of folklore about Oliver Cromwell. In the text: 'he pushed Michael back as far as Shellig Michael'. 
The footnote:*what looks like a typing error is in fact a play on words. Seilg (Shellig) means 'persuit', and Seilg Mhichil (Shellig Michael) means Persuit of Michael. As St. Michael is being perused by the Devil between Conamara and the Aran Islands the author invents his own island, Seilg Mhichil (Shellig Michael), which looks like and sounds like the real Skellig Michael (Sceilg Mhichil) off the Kerry Coast, famous for its ancient monastic settlement of beehive huts. Sceilg means a steep rock.         

Have you noticed any other wordplay? Any sections that stood out to you? Anything you want to discuss or ask questions about? We are now half way through. Any predictions (no spoilers!) about the rest of the book?"
bookclub,So! What do you think?
bookclub,"Hey, all. I made a mistake and am forced to correct it. I miscounted the chapters in the book, not realizing there were 2 parts. As a result, we are nearly finished with Part I. I have created an alternate schedule that will allow us to finish on time. 

#You do not need to follow along with the schedule! 

* Remember, you can read at your pace and post when you want to. The schedule is to let you know when the read runners will be posting a discussion post about the relevant chapters, but you can always participate on your schedule by: 
 * Creating your own threads; 
 * Creating new, top-level comments on existing discussion threads;
 * Commenting on another person's top-level comment or discussion thread; 

So, here is the new schedule. 

September 14: Finish Part I (Through Part I: Chapter 12). 

September 17: Part II: Chapters 1-3

September 19: Part II: Chapters 4-7

September 23: Part II: Chapters 8-11

September 26: Part II: Chapters 12-13

September 30: Part II: Chapters 14-15 + Epilogue

While the initial burst right here at the beginning is adding an addition 15 pages a day, after that we are slowing down to a pace of about 15 pages per check-in. As I said, it is okay to take your time and post on your schedule. 

I'm really sorry for the confusion. If you have any questions or comments, post them here."
bookclub,"In this section:   
Several blame Siuan for their deaths, and acuse Peadar the pub of dishonest practices and theft. Peader retaliates by telling everyone that Nora, his political opponent was a drunkard. I enjoyed this quote from Nora: 'an election isn't half as cultural as I expected'. Neither Peader nor Nora win the election and they are reconciled afterwards.      

We hear from the Trump of the Graveyard again - what do you think of these sections? It's quite different from the rest of the book.     

There is another new corpse - Brid Terry - who gives news to Caitriona about her family and the community - Nora Sheainin's daughter has had a baby, and not died as Caitriona expected (hoped?!). Nell's son has also recovered. Caitriona believes Nell has asked the priest to perform what is effectively black magic, to bring her family good fortune. The Master's wife has remarried and Brid tells him that his wife said he told her to remarry after his death.

*Sean Pein in the original; a comic mishearing for champagne     

What would you like to discuss? What do you like/not like about the book so far? Anything you are struggling with, or struggling to follow? Do you have any questions? Any particular passages or quotes you enjoyed?"
bookclub,"This book is just beautifully done, don't you think? 

Really, what do you think? How are you finding it? Any favorite quotes? What themes are you noticing? 

I'll respond in the comments to these questions and we can go from there. :)"
bookclub,"Honestly idk what it is about this book but something has pulled me in immediately.   
Im 60 pages in right now and wish i had more time to read this book. Its got such real vivid characterization without a whole lot of excess detail. Its a beautiful with the writing style of this book. 
Who’s your favorite characters and why?
What significance have u reaped from the books(intro only please no spoilers)?
  
   
I just wanted to see if anyone would discuss the book with me in a pm convo?"
bookclub,"This section starts with Caitriona bickering with Nora. There's more general chatter - personal grudges etc, current affairs - talk of Hitler. Caitriona notes that when people in the world above talk about the dead having peace, it's a load of rubbish! It's very noisy in the graveyard! They have little else to do other than talk. It must be frustrating not knowing what is going on above ground, hence the excitement when someone newly dead arrives. Caitriona is curious about what kind of funeral she had, but comments that she'll have to wait for the next corpse that she was acquainted with! When Seainin Liam arrives, she is not satisfied with what she hears - Nell has been interfering with Caitriona's funeral.     

They are having their own election, with candidates from each plot aligning with the social classes. Nora is standing for the Fifteen-Shilling Party, which causes Caitriona to say 'I'll explode!'!      

It's interesting to note that one's social status can actually be improved after death - in 2.4, Caitriona talks about the cross Nora keeps reminding her she has on her grave, and how crosses and railings around a grave are equal to a big slated house with a name above the door, and the big walls around the Earl's house.           

What do you think of the character Caitriona? What about her feud with her sister Nell? Do you think we will find out more about why Caitriona hates Nell so much?       

The translation 'Graveyard Clay' has several footnotes (at least, my edition does). I've come to understand that 'The Dirty Dust' doesn't. I think the footnotes are useful and add to the experience - see the discussion about the French/Irish word play in the previous scheduled post. I'm going to add a few of the more interesting notes from this section here, in the format 'quote', *footnote.        

2.3     
'Pearse said, O'Donovan Rossa said, Wolfe Tone said it was Eamon de Valera was right...'       
*the listed political and historical figures are here all regarded as heroes of the age-long struggle for Irish independence.         

'I do have a fondness for the Old IRA'     
*The Irish Republican Army of the War of Independence and the Civil War, as opposed to the IRA of the more recent 'Troubles'.         

3.1    
'The Trump of the Graveyard'     
*poetic or archaic word for trumpet.        

3.3    
'""oh the black guard"" says Fionn....'     
*Fionn Mac Cumhaill (Finn Mac Cool) was the mythical leader of a band of warriors, the Fianna; Niamh and Grainne figure in legends about the Fianna.     

As always, feel free to discuss any aspects of the book so far, marking any spoilers of you've read ahead."
bookclub,"Well, after all the eye rolling after chapter 37, what do you think of the end?

The most noticeable plot thing is the swerve back to St John, 
fulfilling his calling without complaint.

Rochester regaining partial sight -- I think Bronte's aim in that
is that it makes him less pathetic, he gets to participate in being
a ""whole"" human being.


To me, not having anything about Bessie or Mrs. Fairfax seems to
not fit the ""all the loose ends tidied"" up tone."
bookclub,"Let’s discuss *I, Tituba*, Chapters 1-2. Quick summary:

Tituba’s teenage mother is raped on board a slave ship to Barbados. When she starts to show, her owner banishes her from the house to the fields, and gives her to a slave who loves her and raises Tituba as his own. When Tituba is seven, her owner notices her mother, and her mother defends herself against the second rape. Her mother is executed, her father sold, and Tituba is run off the plantation.

An old mystic woman takes her in and teaches her the tools of the trade. She dies when Tituba is 14. Tituba lives alone in the marsh until she meets John Indian, a slave who is apparently content with his life. Despite the counsel of her mother’s and the mystic’s ghosts, she works some magic and goes off to the city to be with him.

What did you like about this section? Is there anything you noticed that you want to bring up? I assume we all know what’s going to happen to Tituba later in life; how do you feel about watching her inch toward it?"
bookclub,"Welcome to the first scheduled post for Graveyard Clay, also translated from the original Irish, Cre Na Cille (please forgive my lack of accents on the Irish throughout this post, I'm on mobile) as The Dirty Dust. It's written almost entirely as dialogue - what do you think of that? Do you like it so far? I'm finding it to be funny!      

At the start, we meet Caitriona Phaidin, who has apparently already died and been buried, and is worrying about the plot they buried her in and other details of the funeral! As the section goes on, we start to learn about the people in Caitriona's life (and death!) and all the arguments and grudges, that continue after death.      

The translations - it seems the two translations are quite different. Graveyard Clay is apparently more faithful to the original, where The Dirty Dust is freer and focuses on the feeling and meaning of the original. It'll be interesting to compare as we go along. I'm reading Graveyard Clay.       

How are you finding the language, and the Irish names? I'm going to ATTEMPT to give a pronunciation guide to some of the names that came up in the first 20 or so pages - these characters are not necessarily major characters, it's just to give a flavour of the Irish. I'm not an Irish speaker, so please take this with a pinch of salt, and correct me if you know better!              

*Padraig - paw-drig    
*Tadhg - Tyg (like tiger without the r)   
*Eamonn - aim-an    
*Stiofan - shtee-fan    
*Caitriona - ca-treena or ca-tree-uh-na

bookclub,"Hey guys, 

Alright, we are going to use this final post to discuss what you DID like about the book, what you learned (if anything) through reading, and what symbols/themes caught your eye. 

I know a lot of people complained about not liking the book. They said there was little to no plot and that it seemed like everyone was just drinking and not caring about anything. This is actually one of the major themes of the book. Hemingway was examining the ""Lost Generation"" after WWI. The war left people broken. Knowing this, does it change your opinion of the book at all? 

The bullfights are symbolic of many things, but consider them as a symbol for the masculinity portrayed in the book. The weak are murdered, either by the strong or in the ring by other men. There are castrated bulls that must calm the others (think Jake with his impotence). What do you think of this connection? What other symbols stuck out to you during the book? 

Brett and Romero end their relationship after Brett finds she is ""in trouble,"" and sends him away, calling Jake to help her once again. She claims she sent him away for his own good, but it also seems she is desperate to keep what freedom she has. What do you think about this situation? 

Did anything else stick out to you? How did you feel about Cohn losing control? Did the racism in the book bother you? Any thoughts at all are welcome!"
bookclub,"*Graveyard Clay* is divided into 10 ""interludes"", which are subdivided into smaller chapters. To make it easy to reference, we're going to refer to them in an Interlude.Chapter format. The main discussion posts will go up on the following dates:

bookclub,"Because *I, Tituba* is proving difficult and expensive for some people to find, we are also running a second read, *Graveyard Clay* by Máirtín Ó Cadhain, which was the runner-up in this month’s voting. I was easily able to find it on both Kindle and Google Play. It was originally written in Irish and there seem to be two translations, one translated as *Graveyard Clay* and the other as *The Dirty Dust*. I don’t know if it matters which one you choose; it hasn’t for the Russian literature we’ve done.

I’ll have a schedule up within a day or two, but please assume we’ll start a few days to a week into September; that should give you time to locate and acquire the book."
bookclub,"Hi,

New to the bookclub but I'd like to recommend authors outside North American and Britain for the next bookclub selection.  While the Discovery Reads is a great idea reading and knowing the world outside of those perspectives would be great. Hope there will be more nominations and selections that reflect our diverse world."
bookclub,"We're getting to the end of 2010 Big Read . . .  

Summary: In previous weeks, Jane split her windfall of 20,000 pounds
among her nephew and nieces, and began preparing for . . . what? A
life of social and intellectual engagement, it doesn't seem much
clearer.  She makes the Moor House tidy and spruce.

She still cares for and tries to get information about Rochester.

St. John tries to recruit her to come to India with him; she agrees
to come as an aide, or ""curate"", but not to marry him.

What are your thoughts on ch 34 and 35?  Favorite lines?

Next week: Ch 36 and 37, and the week after that is the last chapter."

bookclub,"*No spoilers*

I decided to finish the rest of Fiesta: The Sun Also Rises last night. It seems that the reading is going to die which is strange for such a short book.

I noticed that a lot of people have been saying that the book is boring and that nothing is happening which I have to agree with in some ways but disagree in others. 

Yes, it seems that the book seems to just be a retelling of a trip that some guy took to Spain with his buddies and there are some tensions between the people going. But, isn't there something interesting about trying to put yourself in Jakes shoes and be amongst that while trying to remain as unattached and as seemingly uninvolved as he is. Yes it is mundane but so is real life and therefore this seems to be a book about how this character deals with real life in his class group, this country and this time period. The detachment I stated is a common theme in stories of the Lost Generation which seem to portray their characters in a self centred way. This book also somewhat reminds me of the book, American psycho. It has a similar feel of a first person narrative, a detached protagonist, seemingly uninteresting characters and a mundane story (for the most part.) However, I find that book the most interesting when I try to read a little into the boring characters and the little things they say. Sometimes I like to imagine what the story would be like if it were written from another characters perspective. What would our story be like if it were written from Brett's perspective? Or Robert Cohen? Maybe everyone is a little too involved in their own heads. Maybe everybody keeps a small piece of themselves reserved even in front of their closest friends. Maybe that's just people in a social class that encourages constant drinking out and socialising with people you don't particularly like. 

I do agree that the book isn't so very riveting, I probably won't read it again. Maybe I'm reading too much in to the characters and writing style of the author. But I do think there is an important message in this book."
bookclub,"I've given The Sun Also Rises 10 chapters now, and, honestly, I see myself dropping it. It feels less like a novel at this point and more like a descriptive telling of every event Jake is going through. Should I push through?"
bookclub,"In this section, Jake and co first go to a rural town for fishing, then onto to Pamplona for the bull fight. There is a lot more nature in this section, which is a contrast with previous scenes in the city. They actually do things here - dig for worms, catch fish etc, and it brings a sense of peace they didn't have in the city. There is competition in the fishing, but it is simple, and doesn't make anyone feel insecure. They can actually speak honestly about Brett (Bill asks if Jake was in love with her). But as soon as he hears from Brett, Jake leaves this relative peace behind.      

There's a further hint about Jake's injury - Bill says that some people think Jake is impotent. Jake responds that he isn't, he's just had an accident. Jake is worried that Bill will stop teasing him for fear of hurting his feelings - he actually wants Bill to tease him, to be treated normally.       

I was quite interested in the section where Bill tells Jake that he is more fond of him than anyone else, and that he couldn't say that in New York because people would think he was a 'faggot'. It's a continuation of the masculine imagine theme. During the war, they came to have really intense bonds, taking care of each other, but they actually feel insecure about those feelings now.       

What do you think about the section with the bulls in Chapter 13? Jake and Montoya agree they have a bad feeling about the bulls, which seems ominous.      

Anything in particular stand out for you?
Anything you want to discuss from this section, or the book so far? Over to you!"

*I, Tituba, Black Witch of Salem* is a novel about a young slave girl, taking place in Barbados and Salem. Tituba was a real person, and really was the first person accused in the Salem Witch Trials. *I, Tituba* takes an imaginative look at Tituba and her life

We want to move the subreddit toward more obscure works, so for September we’ll looking specifically for authors who aren’t particularly well-known.

1. Not an author in the below list 

2. But on par with the authors below, so no Stephen Kings, J. K. Rowlings or Neil Gaimans 

3. Not generally well-known; I left C. S. Lewis and Don DeLillo out on purpose just so I could point out that they're not good choices either for this exact reason 

4. Not something we’ve done before 

5. Has not had a movie made about it, or at least not in English

bookclub,"We're almost halfway through the book now, and are now in Spain. Are you enjoying it? Why? Why not? I'll confess, I'm not, which disappoints me because I've enjoyed Hemingway in the past. I'm finding it hard work in places, and I don't care for all the detail about Paris streets, but more on that below.      

Does anybody else sometimes have trouble knowing who's saying what? Several times, there is a group of people, and they make several statements, one after the other, with no indication of who's speaking. Do you think this is deliberate? What effect does it have? Or is it just me?!!      

In the previous scheduled post, u/derkkaa asked why there is so much detail given about Paris street names - paragraphs describing Jake going from one street to another. They are constantly moving, looking for something or somewhere new, even going to Spain. Is this listing of street names done to give the impression of constant movement? Is it part of a stream of consciousness narrative? What do you think about this?     

There is a lot of competition between the men, often focused on Brett. We learn that Brett has been away with Cohn, which prompts Jake's jealousy. Jake is also jealous when seeing Brett with Mike. As they travel out to Spain, this competition eases, but when the subject of Brett's arrival is raised, competition comes back in the form of the bet between Cohn and Bill. All of this seems to be about the characters trying to assert their masculinity, which, along with insecurity, is a recurring theme.      

What are your thoughts on this section, and the book so far? Any parts that particularly interested you? Are you still finding it witty?"
bookclub,"This is the scheduled post for ch 28-30 in our Big Read, Jane Eyre.
In comments below, share your thoughts -- any passages you like? 
How are themes developed?  As always, it's fine to start a separate
thread to pursue one topic, and fine to talk about earlier parts of 
the book.

Next Saturday, Aug 17, will chapters 31-33

Recap: Ch 28:

Having fled Thornfield and Rochester, Jane spends a night sleeping
in a field, then unsuccessfully seeks work in a small village.  The next
night, near starving, she comes on a cottage in the woods; is rebuffed
by the housekeeper but given shelter by The Man of The House.

Ch 29: Jane recovers in the house for three days and is given a welcome
by a family who turn out to be gathered after the death of their father.

Ch 30: St John Rivers was planning on opening a school for girls and
offers the role of teaching it it to Jane."
bookclub,"There are several themes in this book. One thing that struck me was the turnover of relationships - there is a lot of casual mention of divorce. Brett talks about her divorce, and also about marrying someone else, while seemingly having some kind of relationship with Jake. Do you think the characters seem quite casual about relationships, even marriage (or end of marriage)?    

There's another small hint about Jake's injury - he met Brett in the hospital when she was working as a volunteer nurse, presumably he was a patient.    

The lost generation seems to be a continuing theme in this book. They are all drinking to forget - note Brett's claims not to remember because she was drunk. The Count however, seems separate from this - he drinks, but he actually enjoys alcohol. Has his life not been as affected by the war as the others? But he does have a wound. Or is it because he has been involved in several wars, so WWI didn't have the same impact on him? I'm finding it interesting how we're given the impression that the war had a big impact on these characters, without being told much about the actual war.

I just recently discovered this subreddit, and although I already find it to be a great way to share thoughts about literature, I was wondering whether it would be possible to host some sort of live discussion around books that are currently read by the club, through platforms such as discord or skype, which I feel would allow for more dynamic exchange. As a native english speaker living a non-anglophone country, I don't really have access to real life english book clubs, and such an outlet for oral exchange would be fantastic.

Thoughts?

In contrast to the extreme emphasis on empathy in last month's read, I am shocked by the lack of empathy in this novel. I'm certain it only surprised me because of the book I read before, but what do you think? Do the characters initially present as selfish, uncaring, and somewhat mean?

For the September read, we will be attempting something new. We are initiating a **Discovery Read**. When we announce these reads, attached will be a list of authors that are *not allowed*. You can nominate pretty much anything else that does not otherwise violate our normal rules, but we are hoping for more challenging reads that force us to take our discussion a bit farther. 

This will likely occur every few months, like our Gutenberg and Big reads. I am only mentioning it now so we can keep our eyes peeled for things we might want to nominate. We will be posting the restricted list soon, so everyone can look it over and voice any concerns."

week, Aug 3, just two chapters, 26 and 27.   [Here is the schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/bvoqqv/jane_eyre_schedule/)


Well, the novel take a sharp turn, there are open declarations, the
narrative plunges toward marriage, the traditional culmination of love
stories.  It must be a head-fake, since we're just past half-way thru
the novel.  Or will this be a mold breaker, with the marriage just
a stopping point in R &amp; J's relationship?

What passages, themes, techniques struck you as notable in this week's
reading?  


A summary of this week's events

Ch 23: Cigar-smelling Rochester extracts a declaration of love
from Jane and returns it.  Their kissing in the hall scandalizes Fairfax.

Ch 24: Off to town to buy dresses; a fairy story for Adèle about taking
Jane to the moon; singing at the fireplace.

Ch 25: The day before the wedding; at her master's knee Jane tells him
of the dream and apparition that rent the real veil; he tells her it
must have been Grace Poole."

bookclub,"PKD believed that conformity to potentially oppressive forces like government, media, or even parents was a trait of android behavior. And, his view was that the ability to rebel against or defy oppressive forces was a hallmark of human behavior. Accordingly, when reading DADoES we have to consider which characters are conforming and which are rebelling.

What did you find interesting in chapters 11-15?"
bookclub,This is the discussion post for chapters 21-22 of Jane Eyre. What are your thoughts?
bookclub,I just finished the English translation of the book and thought it was absolutely beautiful and engaging from start to finish. Garcia Márquez' use of language is so magical in that it lends otherworldly significance to common everyday things and vice versa. I am amazed that these images came out so well in the translation and just wondered for anyone who has read both the Spanish original and the translation whether they found the original was better and whether many things were lost in translation. I've heard many people say that the translation is excellent but have also heard people who think that the original is the only way to read it.
bookclub,"Is anyone interested in doing a read through of this alongside me? I am at chapter 8 right now, about 70 pages in. I love Steinbeck, so far I've read Of mice and men (for school) and Sweet Thursday and Cannery Row. Those two books are easily two of my favourites. I love Steinbecks use of imagery, and his dialogue. I'm high functioning autistic so sometimes find emotions and motives hard to grasp when reading a novel, despite struggling with that I enjoy and deal well with the more abstract ideas some authors put into their works; along those lines, it's probably no surprise that I enjoy Joyce and Virginia Woolf, who are both said to have been autistic. Anyway, I'd love to have some discussions on The Grapes of Wrath. If there is any interest please say so below and we'll see if we can get something sorted. :D"
bookclub,"Alright welcome to round two of this great adventure.
If you want to start a topic on a new theme or point use the #### formatting in your comment to bold your theme and draw attention.

Some topics just to start this off

7-10 was heavily focused on Rick as a bounty Hunter and his shift from unquestioning to trying and deal with some of the issues or ironies he sees in the world  around him. Namely, when is an Android a human or can an Android be a human. It's gone from is an Android a human merely because it acts and looks like one, to is it human if it has memories/thinks it is a human? 

Confused myself on who is human and who isn't, I turned to Google for some advice and found something interesting. Chapter 10 is purposefully confusing to start shifting the reader's perception. It is meant to confuse the reader and to distort the idea of humanity. Was anyone else confused by this chapter? Does anyone have any predictions about certain characters or their fate?


What do you think of the different tests used to determine Android or human? I thought of some comparisons to modern Turing test."

I have decided that I am going to choose between Oliver Ready's and, Pevear and Volokhonsky's translations. But some people insist that I pick David Mcduff's or Coulson translation or Michael Katz's. I am very stressed due to my indecision, ironic, and I need a conclusive answer!"
bookclub,"So I offered to do the first two discussions and I apologise for how late this one is today. I have been caught up in my job.

I couldn't help myself but read some primers to get discussions going. A lot of what I read points to empathy as a major theme in this book.

I wanted to talk about that theme and how the author is setting up that theme. I think that the most obvious way the author expresses this is directly in the first chapter. The entire chapter is practically dedicated to owning a pet. The love and care and symbiotic relationship humans have with pets is not to be down played. We have pets for little other reason now a days but for love. This really humanizes the cyborg idea and makes the characters far more relatable. The electric animals aren't good enough, robots are cold and uncaring this highlights the duality of the cyborg."
bookclub,"This post covers discussion of all of part 3, and the book as a whole. This is the final scheduled (but late!) post, but of course continue to make your own posts if you wish.    

Sorry for the delay in this everyone. I've taken over from u/inclinedtothelie for this last post but I've been really behind on my reading. But I've finished now! Who else has finished? What did you think? Was it your first reading? If not, has anything changed in your perception since last time? For those who haven't finished, are you still going? Or have you given up?     

So in part 3...     
*Winston is in the Ministry of Love, and we first hear about room 101, and that O'Brien is actually working for the Party. Were you surprised by this? Winston and Julia took a huge risk by trusting him, and it seems not to have paid off. Why do you think Winston did trust O'Brien?        
*In chapter 3, Winston is convinced that the Party will fail eventually: he says 'I don't know - I don't care. Somehow you will fail. Something will defeat you. Life will defeat you.' Do you think he's right? What would it take for the Party to be defeated?      
*In the end, Winston wins 'the victory over himself. He loved Big Brother'. What do you think of the ending? Did you expect it to end this way? Do you think it's important it ended this way?      

Some other questions:     
*What do you think about Newspeak? Do you think it is possible to establish Newspeak as the only language, as they intend eventually to do? Does language control the scope of human thought?      
*Are the means or the ends of a political agenda more important when evaluating morality?       
*For a person to be considered sane, must others share their perceptions?"

bookclub,"Hi, guys. 

I know I really fell flat on Orwell's *1984* this month. I'll just explain real quick. Basically, in January my daughter attempted to kill herself. Since then we've had multiple attempts and lots of hospital stays. Currently, we have her placed in a long-term assessment facility, so I have spent every weekend at the facility with her. 

This weekend is Canada Day long weekend and my daughter is in our home for the first time in a long time as a trial to see if she is ready to come home for good. This is the first trial of 2. So this weekend, I'm focus on her. 

As a result of all of this, I've been behind all year. I'm sorry for that. Now, I will get the schedule posted for *Electric Sheep* by Tuesday evening, PDT. My daughter will be back at her facility by then and I'll have time to recuperate and make the schedule. As for 1984, if anyone wants to post a final discussion post, I'll gladly pin it to the top to encourage others to participate, but I just don't have it in me right now. 

I hope you can understand. Thanks guys.

bookclub,"There've been a few things that seem like they might be laying the groundwork for coming plot:

&amp;#x200B;

Most obviously, her relative's visit to Gateshead.  

Also, I wonder if Mrs. Reed's various documents that she keeps in the red room prefigure some complicated legal matter that the Reed househhold is involved in.  The wording where she said no one goes in the room except the maid ""and Mrs. Reed herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the contents of a certain secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored divers parchments""... we know very little about Gateshead -- there is a book about birds and divers parchments.

&amp;#x200B;

Mrs Reed insisting that she is Jane's friend is odd -- ""Is there anything else you wish for, Jane?  I assure you, I desire to be your friend.”  -- it's not necessarily *true* that the visitor to the house was a well-disposed relative of Jane's -- it could be that Mrs. Reed is entangled in something that endangers the family's wealth and Jane threatens someone's interest -- that there's an inheritance complication  plot.  The insistence by John Reed ""For it is my book"", along with ""divers parchments"" at the very beginning could be a hint that something is coming by way of asking who is rightul heir to the Reed estate.

&amp;#x200B;

It just occurred to me she's sort of an orphan hidden in the Reeds -- sort of like Moses in the bulrushes.

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder too if Maria Temple will come back into the plot.  She had relatively much development for relatively little move-the-story-forward."

Throughout the text, Orwell is consistent in saying what is happening cannot be avoided. Syme's death, his meeting with O'Brien, even his affair with Julia. It goes on and on.

bookclub,"Here's the scheduled post for the Summer Big Read, Jane Eyre.  This
week's post covers Ch 5-8; next checkin is June 22 for Chapters 9
through 11.

General ""Prompt"" questions:

Below are some miscellaneous notes of what I noticed as I was reading.
What scenes strike you as memorable? Any particular phrases?  Does the
story, or do the characters remind you of other books/real world
people and events?  How would you synopsize each chapter?  Feel free
to throw in your own questions, and if you want to follow up on any
aspect in more detail, post a new thread.

Do keep conversation to the first 8 chapters (always fine to go back
and remark on more from earlier posts)

Minimal synopsis:

V: Carriage ride &amp; Arrival and First Day at Lowood
VI: Extending acquaintance with the Philosophic Ms Burns
VII: First Quarter; Grinding Routine, Persecution
VIII: Reprieve, exoneration

Theme: Up trough chapter 8, tis is a book about experiencing and reacting to
oppression, exploitation and cruelty.  At Lowood all the weaker girls
are victimized by the older; Burns is singled out by Scatcherd and
Jane by Brocklehurst for what appear to be sadistic gratification.

Overall the most remarkable thing to me is Burns's attitude of
cheerful submission and confidence in ultimate reconciliation of all
people. Esp, paraphrase: you shouldn't worry about pain that only you
feel.

The attitude Helen Burns takes toward Scatcherd, and toward Jane's
rebellion against punishment is one of active complicity; not only
does she counsel against rebellion, at least for her own part she
justifies Scatcherd behavior, which to the reader, like Jane, is
unreasonable: ""Why didn't you clean your hands in that frozen water.""

The way Helen parses experience: she claims the ability to tell Jane
is honest ""I read a sincere nature in your ardent eyes and on your
clear front""; but she doesn't condemn others for not being able to do
so.


Scenes:

The scenes that stand out to me are the carriage ride; the freezing
2nd morning at Lowood; Burns submitting to the flail, and brushing
away a tear as she returns from putting it away.

Narrative arrangement: 

Only after her persecution by Brocklehurst does Jane reveal she had,
prior to his branding her a liar, begun to gain acceptance by her
peers and teachers (start Ch VIII)

Foreshadowing of Helen's sickness (I assume), the cough in VI, in VIII
Temple asking if her cough was better then ""her spirit seemed
hastening to live within a very brief span"" after she eats tea and
seedcake; then Temple's tear as she lets Helen go.

Arriving at Lowood, Jane's ""puzzling to make out the subject of a
picture on the wall"" when Temple comes in.  I wonder if this is just
scene painting or if we'll find out more about the picture?

Jane delivers ""extra"" info by observant glimpse: e.g. Burns wiping
a tear; Temple wiping a tear; the teachers sampling the disgusting
porridge.

Mood/texture:

The barked orders in first day: ""Silence!"", ""Monitors, do X!""  Impersonal,
staccato.

Gothic/romantic language

VIII ""the spasm of agony which clutched my heart wen Mrs. Reed spurned my
wild supplication for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark
and haunted chamber.""

V: ""great grey hills heaved up round the horizon: as twilight
deepened, we descended a valley, dark with wood, and long after night
had overclouded the prospect, I heard a wild wind rushing amongst
trees.""

Lost opportunity: when Jane is left alone in a room in an Inn, start
chapter V, I don't think Bronte conveys the error of the scene memorably; her
dramatic development is stronger than her introspective/mood painting.
Although the feeling of comfort at end of ch VIII is good.  Better
at comfort than creepiness?

Interesting observation, end of VIII: ""such spots are on the disc of
the clearest planet"" -- she's thinking of looking thru a telescope --
""and eyes like Miss Scathcerd's can only see those minute defects"" --
maybe there is something to this, it is talking not just about carping
Scatcherd, but about the imperfections of creation, the gap between
conception of god-created cosmos and what planets actually are.

Some vocabulary/words:

Missis: I never saw that spelling of Missus  
cord: To arrange (wood, etc.) in a pile for measurement by the cord. (a cord is 4x4x8 ft of firewood)
great girls: older girls, older and bigger  
Collect: a prayer for a given day
hebdomadal: weekly.  The first time I saw this word, I sent it to a friend of mine who likes weird words.  
surtout: from Fr. ""above all"", a man's overcoat  
phylactery: in Jewish tradition leather cases containing verses from Torah worn around the head and heart; Jane compares Helen's sign saying ""Slattern"" to that.  
Cuyp: was a painter  
Barmecide supper: From wiktionary: something that promises much but delivers nothing; an illusion.  Jane fantasizes about good food; it had been her habit, going to sleep to "" prepare in imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast beef"""
bookclub,"I really miss talking to people in grad school about books, so I wrote out what I think of these two books and how they relate to each other and made videos about it (Collected Fictions: [https://youtu.be/y2Q0zN3R6JU](https://youtu.be/y2Q0zN3R6JU) and House of Leaves: [https://youtu.be/\_2yUcr3ufA0](https://youtu.be/_2yUcr3ufA0) ). But I still haven't gotten my discussion fix on these two and how they relate. I know many of you have read Borges and House of Leaves, which is why I'm posting. I feel like there is no House of Leaves without Borges. I'm not sure many people know Borges work, but Danielewski is now a huge catch for a book tour, and he even brings up Pierre Menard, so I'm curious how much you think Danielewski was influenced by Borges and how much you think House of Leaves possibly got people reading Borges."
bookclub,"Hey, 

Due to some personal issues, I missed posting the last discussion post. Since it is already the 12, I am going to just combine the posts. 

In Chapter 5 we meet Syme and Parsons. We get to see the difference between an intelligent Party member and a drone, both swallowing the Party's nonsense completely. Winston even expects Syme to be vaporized at some point in the future based on his intelligence, even though he is completely supportive of The Party. 

In Chapter 6 we find Winston again writing in his diary. He is recounting a sexual encounter and he struggles to get it all down, in part because the woman he slept with was ""old"". He despises the way The Party has vilified sex, making it appear like a disgusting act, and one of his desires is to arouse a woman. I think, in part, that it is ""wrong"" is what excites him. 

We also find here that Winston was married. His wife was named Katharine and she only wanted sex to reproduce as it was their ""duty to the party"". They were married 15 months and he has not seen her in more than 9 years. What do you think about The Party's view on sex? Do you think this level of control is possible? 

In Chapter 7, I think we see the outline of the world Orwell was building. 

&gt;The ideal set up by the Party was something huge, terrible, and glittering—a world of steel and concrete, of monstrous machines and terrifying weapons—a nation of warriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting—three hundred million people all with the same face. The reality was decaying, dingy cities where underfed people shuffled to and fro in leaky shoes, in patched-up nineteenth-century houses that smelt always of cabbage and bad lavatories. He seemed to see a vision of London, vast and ruinous, city of a million dustbins, and mixed up with it was a picture of Mrs. Parsons, a woman with lined face and wispy hair, fiddling helplessly with a blocked waste-pipe.

The contrast presented here is important, I think. It makes me wonder how so many members of the Party can just ignore the truth. I understand ""doublethink"" is at play, and perhaps many think they are just among the few and millions more are perfectly happy, but I struggle to believe that. 

&gt; The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.

But even with this, he knows the Party lies, because he has caught them in a lie. At his job, he receives orders to change history at regular intervals, but in one instance he is given undeniable proof that the Party is lying. There is a photo of three men, Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford, who had been convicted of crimes against the party. 

&gt; The point was that at both trials all three men had confessed that on that date they had been on Eurasian soil. They had flown from a secret airfield in Canada to a rendezvous somewhere in Siberia, and had conferred with members of the Eurasian General Staff, to whom they had betrayed important military secrets. The date had stuck in Winston’s memory because it chanced to be midsummer day; but the whole story must be on record in countless other places as well. There was only one possible conclusion: the confessions were lies.

In Chapter 8, Winston leaves work to walk among the Proles. 

&gt; But if there was hope, it lay in the proles. You had to cling on to that. When you put it in words it sounded reasonable: it was when you looked at the human beings passing you on the pavement that it became an act of faith.

Winston ends up meeting an elderly Prole and buys him a beer in hopes of learning more about the time before the revolution. He is disappointed to find the man either cannot recall the time before the revolution or will not discuss it, other than snippets of memories. Afterward, while lost in thought, Winston returns to the shop where he purchased his diary. There, he converses with the shop owner, a man in his 60's, who does recall an earlier London. Winston enjoys the shop and the man's stories and resolves to return in a month. However, upon exiting the shop, he is confronted by the girl from the Fiction Department, who he suspects is a spy. He ponders murdering her but instead returns home. 

That sums up the end of Part I. What sticks out to you here? What do you want to discuss about what you've read in Part I? 

Now, on to Part II. 

In Chapter 1 we finally learn what the dark-haired girl from the Fiction Department wants from Winston. She's in love with him, he finds out, when she passes him a note in a corridor. Through a series of intricate steps, they plan a meeting. 

Chapter two is all about their meeting and I think it is summed up nicely by this line: 

&gt; Their embrace had been a battle, the climax a victory. It was a blow struck against the Party. It was a political act.

They risked everything to be together for only a short while. This is so inspiring to me, and yet so shocking. How do you feel about it? Can you see yourself risking your life for this type of interaction? 

In Chapter 3, I believe we learn why, according to Julia: 

&gt; “When you make love you’re using up energy; and afterwards you feel happy and don’t give a damn for anything. They can’t bear you to feel like that. They want you to be bursting with energy all the time. All this marching up and down and cheering and waving flags is simply sex gone sour. If you’re happy inside yourself, why should you get excited about Big Brother and the Three-Year Plans and the Two Minutes Hate and all the rest of their bloody rot?”

In the end, Winston goes on about his general lack of hope saying, 

&gt; We are the dead.

But Julia counters with a bit of optimism. 

&gt; We're not dead yet.

In Chapter 4, I am touched by the importance of the paperweight. Why do you think Orwell is placing such emphasis on this seemingly useless item from the past? What does it represent to you? 

In Chapter 5, Syme vanishes. In addition, we see the effect Julia is having on Winston: 

&gt; Winston had dropped his habit of drinking gin at all hours. He seemed to have lost the need for it. He had grown fatter, his varicose ulcer had subsided, leaving only a brown stain on the skin above his ankle, his fits of coughing in the early morning had stopped. The process of life had ceased to be intolerable, he had no longer any impulse to make faces at the telescreen or shout curses at the top of his voice.

In contrast, Julia does not seem changed by her interaction with Winston. She doesn't believe in the Party's propaganda, but she only considers it as it directly affects her. Winston is even concerned that she seems to buy into the Party's lies about who it is at war with from moment to moment. She has no concern over the Party's lies at all. 

&gt; Talking to her, he realized how easy it was to present an appearance of orthodoxy while having no grasp whatever of what orthodoxy meant. 

Okay, that's the current chapters. What do you think? What quotes made an impression on you? How are you finding the book? What themes do you think are exceptionally important?"
bookclub,"So! What do we all think of Jane Eyre?

I’ve never read this book and went in not knowing what to expect. I’ve only read one other Brontë novel, which was Wuthering Heights, and while that was a different sister I assumed they’d have similar voices. Not so!

The book opens with Jane, ten years old, an orphan raised by her aunt from infancy and treated only mildly better than Harry Potter. She’s tormented by her older cousin and experiences a series of unfair events, which culminates in her expulsion from the house and into boarding school, which she thinks will be a relief. (I’m guessing it won’t be.)

I don’t have a great handle on this novel yet, and I’m having a difficult time picking out symbolism, because I don’t know where it’s going. (BTW, I know this book is 172 years old, but no spoilers, please!) I’m struck by young Jane’s erudition and sense of injustice, though, and by “struck”, I mean I’m having a difficult time suspending my disbelief that an emotionally- and occasionally physically-abused kid feels entitled to be treated like her cousins are. The Victorians weren’t known for their accomplishments in child psychology, and interestingly, Brontë seems to misunderstand her young protagonist just like Jane’s “benefactors” misunderstand her, though to different effect. They attribute motives and a nature to Jane that she just doesn’t possess, and Brontë has written a little girl in a bad situation who, amazingly, doesn’t hate herself.

But we forgive Harry Potter for not being a complete mess, and I can forgive Jane, too. The neat thing is that Brontë has ALSO written a little girl who is opinionated, confident, and has a sense of her own worth that I can only dream of. That seems absolutely groundbreaking today, and in 1847? I wonder if it was published and read by a generation of little girls who found inspiration and strength in Jane’s willingness to stand up for herself. She doesn’t seem to know quite what she wants, but feels that the way she’s been treated is wrong, even in the face of adult manipulation, like that of the doctor: isn’t she happy to live in a house like this? Isn’t she glad that her aunt took her in? And now she has an inkling that her reputation as a liar is going to follow her to boarding school, but she’s gamely ready to face it.

Also, I can’t stop laughing about the scene where she’s so sure that Mr. Reed, deceased, would be so indignant at her treatment that he’d rise from the dead to help her, and she freaks out because she’s afraid of ghosts. A+.

So! Let’s talk. WITHOUT SPOILERS, what did you like, what did you dislike? Is this your first trip through the book, or a later one? Did you pick up on any symbolism, any themes? Want to disagree with me? I can’t wait to read your responses."
bookclub,"Hello! 

Before we get started, I would like to make some ground rules. 

1. Be civil. This book is a dystopian novel and has some political comments. Someone may make a comment about that, but that does not entitle you to be rude. Any inappropriate, intolerant, or hateful comments will be removed and may result in a temporary or permanent ban. 

2. Be open-minded. Consider what is being said in the comments and respond thoughtfully. Even if you disagree, at least try to be open-minded and consider where the community member is coming from. 

Okay, I think we can get started now. 

So, we open 1984 by meeting Winston, a 39-year-old man living in London. It becomes increasingly clear as the chapter continues that London has become a broken city and part of the larger Oceania. Orwell does a fantastic job of describing London here, from the dilapidated houses to the soaring government buildings, I so value the visual he provides. 

The motto of the Party is: War is Peace; Freedom is Slavery; Ignorance is Strength. What do you think about this motto? Why do you think he chose these words, in this order? 

The four branches of government in Oceania: 

* Minitrue: The Ministry of Truth - News, entertainment, education, fine arts.

* Minipax: The Ministry of Peace - War

* Miniluv: The Ministry of Love - Law, order

* Miniplenty: The Ministry of Plenty - Economic affairs

We find out later that while Winston believes it is approximately April 4, 1984, he cannot be certain. I find this interesting because I think it has got to be difficult for a government to do away with dates, and I wonder how it happened. 

Now, Winston's first journal entry really stuck out to me. He went to the movies to watch war films, and the way it is written makes it sound like these are documentaries more than fictional films. Did anyone else get that from the text? The idea of these atrocities, of refugees being blasted out of the water, horrifies and saddens me. But the people in the theater are cheering and laughing. 

During the two-minute hate, we meet the anonymous Fiction worker, a nice-looking female that Winston despises, and O'Brien, a man from the Inner Party who Winston seems to think might be a bit unorthodox, but he doesn't know why. Finally, we meet the Enemy of the State, Emmanuel Goldstein. He was apparently a big figure in the early days of Oceania, but did not like the way the government was heading, was arrested, and went into hiding. 

&gt; He was the primal traitor, the earliest defiler of the Party’s purity. All subsequent crimes against the Party, all treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations, sprang directly out of his teaching.

What did you guys think about the two-minute hate (and the event that caused Winston to start the diary that day)? The idea that placing a group of humans in a room together, inundating them with pictures and sounds contrary to their daily beliefs, and then allowing them to go crazy yelling and screaming, is particularly interesting to me. That they didn't even have to fake it, is particularly jarring. 

&gt; Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary. A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one even against one’s will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic. 

In Chapter 2, we get to see the Children of Oceania. Holy crap did those Parsons children scare me. What did you all think of them? This idea that they had been indoctrinated at 7 and 9.

&gt; But what most struck Winston was the look of helpless fright on the woman’s greyish face.

The next quote that seems important to me is: 

&gt; We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness. 

The Sacred Principles of Ingsoc [English Socialism]:

* Newspeak

* Doublethink

* Mutability of the Past

So, why is Winston keeping this diary? We finally learn at the end of Chapter 2: 

&gt; He was a lonely ghost uttering a truth that nobody would ever hear. But so long as he uttered it, in some obscure way the continuity was not broken. It was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried on the human heritage.

In Chapter 3, Orwell makes an interesting point: 

&gt; When there were no external records that you could refer to, even the outline of your own life lost its sharpness.

What do you think, accurate? Inaccurate? Why? 

We learn later in Chapter 3 that The Party controls history as well. 

&gt; At this moment, for example, in 1984 (if it was 1984), Oceania was at war with Eurasia and in alliance with Eastasia. In no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along different lines. Actually, as Winston well knew, it was only four years since Oceania had been at war with Eastasia and in alliance with Eurasia... The enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil...

What do you think about this way of thinking? This control over history? This control over the truth?

bookclub,"Since the spirit banquet scene, Prospero has charmed the King and lords to hold them motionless. After Ariel discusses the sympathy he would feel if he was human for the frozen characters, Prospero decides to end his punishments.

&gt;“The rarer action is in virtue than in vengeance.”

Prospero also renounces his own magical art. All the others are sorry for their actions and Prospero is placed back as Duke of Milan while his daughter will become Queen of Naples when she marries Ferdinand. Even Caliban realizes his error in trying to follow Stephano.

&gt;“What a thrice-double ass was I, to take this drunkard for a god. And worship this dull fool!”

Ariel is also set free to live as he wants on the island after safely sending the others on the ship back to Naples. And all will supposedly live happily ever after. 

Then the Epilogue takes on another somber tone similar to the one Prospero took after ending the masque. Prospero is speaking directly to the audience during the epilogue. He again discusses his time running out and asks the audience to release him with their clapping.

&gt;“Let your indulgence set me free.”

I thoroughly enjoyed *The Tempest*, and I hope all of you who read it enjoyed it as well! I loved the magic of the setting and the prose in this play. While I felt things turned a bit too quickly and neatly in the last act, I was happy that all of the characters got a nice ending. I think this might be the first Shakespeare play I’ve read that had a happy ending. Does anyone have other recommendations for me of Shakespeare plays that end on a nice note?

Questions:

1) What are your overall impressions of the play?

2) In what ways do the characters change in Act 5 and why?

3) Do you think Shakespeare was using this play to say goodbye to theatre?"
bookclub,"I’m sorry for the lateness and the brevity, you guys, I’m burning out hard. I need a week off work and I’m not going to get it.

Anyway, when last we saw our protagonist, he was riding off into the sunset with his Dulcinea. I’m having a hard time coming up with the words for this comparison, it’s almost 11pm here and I am a long way from my last dose of coffee. But we’ve spent the entire book looking at Myrna through some distorting lens or another: Ignatius, the professor, her own letters. Then she actually shows up.

The professor thinks she and Ignatius were cut from the same cloth. Do you see any outside evidence of this? Maybe in her letters?

What do you think she does for Ignatius? She’s the knight in shining armor here, obviously, packing him out of his mother’s house before the ambulance can drag him to the mental hospital. But what ELSE does she do for him? I think if most of us were getting letters like she sends him, we’d start throwing them in the trash unread, but Ignatius engages with him, and she with him. She’s got his number, she knows what he’s like, and yet she not only drops everything to come and get him, she doesn’t dump him on the side of the road when he immediately treats her badly.

Do you think Ignatius has delusions about Myrna the way that Don Quixote did about Dulcinea?

And, frankly... there’s a lot in this last section. I can’t even touch it all. How does Jones come off? Is there maybe some symbolism hidden in the disastrous show? (I still maintain that “confederacy” is some nod to the setting.) Does everyone get their best possible ending, and what huge thing goes wrong to get them there?

What did you think? Did you pick up on anything you want to talk about?"
bookclub,"I'm sorry! It was an unavoidably busy day, and we're a day late now."
bookclub,"This is the home stretch! We’ve got a couple more sections to go and then it’s on to June’s selections.

We don’t really have a high-stakes plot here; we can contrast it with any number of books that do, like next month’s 1984 or White Noise or Revolutionary Road. The world isn’t in danger of ending; no one seems like they’re going to have a devastating divorce or die. But there is a plot. Confederacy seems to straddle the line between character-driven and plot-driven, where it’s more a study of its characters than anything, but the author is also setting up some reader expectations that feel more at home in a thriller. One of the things they’ll tell you in an intermediate writing course is that you have to fulfill your promises to the reader; while it’s not quite the same thing, I want to mention Chekhov’s shotgun. If there’s a shotgun on the wall in the first act, it needs to go off in the third.

So what are these promises that JKT is making to his readers? We’re far enough in that we’ve seen the basic trajectory for each character’s story. What does the author have to wrap up before the book is done, and where do you expect each character to wind up?

Did you notice anything in this section? There have been so few comments. Talk to me! Even something like “I thought it was funny when ___” or “It’s cool to see Mrs. Reilly standing up for herself” is welcome!"
bookclub,"Lord of the Rings came in with a lot of votes this time around, and was ultimately ineligible because it’s three massive books. I think our usual three-month Big Read timespan isn’t quite enough for this one and want to propose doing a longer Big Read in the fall/winter over 4-6 months.

What’s the level of interest for that? Would anyone want to take point on read running?"

(I saw some discussion in the comments about how it wasn’t quite 600 pages. By trying to eliminate too-short books, I inadvertently created a no man’s land of 5-600 pages that weren’t eligible for the regular read or the big read. Since it was very close to 600 pages, and I was able to find copies online that were &gt; 600, we’re calling it good.)"
bookclub,"We will be reading 1984 by George Orwell. 

Schedule to come, read runners wanted. Feel free to message the mods to volunteer or with questions."
bookclub,"  Prospero finally releases Ferdinand from his labor and gives his blessing for the marriage to Miranda. While Miranda is present for Ferdinand and Prospero’s discussion, she is given no speaking part during it. Prospero is focused on making sure Ferdinand understands that Miranda must remain a virgin until after they are wed.

&gt;“Therefore take heed, As Hymen’s lamps shall light you.”

As a gift to the young couple, Prospero puts on a play with the spirits featuring Iris (personification of a rainbow connecting Heaven &amp; Earth), Ceres (Roman goddess for cultivated and fruitful soil), and Juno (considered by Romans to be the idealized wife). The characters of this play-within-a-play bestow their blessings on the couple and further emphasize chastity before marriage.

Of historical note, one of the earlier productions of this play (winter 1612-1613) was during the festivities in preparation for the marriage of Elizabeth, daughter of King James I.

Prospero ends the play suddenly because he remembers that he has to deal with Caliban’s plot to kill him. Despite the happy occasion, the play takes a somber turn. Prospero appears to lament on mortality. Some critics believe this is actually Shakespeare speaking through Prospero. 

&gt;“We are such stuff as dreams are made on.”

Prospero and Ariel deal with Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo swiftly by having the spirits appear as hounds to chase them off. Prospero disparages Caliban’s character and takes no responsibility for how Caliban has turned out.

&gt;“A devil, a born devil, on whose nature nurture can never stick: on whom my pains, humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost.”

Some critics have suggested that the isolation of the island allows the characters to give up their morality and fully embrace their nature.

Questions:

1) In what ways do the characters in *The Tempest* appear to give up their humanity in favor of their nature?

2) During Prospero’s somber speech at the end of the masque, he calls theatre an “insubstantial pageant.” What do you think could be causing Shakespeare to write off his own craft in such a way?

3) Do you think Prospero has any blame for how Caliban turned out?"
bookclub,"Quick one tonight, as this was a busier weeknight than expected. I’ll be around tomorrow to discuss in the comments.

Who’s still with us? Who’s behind, who’s caught up?

I want to talk about the nature of delusion in this novel but wondering if someone else will run with that idea and get us started. One of the most famous sections in Don Quixote is when DQ tries to fight a set of windmills, believing them to be giants. What is the equivalent for Ignatius?

Is there a difference in the way he deludes himself, as opposed to others? Do you think he’s more convincing to himself than to others?"
bookclub,"  In Act 3, Shakespeare moves around the island and we get to see what is happening with the three different groups of characters. We start with Miranda and Ferdinand, who is carrying logs on Prospero’s request. They fawn over one other, profess their love, and speak of their desire to marry.

&gt;“I, beyond all limit of what else i’ the world, do love, prize, honour you.”

In scene 2, Stephano and Caliban bicker with Trinculo which is made worst by Arial’s continuing interjection of “Thou liest,” which Stephano and Caliban believe Trinculo is saying. Caliban comes up with a plan for Stephano to kill Prospero while he naps, take Miranda as his wife, and rule over the island. Stephano, unsurprisingly, heartily agrees to this plan, but Ariel is listening and will warn Prospero of the danger. 

In scene 3, Gonzalo and Alonso grow weary during their search for Ferdinand. Antonio and Sebastian continue to confer about trying to kill the two. A group of spirits appear under Prospero’s direction with a banquet and begin to play music. Then just as suddenly, they disappear. Ariel appears amid thunder and lightning and gives the men a royal telling off, blaming their current predicament on their past sins.

&gt;“For which foul deed the powers, delaying, not forgetting, have incens’d the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures, against your peace.”

Prospero is quite pleased with Ariel’s performance and how well his plans of revenge are going.

One of my favorite things about this play is the mysticism and enchantment of the island. Much of this magical ambiance is brought about by the musical spirits. As Caliban describes it:

“The isle is full of noises, sounds, and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.”

The spectacle is so overwhelming for the stranded that it causes Sebastian to profess a new belief in unicorns. As I read the play, I imagine an island forested similar to Avatar’s Pandora while the spirits sing tunes that sound like the Christmas singing of the Whos down in Whoville. In this strangely imagined scenario, I guess that makes Prospero the grinch (overseeing the inhabitants and plotting his revenge).

Questions:

1) Is there a real or fictional island that you imagine this play taking place on?

2) In what different ways is Prospero exacting his revenge?

3) Much of the action in this play is controlled by Prospero, yet the characters have brought up fate multiple times as the cause. Based on this, do you think Shakespeare is espousing or denouncing a belief in fate and/or destiny?"
bookclub,"Hi, all. Sorry this is a day late; the day got away from me yesterday and then Reddit wouldn't load when I went to post. I want to remind you, if there's anything specific you want to discuss, please feel free to make a post about it! We encourage that.

Despite his best efforts, Ignatius has found a new job peddling hot dogs, and his mother is ashamed. Officer Manusco has an encounter with the old man he wrongly arrested in Chapter 1, and we learn a little more (but not much) about George's grift.

/u/UltraFlyingTurtle brought up Mrs. Reilly's distress at Ignatius's clothing choices, and we see it readily in this section as well--she's pleased when she sees the white apron because she thinks he's a butcher, but after he makes her guess for five minutes what he does, he tells her he's a hot dog seller and she has a meltdown because what will people think? Later on, she (understandably) complains that she has to do a lot of work to get Ignatius's uniform just right; he seems to swing between too dirty and too clean. (It's almost as if it's not about the cleanliness, but his whims.)

Why do you think she's so opposed to meeting Robicheaux? She doesn't seem to change her mind after she's met him. Santa points out that her life is better now that she's met all of them; do you think that's true?

What's George's grift? What's he hiding in the bus station lockers, and why does Lana need a book and a globe?

HAPPY VOTING!"
bookclub," In this short scene, we travel to yet another part of the island. We meet back up with Caliban who crosses paths with Trinculo, a jester, and Stephano, a drunken butler. Trinculo and Stephano both think Caliban looks like a monster. Stephano gives Caliban some of his liquor. Caliban loves the liquor so much, he pledges to serve Stephano, whom he calls a god.

&gt;“I’ll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject, for the liquor is not earthly.”

Stephano claims the island as his own, dismissing Caliban immediately as being owner of the island.

&gt;“The king and all our company else being drowned, we will inherit here.”

Caliban equates serving a new master with actual freedom.

&gt;“Caliban, has a new master – get a new man. Freedom, high-day! High-day, freedom! Freedom, high-day, freedom!”

This exchange between Caliban and Stephano reminds me of Prospero’s dealings with Caliban and Ariel when he came to the island. Like Caliban's yells about freedom with a new master, Prospero thinks Ariel should be grateful for him taking her into his service as that meant freeing her from Sycorax’s confinement.

When Prospero had landed on the island, Caliban showed him all around the island in order to learn his language. Now Caliban is offering Stephano a tour around the island in order to get drunk on Stephano’s alcohol. Stephano happily obliges, and they set off on their tour.

Questions:

1) Why do you think Caliban is so quick to suggest enslaving himself to Stephano (besides just his hatred of Prospero)?

2) Instead of offering Caliban his language like Prospero, Stephano offers alcohol. Do you think this makes Prospero a more moral person than Stephano? Why or why not?

3) In what ways do you see this scene’s themes of power struggles, unending cycles, and levels of immorality still relevant today?"
bookclub,"Tonight’s post is going to be a quick one, and frankly, some of you guys are a lot better at picking out the neat details than I am. I mostly want to talk about race in today’s section. Ignatius has made himself seemingly valuable at Levy Pants, but by doing absolutely useless things and neglecting the work he was hired to do: namely, filing. He goes downstairs to the factory and tries to organize the black factory workers into a riotous strike.

The back of my copy cites Don Quixote, and I think the article/precociously modern blog entry he writes is the best example of his delusion yet. He seems to think he’s something of a folk hero, and has the workers going for a little bit. What do you think his intentions are with this? Do you think he actually means to liberate the working class workers? He paints himself as a white savior, but like a lot of white saviors, he makes the black people do his dirty work, doesn’t understand or address the actual problems, and leaves them in the same position (or worse) that they were in at the beginning.

Jones, on the other hand, seems to be a bit of a foil. He’s got his own problems at work, but he’s against wild ideas like the cockatoo, and he outs Ignatius as a criminal type (though somewhat incorrectly). Interestingly, he’s also onto the orphan scammer. He’s the one under police scrutiny, but he hasn’t actually done a thing wrong, whereas Ignatius is up at work inciting violence. Is JKT maybe saying something about the imbalanced attention of the law?

And last, and completely unrelated, Miss Tricia is the only person who Ignatius actually seems to like. Why is that, do you think?"
bookclub,"The second act takes us to another part of the island where Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Gonzalo, and the other lords have landed. The men spend most of this scene bickering amongst themselves (much like in Act 1, Scene 1). Through their bickering we learn that they were all on the ship because the King of Naples had just married off his daughter to an African king. Most of the men believe Ferdinand to have drowned and the King of Naples is grieving over the loss of both of his heirs.

&gt;“what strange fish Hath made his meal on thee?”

While Sebastian and Antonio gang up on Gonzalo, Gonzalo begins describing what would be his utopia.

&gt;“nature should bring forth, Of it own kind, all foison, all abundance, to feed my innocent people.”

As Shakespeare was known to do, he had lifted parts of Gonzalo’s speech on “the golden age” from another’s work, Michel de Montaigne’s essay “[Of Cannibals](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3600?msg=welcome_stranger).” Montaigne’s essay describes the lifestyle of the Brazilian natives, whom he seems to think are unfairly judged.

&gt;“I find that there is nothing barbarous and savage in this nation, by anything that I can gather, excepting, that every one gives the title of barbarism to everything that is not in use in his own country.”

After Ariel sends all asleep besides Sebastian and Antonio, Antonio convinces Sebastian that with no heir to the throne, the best thing to be done would be to kill Alonso and Gonzalo. Then Sebastian could take the crown for himself. Antonio makes the plan sound as if it is the only logical choice.

&gt;“What’s past is prologue”

Luckily Ariel steps in to save the day by waking Gonzalo before the pair can bring down their swords.

Questions:

1) What do you make of the fact that Gonzalo’s idea of utopia is actually describing the lifestyle of the natives of Brazil? 

2) How would you describe your perfect utopia?"
bookclub,"If you haven't read some of the comments from last week, [I encourage you to go back and look](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/blzpb2/a_confederacy_of_dunces_1_to_2iv/) because some of them are pretty astute.

Some stuff I want to talk about for this section:

1. We're only a quarter of the way into the novel, so maybe this question is too early, but: why do you think it won the Pulitzer Prize? From the Wikipedia article: ""It recognizes distinguished fiction by an American author, preferably dealing with American life ... ."" What kind of American life are we looking at, here?
2. On that note, why New Orleans? I was at a writing seminar recently and the speaker urged us to choose a setting that would be the most appropriate and exciting place to set a story, one that would ""allow you to explore the parts of your premise that you think are the coolest."" Do you think JKT was saying something specifically about NOLA? Would the story be different if it was set in New York City or Memphis?
3. What about the word ""confederacy""? It means an alliance, but Americans most often hear it in the context of the American Civil War. There are SO many politics around this word, from the argument that the war was fought over slavery vs states' rights (...to have slavery, ahem), to the stars and bars being a symbol of southern heritage vs an upsetting racist symbol, to the southern loss of the Civil War being fresh and raw among some southern white folks 150 years after the war ended. Do you think JKT chose this word deliberately?
4. Has anyone picked up on symbols? The green hat is one. What about Fortuna's wheel, or Ignatius's pyloric valve? (I looked it up and it's a sphincter that controls the release of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Hm.)
5. I fully admit that I lurk at /r/justnomil a lot, and they talk about people's ""normal meters"" being off--like a new spouse doesn't realize that their overbearing parents' behavior is Not Normal because it's THEIR normal. Mrs. Reilly's normal meter is broken re: her son, but from time to time she gets reality checks from the outside. What are those reality checks? Who else has a broken normal meter?

Anything else you noticed or want to discuss? I'm all caught up and eager to hear your opinions."
bookclub,"  

In the second scene, we are introduced to the play’s main character, Prospero. We learn that the tempest was actually created by him and his magical “art,” and that the ship’s passengers are all alive and scattered across the island. 

Shakespeare uses Prospero’s dialogue with Miranda and Ariel to give the reader a lot of backstory.

Prospero had been the Duke of Milan, but with the help of the King of Naples, Prospero’s brother overthrew him and sent him and his young daughter to sea. The noble Gonzalo at least sent them with provisions, including Prospero’s books.

&gt;“Knowing I lov’d my books, he furnished me, From mine own library with volumes that I prize above my dukedom.”

Before Prospero and Miranda landed on the island, it had been inhabited by Sycorax. She was a witch who had been banished to the island. Sycorax died, leaving behind a son, Caliban, who Prospero enslaved.

During Prospero’s conversations with Ariel and Caliban, Shakespeare explores a power struggle of the master/slave relationship: which person is actually better off in the relationship?

As Ariel does Prospero’s magical bidding for him, Prospero quickly reminds Ariel that he was the one who rescued her from Sycorax’s confinement. Meanwhile, Caliban feels he was tricked into teaching Prospero everything about the island so that Prospero could take ownership. Prospero points out that he taught Caliban to speak language.

&gt;“You taught me language, and my profit on’t Is, I know how to curse: the red plague rid you, For learning me your language!”

The scene ends with Ferdinand (grieving and bewitched by Ariel’s song) and Miranda (having seen no other men besides Prospero and Caliban) falling in love at first sight. In order to cement their relationship for his own purposes, Prospero imprisons Ferdinand. Prospero understands it’s all about the chase.

&gt;“Lest too light winning Make the prize light.”

Questions:

1) As Duke of Milan, Prospero was mostly interested in just studying his books. He left all affairs of the state up to his brother to conduct. In your opinion, was Antonio justified in taking over the dukedom from his brother? 

2) Do you think this scene was intended by Shakespeare to be commentary on Europe’s colonization efforts? 

3) So far, do you feel pity or disdain for Prospero? What about Caliban?

4) In what ways is Miranda used by the island’s inhabitants to shift the power balance?

5) Prospero essentially gave up his dukedom for his books. What would you give up for your books?"
bookclub,"Well, I fully admit that I haven't finished the reading and I'm unlikely to tonight; work has been super busy again. But I'm on page 15 right now and enjoying every moment of this book. Ignatius the most enjoyable and true character study I've ever read, next to maybe Holden Caulfield, in that there is a \*type\*, and you aren't really supposed to like him as much as you are supposed to like the portrayal, because we have all known people like this. Seeing life from his point of view is an absolute treat.

Somewhat famously, John Kennedy Toole committed suicide before he saw this book published, possibly due to his lack of success at finding it a publisher. His mother made the rounds at after his death, annoying publishers all until someone actually took a look at it and realized she wasn't just a grieving mother with an overinflated sense of her son's talent. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize. The Wikipedia page for [The Neon Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Neon_Bible), his other novel (not published until 1989, 20 years after his death!), has better details.

In lieu of writing anything of substance (oh god, he's infected me), I'm going to ask you... what are you getting out of this first section? How do you think Jones and Ignatius are going to intersect?

My copy of the novel describes Ignatius as a ""Don Quixote of the French Quarter"". Those of you who were with us for \*Don Quixote\* (or those who have read it), do you think Ignatius's utter lack of self-awareness is comparable to DQ's delusional brand of madness?

bookclub,"Hi everyone,

Not sure what happened and why we stopped having the Foundation discussions (April’s selection) but I would still really like to hear your opinions on it!

Overall, while it presented pretty interesting ideas, I was kind of let down by the quality of the text. I mean, every single remotely relevant character had to have a name, and a weird one at that too. I get it, it’s the future, we’re in space, but... In fact I think that reading them so often made the ‘name-giving’ a little cheap. Also, the descriptions of how ‘manly’ Mallow was felt so out of place - I’ve no problem with that but I didn’t think they had their place in a novel such as the Foundation. 

Not sure how relevant it is, but there was 1 (one) female character in the whole book. Do you think that was intentional or just a product of the times when the book was written? In any case it was a man’s world, a manly man’s world.

Onto more intelligent remarks, I felt that there was a comparison there between how the Soviet empire fell and how the Galactic one did (in spite of the fact that the book was released way before 1990/1). Similarly to the USSR, the weapons and the know-how was spread out thinly among its surviving republics.

I thought it was cool that they moved on from using religion as a way to control the masses to using trade. It’s actually a little crazy how relevant that is today - religion still plays a huge part in everyone’s lives but think of how much the “stuff” matters! Be it goods to eat or to wear or whatever. Countries simply cannot be self-sustaining but I think we’ve reached a point where the trade is no longer just about sustenance.. not sure if a valid point, but think of all the goods made in China, like clothing or plastics.

Anyway, that’s my short review. Very much looking forward to other opinions as I’m sure much of the small details went unnoticed during my read."
bookclub,"  In Act 1, Scene 1, we meet the namesake of the play. The tempest, which means violent storm, is bearing down on a ship carrying the King of Naples, the usurping Duke of Milan, and other lords. 

While the crew of the ship fights the seas, the lords come up from their cabins and quarrel with Boatswain. Insults are thrown back and forth such as: “incharitable dog,” “whoreson, insolent noisemaker”, and “wide-chapp’d rascal.” Gonzalo continues to insist that they couldn’t possibly drown because the Boatswain’s fate is clearly to be hanged.

&gt;“Stand fast, good fate, to his hanging! make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth little advantage!”

The ship can’t stand up to the storm and splits. The passengers prepare themselves for their demise.

&gt;“The wills above be done! but I would fain die dry death.”

And so ends the short and chaotic first scene. Already we have seen of one of the major themes in the play: the struggle over power. Many of the historical and modern interpretations of *The Tempest* revolve around these struggles. 

Shakespeare lived during Europe’s colonization of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. As we read further, the play addresses topics such as the master/slave relationship and land ownership.

Other favorite power struggles of the critics to analyze are the battles of art vs. humanity and nature vs. morality. 

Lastly, some critics believe the play is Shakespeare’s farewell to theatre. Even going so far as to say that Shakespeare wrote himself into the play as one of the characters… 

Questions:

1) What power struggles do you already see occurring in this short scene?

2) At the end of the scene, do you think Gonzalo is accepting the fate of drowning?

3) If you were on a sinking ship, what would your reaction be: screaming in panic like the Mariners, rushing to be with loved ones like the lords rush to the King, or philosophical pondering like Gonzalo?"

&amp;#x200B;

This section was quite short and fairly simple on the surface – Ponyets uses manipulation (read: blackmail) as well as knowledge of the religion that controls the lives of the people of Askone to sell nucleics and win political power for the Foundation. Because the scope of the section seems fairly narrow (confined to a single planet) compared to the grand sweeping events of the previous, I see this section as representative/a single instance of the many similar dealings and expansions that are occurring during this time period of the Foundation's initial growth. Despite the simplicity, there are definitely some interesting questions worth exploring:

* How does Ponyets as a main character weigh up against the ones we've seen previously such as Hari Seldon and Salvor Hardin? Do you find him to be likable?  
* To what extent was the Grand Master committed to his religion? He seems to be ready to cave on the principles that he swears by very explicitly when discussing punishments whenever the subject of gold comes up. In his position of power, religion seems to be simply a means of keeping control, but he only  gives the impression of true faith when it is convenient. Also, to what extent to the masses of Askone believe in this Ancestral religion and why are they any different on this front than the men in power? What's Asimov's argument here – religion as a means of subjugation?
* The Salvor Hardin quote referenced at the end of the section is ""Never let your sense of morals prevent you from doing what is right."" Do you buy this? Is it an honorable/ultimately good sentiment, or is it at its core flawed and unethical? If you find this to be flawed, how does this color our view of the Foundation (especially given the shady practices of this chapter)?

I'll have the next post up tomorrow - thanks for your patience."

 HAPPY VOTING!"
bookclub,"Hello Asimov Associates,

A whole lot of intense action went down in this section, and Part 3 was definitely my favorite so far. The plot here is largely driven by this same interchange between science and politics and hunger for power, but this time science strangely takes the form of religion, in which the priests trained by the Foundation have spiritual power and Hari Seldon is viewed as a prophet. Science and religion are often thought of as a dichotomy, but now they are one in the same, religion being the conduit to help people accept science.

&gt;""Treating the problem sociologically, it would seem that when the old Empire began to rot at the fringes, it could be considered that science, as science, had failed the outer worlds. To be reaccepted it would have to present itself in another guise—and it has done just that.""

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at the some of the dialogue and the plot development of this section, these functions of religion in society (which give insight into the ideas at the core of Asimov's narrative) jump out at me:

* Bork points out to Sermak that the religion that has developed on Anacreon is ""ethically fine"" and states the accepted fact that ""religion is one of the great civilizing influences of history"". Morality seems to ensured by the propagation of this religion which promotes good values.
* The religion confers absolute power upon those who it deifies. At first this is upon Lepold (and by extension Wienis) who hold power through divine right, with the religion preventing internal struggles and guaranteeing domestic peace. As Hardin's plan comes into place and he asserts his control, the absolute power shifts to him, symbolized by the radioactive aura that now appears over him (look at that, more light imagery).
* The religion has allowed for the Foundation to restore scientific advancements and increasing prosperity to these worlds, despite the fact of their beginning decay. However, the people remain largely in the dark to reality, with scientific illusions perpetrated by the priests (who still somehow continue to believe) and by Hardin and the Foundation itself. The priest coming to the Foundation for training in ""radioactive synthetics"" thinks that he is studying ""Holy Food"".

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, the people of Anacreon and the neighboring planets benefit from their acceptance (and cowering fear) of this Church of Science, and it seems to be for ""the greater good"" in the sense that the religion is necessary for the successful fulfillment of Seldon's Plan. The key question is: **Is this mass deception morally sound?** The dramatic ironies throughout the section are strong—we as the readers are given a behind the scenes look into how the illusion of the supernatural/divine is created, through nothing more than the taking advantage of their modern technology. **Is it ok for the billions of people on these worlds to be living a life where they are lied to and deceived at every turn, living under the false pretenses (""utter mummery"") that the religion provides, if it is for this ""greater good""?** This question seems to be at the heart of Asimov's complex depiction of religion within Part 3.

&amp;#x200B;

This book keeps getting better – looking forward to your thoughts."
bookclub," 

&gt;“‘That,’ replied Hardin, ‘is the interesting thing. The analysis was the most difficult of the three by all odds. When Holk, after two days of steady work, succeeded in eliminating meaningless statements, vague gibberish, useless qualifications—in short, all the goo and dribble—he found he had nothing left. Everything canceled out.”

&amp;#x200B;

Hello Foundation Fellows,

The way I see it, the novel thus far is primarily leading us towards the big questions of What is the truth? and How do we get to it? In Part 2 of Foundation, we see two conflicting groups/ideologies that seem to get in the way of obtaining truth. There are the ""scientists"", who in creating their encyclopedia default to authority and ignore all pragmatic concerns outside of their sphere of knowledge preservation, as well as stagnating and failing to contribute any original research or thoughts of their own. And there is the realm of ""politics"", from the newly independent, insecure, and power seeking Anacreon whose only awareness is ""I have a gun and you haven't"", to the insufferable and condescending Lord Dorwin, who is empirically demonstrated (in the quote above) to be all flowery phrases with zero actual meaning.

&amp;#x200B;

These two worlds are consistently at odds, neither understanding the purpose of the other or willing to concede any ground. Pirenne emphatically states:

&gt;""If you’re proposing the militarization of the Foundation, I won’t hear a word of it. It would mark our open entrance into the field of politics. We, Mr. Mayor, are a scientific foundation and nothing else."" 

&amp;#x200B;

It was pointed out in the last discussion post that Gaal and Seldon in Part 1 were intentionally set up as foils, one blundering through Trantor and the other with all the answers, and in Part 2 we have an even clearer set of foils in the characters of Hardin and Pirenne. Hardin consistently serves as a convoy between the realms of stagnant abstract theory and real-world practical concerns, literally translating treaties and speeches into symbolic logic so that the Board of Trustees can finally process what is going on.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems that while Hardin is closest to understanding the underlying truth, having dabbled in psychology himself, the man with all of the answers here is clearly Hari Seldon. Hardin comes to the realization that:

&gt;""A great psychologist such as Seldon could unravel human emotions and human reactions sufficiently to be able to predict broadly the historical sweep of the future.""

It's still early in the book so it's hard to say for sure, but one possible answer for where the truth actually lies could be in studying human behavior itself — not weighing scholarly debates from centuries ago (no, Lord Dorwin, that's not what the scientific method is...) — but by analyzing trends and how the minds of people work in an almost mathematical sense, coming to unique conclusions about how interactions will play out.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, in the final chapter of Part 2, the big reveal of the Vault throws a wrench in this all, as the book raises questions about the nature of free will itself. Essentially, hologram Hari Seldon tells the group that their hand is now forced and their path is set for centuries to come, as the rest of the decisions they will make are inevitable (Seldon having controlled for all the variables at play up until that point). The residents of Terminus have no free will, and thus the truth here is predetermined for them, years and years in advance with seemingly no possibility for alteration.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this model that Foundation is presenting, in which all of us are simply machines that respond in fixed ways to the inputs around us and thus interact in a highly predictable fashion, a good reflection of reality?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm definitely looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this one. Until next time."
bookclub,"&gt;**“If you’re born in a cubicle and grow up in a corridor, and work in a cell, and vacation in a crowded sun-room, then coming up into the open with nothing but sky over you might just give you a nervous breakdown.“**

Hello Readers of Reddit,

I hope you enjoyed the first part of Foundation – it’s already a tale unfolding at a colossal scale.

A few interesting points and observations I thought I’d bring up based on the reading so far:

* Light as a Symbol – It seems to me that light in Trantor represents the rejection of ignorance and pursuance of knowledge and understanding. Trantor, the slowly falling capital city of the Galaxy, is located a mile underground and is covered by metal slabs that shield the city from the outside world, keeping the natural light out. The name of the hotel in which he meets Hari Seldon (grandmaster of knowledge in Trantor) is the *Lux*or, and people bask in “Sun Rooms“ that contain artificial light (the semblance of knowledge rather than the real thing) on their vacations. The quote I posted above reminded me of Plato’s Allegory of the Cave, with the forty billion people living underground being confined to darkness and ignorance, and when they leave the cave and see the light, their whole conception of reality is shattered.
* Psychohistory as a means of understanding human (and more accurately societal) behavior over time – it’s interesting to me that this field that seems very similar to a combination of our sociology, history, and economics is intensely mathematical, so much so that a PhD in mathematics seems to be required to grasp its formulations. There seems to be an emphasis on statistical trends within the field (looking at patterns of civilization as a whole), but at the same time Seldon uses the theory to predict with great accuracy the actions of Emperor Chen. I’m excited to see the theory be developed further as we read on.
* Gaal as a character has been depicted as bumbling and juvenile, as outsider to the world of Trantor looking upon it with childish awe. He has a ‘provincial accent’, he is called “my boy” and “kid” by the spaceship attendant after asking to watch the landing from space\*\*, and he is reprimanded for failing to tuck his feet under the bar in the elevator (“Can’t you read the sign?!”). I was thinking that the purpose of this could be to introduce us to this world from the perspective of an outsider, so we enter it with the same shock and wonder as he does. Interested in if anyone else has a different perspective.

\*\* The idea of mass transportation by spaceship as though it were a modern day airplane was pretty funny to me.

&amp;#x200B;

There’s plenty more to explore, but I’d like to open up the floor for discussion. A few questions worth thinking about that I’m interested to hear your answers to:

* What events, characters, or ideas brought up in the book so far do you see that mirror those in human history? Asimov took a lot from periods like the Roman Empire in creating this Galaxy, so what do you see emerging so far?
* What do you see as being the future of the Encyclopedia project and how do you predict this will play out? Seldon says at the end, “But as for me … I am finished.” What do you think he means by this?
* You are tasked with saving humanity from many millennia of suffering, foreseeing the impending fall of the Galactic Empire in say, three hundred years. Is there anything besides creating an encyclopedia to preserve the current state human knowledge that you would do to mitigate the disaster? 
* What else did you find interesting/funny/noteworthy in Part 1 so far? What questions do you have?

I look forward to hearing from you. See you in a few days for Part 2."
bookclub,"Hello Readers of Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

It is time to embark on a journey. A journey that reflects the scope of human history, being an epic saga that takes inspiration from the decline and fall of the Roman Empire. One that has set the course for the genre of science fiction since its publication (it was here that Asimov pioneered the concept of a “Galactic Empire”). It poses fascinating and sweeping questions about politics, religion, “psychohistory”, and the nature of civilization itself (yes, some deep discussions are sure to come in the next few weeks).

&amp;#x200B;

Welcome, friends, to *Foundation*, by Issac Asimov.

&amp;#x200B;

The book isn’t all that long (\~250 pages), but it is dense with ideas that we can unpack and closely examine in the comments together. The reading/post schedule for the next month is as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

[Friday, April 5 - Part 1 - The Psychohistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/b9zm7q/foundation_part_1_discussion/)

[Wednesday, April 10 - Part 2 - The Encyclopedists](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/bbvira/foundation_part_2_discussion/)

[Tuesday, April 16 - Part 3 - The Mayors](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/be3as9/foundation_part_3_discussion/)

[Saturday, April 20 - Part 4 - The Traders](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/bh3q7x/foundation_part_4_discussion_and_slight/)

Wednesday, April 24 - Part 5 (first half - Ch. 1-9) - The Merchant Princes

Tuesday, April 30 - Part 5 (to the end of the book) - The Merchant Princes continued (and a Final Discussion)

&amp;#x200B;

A few things to point out before we get started:

* As noted in the schedule, Foundation is divided into five parts, each of which can be treated as its own short story. However, the pieces come together masterfully to form the cohesive, imaginative, and classic novel we know it to be today.
* What makes this book so amazing are the ideas and concepts it presents—there is so much at stake and fundamental truths about humanity are explored. If you go into this novel expecting an action-packed plot or tremendous character development, you’ll be left wanting, but if you are ready to have your mind blown and to participate in some riveting discussions, hop on board.

· Benway is back at is with his obsession over gay men yet again.

· Everything was a dream? Or a sort of mind probe trance?

· Do I spy government sanctioned boyfriends? Is that, that what I am seeing here? I can’t really tell as Benway is the worst at explaining anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Have You Seen Pantopon Rose

· What is happening?

· There are definite urban fantasy elements in this chapter.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone else have the sense at this point that this world isn’t nearly as disjointed as it appears? It feels like we are traveling through time rather than space. There is definite cohesion and the whispers of world building."
bookclub,"So, given that my previous post was a bit of a flop, I invite you all to take a closer look at a specific short with me instead. Hopefully this will be a bit easier on all of us, as this book is proving to be a bit of a beast.

&amp;#x200B;

The Market

&amp;#x200B;

Enter a futuristic city where cultures blend one on top of the other, with a thick line between the haves and have nots. This world balances between vibrancy and decay, new life being built upon the ruins of a ravaged post war world. The people spend their time idly, looking for escape from the threats of their post nuclear Armageddon. They trade in any and everything; life, memory, slavery. The poorer echelons find escape from their suffering through drugs.

&amp;#x200B;

This city, even as it drowns in its own filth, is a bastion of hope for the ruined lands around it. People come far and wide for the chance to partake in the basic creature comforts offered here. The seas have belched plague, and even the land itself leaks radiation from the war. This hovel of a town is the best one could have, the rest of the world crumbling at the seams.

&amp;#x200B;

From here on we move to modern retellings of old tales, specifically of religious figures. These stories fit perfectly with the world in which they are being told. Of course the market, with drugs serving as a life blood for the city, would conceptualize enlightenment and miracles as, well, drugs and showmanship.  Jesus becomes a hustler and master showman. Buddha’s enlightenment is nothing more than a fierce high. Mohammed joins Jesus as more of a hustler than an enlightened fellow. None of this is particularly surprising from a disillusioned society that is ruled by commodity. Nothing is sacred anymore, even your body and mind can be divvied up and sold.

&amp;#x200B;

The world here is beautifully set up in the beginning. I feel like I am actually in this city, walking the dank streets and scurrying about with the citizens. So far the stories in naked lunch that paint a vivid picture like market are my favorites.

&amp;#x200B;

Burroughs is ahead of his time on this one. This story feels right at home with the current wave of post apocalyptic fiction. The dual themes of life must go on and everything is rotting into nothing are present. You get a clear sense of decay and debauchery, but also a strong pulse of life. People are still going about normal lives, no matter how rough it gets. The city is downright bustling, even as plague sets in and addiction runs rampant. The city groans and shrieks, but never buckles."

bookclub,"TRIGGER WARNING: Pedophilia  - Drugs

Hey guys. Sorry for the delay. I won't bore you with details, but instead, lets jump right into the text. I am going to keep my observations general so you can take it where you want. 

First off, the language Burroughs uses is amazing! 

&gt; Carl saw Joselito in a big clean room full of light, with private bath and concrete balcony. And nothing to talk about there in the cold empty room, water hyacinths growing in a yellow bowl and the China blue sky and drifting clouds, fear flickering in and out of his eyes. When he smiled the fear flew away in little pieces of light, lurked enigmatically in the high cool corners of the room. And what could I say feeling death around me, and the little broken images that come before sleep, there in the mind?

It brings together views of cold loneliness mixed with the warmth of yellows and the beauty of a clear sky. Such paradoxical visuals draw me into the story so much more. What is your favorite visual language Burroughs uses? What in particular do you like about it? 

&gt; The Sailor waited an hour before the creature picked up his presence.

&gt; “Any eggs for Fats?” he asked, his words stirring through the Reptile’s fan hairs.

&gt; It took two hours for the Reptile to raise three pink transparent fingers covered with black fuzz.

The way he described the passage of time here interested me. Any clues as to why he would choose to exaggerate the passage of time in this section? (NOTE: Not every version might have this section. I am using the restored version and am uncertain which chapters are included and which are not.)

It is during the ""Hospital"" section that we see William Lee's lust for young boys. I won't quote the section, and it is quite a bit difficult to read. I want to emphasize that this book was banned, not just for its pedophilia, but also the way it delved into homosexuality, human sexuality, and drugs overall. I want to ask: How do you feel about banning books with topics like these? ***Please, keep your answer hypothetical and considerate! Harassing replies, trolls, or overly political replies will be deleted promptly, and the posters will be banned!*** 

Dr. Benway is disturbed. This exchange disgusted me: 

&gt; Dr. Limpf shrugs and begins the incision. Dr. Ben-way washes the suction cup by swishing it around in the toilet-bowl….

&gt; NURSE: “Shouldn’t it be sterilized, doctor?”

&gt; DR. BENWAY: “Very likely but there’s no time.”

I just don't understand how he can treat another human that way. Then again, there is a lot of stuff I don't understand about this book. It's a trippy, drug-fueled adventure. I welcome any guidance you guys have. 

Also, that bit about The President confused me... President of what? And... what were they doing? 

What do you think about the 3rd party narrative in ""Lazarus Go Home,"" and how it suddenly switches to first person again at the end? Why do you think Burroughs did this? 

Looking forward to hearing from you. I will edit this post once I finish updating the schedule with a link. Take care. "
bookclub,"Hey guys. Due to personal issues, Naked Lunch is a check-in behind. As a result, I'm just going to move each check-in to the next scheduled day and tack on the last check-in to the end of the month. The new schedule is as follows:

bookclub,"Hello folks!

I realized recently that many people, myself included, would enjoy having a space to discuss literature on a deeper level than just appreciation but with a more laid-back attitude than some other popular literature subs. So I decided to make my own, r/literarydiscussion.

Please give it a sub if you like the idea! I'm hoping to bring this sub to life but I definitely need help to do it."
bookclub,I'm sorry I haven't gotten the latest Naked Lunch post up. A family emergency set me back a few days. I will have the post up tomorrow. I will also post an adjusted schedule at that time. Thank you for your understanding. 
bookclub,"Hey there! I am doing the first section of Naked Lunch. Fear not, I have mod approval.

&amp;#x200B;

Naked Lunch:

&amp;#x200B;

· The setting is oddly beautiful in it's own foul way. Very poetic\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

· Our friend The buyer had me first horrified and then laughing uncontrollably when he became an amoeba and 

absorbed his boss. Flame thrower was a wonderful touch

&amp;#x200B;

· I had a hard time telling the fever dreams from reality, anyone else?

&amp;#x200B;

Benway:

Oh Benway, what a wild read.

&amp;#x200B;

· Benway is quite the evil scientist, complete with exotic animal companion

&amp;#x200B;

· What a scary place to live, am I right?

&amp;#x200B;

· Apparently everyone is a little gay, so says the great Benway

&amp;#x200B;

· Complete pandemonium, with severed limbs and horror upon horrors, boring people insistent on revealing their entire medical history to random strangers (truly the real terror here)

&amp;#x200B;

· Ah, what a random STD pep talk just peppered in there.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall not really sure what I just read, but the ridiculousness of it all had me in stitches.

&amp;#x200B;

Naked lunch was the prettiest of the two, while Benway had me equally terrified and dying of laughter. Benway was my favorite.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone else find it hilarious? Horrifying? Perhaps both? What do we think think of these peculiar little tales?

&amp;#x200B;

\*\* Naked Lunch in particular was poetic and beautiful for its symbolism. The constant use of insect and ghost imagery to describe the addicts sent a dual message.

&amp;#x200B;

On the side of the addicts themselves, the way they are described as losing their human features hits at the core of their habit. They are consuming parts of themselves in order to make room for the high. They become so dependent that they are left as shells as they chase after their next fix, slowly fading into specters.

&amp;#x200B;

One the side of society at large they are seen as nasty bugs to be callously crushed under heel. They are described as being gluttonous slugs hellbent on devouring everything. It is as if society is saying, you are not of us.

&amp;#x200B;

The ghostly descriptions of the addicts also shines a light on how society at large treats addicts. They have become ghosts, forgotten. They haunt the corners that society doesn't want, completely invisible.

&amp;#x200B;"
bookclub,"I was pleased+surprised Naked Lunch got chosen.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A few thoughts -- the rhetorical stance reminds me a bit of the voice in Marriage of Heaven

and Hell by William Blake.  A little google tells me I'm not the

first person to see parallels.  What I see is a claim to see thru

a polite veneer to a fundamental frightening reality.  Burroughs

vision is thoroughly dark and feels a bit put on, a tad overstated/oversold/self-important

while Blake I figure was a genuine seeker after truth.  I think Burroughs,

though, is a craft writer, and a genuine seeker after some kind of truth

in writing.  Like Patrick Fermor or John McPhee in tactics of the writing craft, by which I mean really good at sentences.

&amp;#x200B;

What I find powerful in beginning of NL is the voice, blobby gelatinous

insidious and dirty, cozening, leering.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not obvious to me that WSB had any interest in literature beyond

pulp stories.  Does anyone know if he ever wrote/spoke about other writers?

Seems he's more got a background in business machines (I know biographically

he did) than Shakespeare &amp; Whitman.

&amp;#x200B;

According to this: [https://en.qantara.de/content/william-s-borroughs-naked-lunch-american-literature-from-morocco](https://en.qantara.de/content/william-s-borroughs-naked-lunch-american-literature-from-morocco),  passages of the book are reworked by other writers, and the assembling was a team effort.  So if you hate it don't necessarily write off WSB.   I haven't read Cities of the Red Night, but a lot of people think that later stuff is good storytelling.

bookclub,"Dilsey says, “I’ve seed de first en de last. … I seed de beginnin, en now I sees de endin.” She’s been there since the Compson kids were children, maybe even longer. We see that she’s old and used up. She was there on the first night we knew the Compsons, and she’s here at the end—both the end of the book and the end of the Compsons.

Because they have lost their money and their future. The events that Caddy set in motion have come to a head, and the Compsons’ failure is complete. They consist of an old woman who expects to be dead soon, and a man of about 35 who isn’t interested in marrying or having children. They’ve gone from a prosperous family with land to a family with no money, picked at by Quentin the Elder and mostly destroyed by Jason, and now Quentin the Younger has delivered the killing blow by taking Jason’s secret hoard of cash.

1. Why does Caroline think Miss Quentin killed herself?
2. Did you notice that we haven’t gotten any in-depth description of the characters until now? When Benjy in particular appeared it felt like I saw him for the first time; he was a bit indistinct before.
3. When Jason, Caroline and Dilsey get into Quentin’s room, it’s described this way: “It was not a girl’s room. It was not anybody’s room….” It’s definitely not anyone’s room \*now\*, but it seems like it never was. Earlier in the book, this room is the sick room (the one Caddy refers to as “where we have the measles”). No one has personalized it for her, or helped her to personalize it. No one actually cares enough about Quentin to do so.
4. Also note, “On the floor lay a soiled undergarment of cheap silk a little too pink….” Where else have we seen soiled undergarments, and what did they represent?
5. Does anyone actually care about Quentin?
6. What is Benjy smelling when they leave for church?
7. What’s the significance of ending on Easter? And why is Dilsey so affected by the sermon?
8. At the end, Luster tries—literally—to turn left with Benjy, but Jason climbs aboard the carriage and hauls Queenie back toward her customary route. Is this symbolic, maybe?

Anything else? What did you think of the book? Is there anything you wanted to discuss that we never got to?

I am so, so happy I got to read this with you guys, and I hope you enjoyed yourselves as much as I did.

bookclub,"Sorry, guys, the past few days have been unexpectedly busy. I'll get that post up tomorrow."
bookclub,"Thank  to those who participated in reading One Hundred Years of Solitude. I'm sure I learned more from you than you did from me.

This is a post where the entire book as a whole can be discussed. There are many more themes that are addressed in this grand story, but these will probably be the two that stick with me most:

**Circularity of time:**

History constantly repeats itself in the Buendia narrative.

&gt;""...the history of the family was a machine with unavoidable repetitions, a turning wheel that would have gone on spilling into eternity were it not for the progressive and irremediable wearing of the axle.""

There are outside forces, for example Western imperialism, that serve to disrupt a simple everlasting repetition. Eventually the axle wears down to nothing, and the spinning ceases. This circularity disrupts the linear march of time, and instead makes it so past, present, and future are indistinguishable.

Many characters also engage in activities just to undo them: for example, Colonel Aureliano Buendia makes golden fishes just to melt them down, and Amaranta stitches and unstitches her shroud. These activities seem to allow the characters to endure the passage of time, but not embrace it. Indeed, the entire arc of the story involves the making of a town, and a family, for it only to be unmade into nothing at the end.

**Subjectivity of history and reality:**

Part of the charm of the novel is its loose association with literal reality. Marquez blends fact and fiction seamlessly and without stylistic changes. His writing style in the novel was inspired by how his grandmother told tales to him as a boy, melding the fantastical and the literal, all the while keeping a completely straight face. That he wanted to emulate his grandmother's storytelling style is perhaps why sexual scenes are depicted grotesquely--you might imagine your grandmother relaying them to you in such a way to keep you from participating in something similar.

This idea is explored within the story most notably after the people of Macondo are massacred. The truth of the event is all but erased from history because those with authority decided it did not serve them for it to be remembered. The government also has a constantly waxing and waning relationship with Colonel Aureliano Buendia--at times he is an enemy, at other times he deserves an honor, depending on the circumstances of the present moment.

The  was also appropriate for Latin America of that period: ""[caught between modernity and pre-industrialization](https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/solitude/themes/); torn by civil war, and ravaged by imperialism—where the experiences of people vary much more than they might in a more homogenous society. Magical realism conveys a reality that incorporates the magic that superstition and religion infuse into the world."""
bookclub,"We've reached the end! I'm planning to put up a separate post that discusses the entire book, while this post will focus on just these last two chapters.

* Amaranta Ursula and her husband, Gaston, return to Macondo from Europe. Her enthusiasm and plans are not reciprocated by either her husband or reality. There is nothing in Macondo for Gaston, and he busies himself trying to establish air mail service to the area. He perhaps allows himself to be called back to Europe to establish a business, clear that Amaranta wants to stay in the dying town.
* Aureliano falls in love with his beautiful aunt, and she eventually succumbs to him. Theirs is one of the only pure loves in the story. When Gaston learns of their relationship, he confirms that he will not be returning.
* The Catalonian bookstore owner leaves Macondo and eventually convinces Aureliano's four friends and to do the same. The Catalonian's former nostalgia for his homeland is replaced by a nostalgia of his life in Macondo, but this internal conflict drives him mad and he tells the friends to:

&gt;""...leave Macondo, that they forget everything he had taught them about the world and the human heart, that they shit on Horace, and that wherever they might be they always remember that the past was a lie, that memory has no return, that every spring gone by could never be recovered, and that the wildest and most tenacious love was an ephemeral truth in the end.""

* The isolated lovers Aureliano and Amaranta begin to suspect that they are related. Aureliano attempts to discover the truth in this, but doesn't push hard enough to upset the prevailing theory that he was found in a basket and therefore is not a Buendia. Content with this explanation, the two continue their affair and become pregnant. When the baby is born:

&gt;""Through her tears Amaranta Úrsula could see that he was one of those great Buendías, strong and willful like the José Arcadios, with the open and clairvoyant eyes of the Aurelianos, and predisposed to begin the race again from the beginning and cleanse it of its pernicious vices and solitary calling, for he was **the only one in a century who had been engendered with love.** “He’s a real cannibal.” she said. **“We’ll name him Rodrigo.”**

* Amaranta likes to refer to virile, strong men as cannibals in these chapters. While the baby seems strong, it has the tail of a pig. Without Ursula, who would have viewed it as a curse, the parents don't understand the significance of the tail. It would seems as though Amaranta might break the cyclical curse of the Buendia family by naming their child Rodrigo, but immediately after, Aureliano declares the boy's name to be, predictably, Aureliano. Amaranta hemorrhages and dies just after. Aureliano, grief stricken, forgets about the baby, who is swallowed up by the ants overrunning the house.
* Aureliano deciphers the parchments and realizes they contain the entire history of the Buendias up to his present moment. Once the parchments were completed, therefore, the destiny of the Buendias was preordained. As he reaches the present moment that foretells the end, Macondo, with all its former vitality and promise, collapses to be forgotten in history.

&gt;""...races condemned to one hundred years of solitude did not have a second opportunity on earth.""

bookclub,"In the second half of Jason’s section, he continues to be the absolute worst. He’s a terrible employee—he arrives late, lies about why he’s late back, leaves the store after Quentin, returns after far longer than Earl thought he’d be gone, is a complete jerk to the man responsible for paying him, and then vanishes again.

He also took a thousand dollars from his mother and instead of investing it in Earl’s business, a lie he maintains to her, he bought a car. Nice going, Jason. When he gets a letter from Maury about a business opportunity—it looks like Maury has the same business sense as Jason—he tells his mother she’ll be throwing her money away if she gives it to Maury, but the same thing happens when she helps Jason.

They’re both perpetual victims, but in different ways: Caroline seems to say things like “You’ll all be better off when I’m gone,"" with the aim of causing guilt and/or getting reassurance, which sort of works with Dilsey but not with Jason. (Yet she keeps trying!) Jason is just biting and hateful and he’s the only person who can do anything right, yet everyone keeps taking advantage. If not for them, he’d have Earl retired, he’d have Quentin behaving, he’d have the family solvent. It’s okay for him to slack off because he has important business to take care of, but if Job does it, or if Quentin cuts school or the servants don’t pull their weight, or the telegraph people can’t find him because he’s running all over town after his niece, it’s inexcusable.

At one point, Quentin and her beau play a trick on him; they park the beau’s truck half hidden, and when Jason gets out and trudges through the weeds after them, they double back and let the air out of his tires. He thinks they’re completely inept because *he* would have slashed them. He seems to operate under the assumption that everyone is as terrible as he is, always out to steal money, wasting time, running on a steady diet of spite.

Also, whoa, check out this part:

&gt; “…Let alone a woman that cant name the father of her own child.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Jason,” she says.
&gt; 
&gt; “All right,” I says. “I didn’t mean that. Of course not.”
&gt; 
&gt; “If I believed that were possible, after all my suffering.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Of course it’s not,” I says. “I didn’t mean it.”
&gt; 
&gt; “I hope that at least is spared me,” she says.
&gt; 
&gt; “Sure it is,” I says. “She’s too much like both of them to doubt that.”

Uh, do Jason and his mom think that Quentin (Mr.) is Miss Quentin’s father? Thoughts?

1. Job has an interesting observation: “Aint a man in dis town kin keep up wid you fer smartness. You fools a man whut so smart he cant even keep up wid hisself.” This is a callback to the title. Recall the Shakespeare quote: “A tale full of sound and fury, told by an idiot…” How can’t Jason keep up with himself? How is he fooling himself?

1. Jason’s car. Check out the car. It makes him sick, literally—his mother even comments on it—but he still uses it. He goes to Memphis in it to see his girlfriend, Lorraine; he begs off work to go chase Quentin. The money he used to buy it was even stolen. Is this maybe a symbol?

1. Near the end, Quentin blames Jason for everything she is. “If I’m bad, it’s because I had to be. You made me. I wish I was dead. I wish we were all dead.” Then she slams the door, lol. I definitely said similar things when I was 17, and despite the drama, they definitely had some truth to them. Quentin has it worse than I ever did. She’s been abandoned by her mother (Caddy’s intentions notwithstanding, it’s all the same to a baby), she’s been verbally and physically abused by her hateful uncle, her mother’s been demonized around her, she’s being *locked in her bedroom at night*, I mean… no wonder, right? How much responsibility do you think Jason has here for how Quentin turned out? Do you think she’s using him as an excuse to run wild, or would she actually be a good kid if she didn’t have Mr. Rage and Mrs. Overly Permissive raising her?

1. Caroline says that Quentin (Mr.) and Caddy were always conspiring against everyone else. Have you seen any evidence for this? And wow, she adds, “And then when her troubles began I knew that Quentin would feel that he had to do something just as bad.” She means that she thinks his suicide was him competing with Caddy’s promiscuity/pregnancy, and I think she’s wrong on this count, but is there some truth to what she says if you remove that context?

1. She observes that Quentin “could have controlled \[Caddy\].” Do you think that’s accurate?

1. What’s up with the pigeons? And later, the sparrows?

What did you notice? Again, there’s just so much more here than what I’ve mentioned…."
bookclub,"It's occurred to me that I've gotten us a bit off [the original schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/aamevd/evergreen_reading_schedule_one_hundred_years_of/). Let's plan to finish with the end of the book on Wednesday, which will be a bit longer read (\~40 pages in my edition) than the chapter-by-chapter we've been doing.

In chapter 18 we see the re-appearance and disappearance of a few characters from the house that is crumbling and slowly being conquered by nature. The house, and the family, seem to be fading fast.

* Aureliano continues deciphering Melquiades' parchments. It seems as though Melquiades is willing/able to hold off reaching the final stage of death until his manuscripts are translated--he must make sure his history is preserved before he can fully rest.
* The long-serving Santa Sofia de la Piedad just packs up and leaves.
* Fernanda dies and her son Jose Arcadio returns as a foppish fish out of water in humble Macondo, constantly thinking romantically of his aunt Amaranta. It turns out that he and Fernanda were mislead and the fantasies that each had of the other weren't true: Jose Arcadio quit his papal training shortly after moving to Rome and Fernanda did not leave him with any grand inheritance. I thought it was ironic that the supposedly most-pious character, Fernanda, built a relationship of lies with her son who, trying to please her, only pretended to be training in the seminary. I think Fernanda's character was symbolic for how Marquez viewed (disdained) the hypocrisy of organized religion.
* Jose Arcadio and Aureliano are initially at odds but later develop a friendship, and indeed, a love for one another.
* Jose Arcadio and Aureliano find Ursula's fortune hidden under the floor. Aureliano has no interest or use for it; Jose Arcadio spends it lavishly and becomes friendly (and uncomfortably intimate? I was getting a pedophilia vibe) with some children in town. After JA turns on them for their recklessness, they kill him and steal the fortune. Maybe my mind is in the gutter, but this seems overtly sexual to me:

&gt;""...the children had become tired and gone in a troop to the bedroom, where they tore down the curtains to dry themselves, and in the disorder they broke the rock crystal mirror into four pieces and destroyed the canopy of the bed in the tumult of lying down. When José Arcadio came back from the bathroom, he found them sleeping in a naked heap in the shipwrecked bedroom.""

* The one remaining son of Colonel Aureliano Buendia, briefly returns to the house looking for shelter and protection. Jose Arcadio and Aureliano refuse him, and once he is turned out, he is immediately caught and executed by his pursuers. It seems that, without Ursula, the house no longer can serve as a place of refuge.

We now have the last section coming up. I'm curious to see if the Buendia lineage persist in any meaningful way. When we were introduced to the 17 Aurelianos, I thought that the family would live on through them even if the Macondo Buendias fizzled out. But the 17 Aurelianos were all killed, so it seems that the two characters we have left, Aureliano (in Macondo) and Amaranta Ursula (in Europe), are truly isolated (unless I'm forgetting about some others). 

&amp;#x200B;

What else is worth discussing from this chapter?"

A lot of questions are answered here. After Caddy's ""fall"", the Compson family quickly dominos. She's abandoned by her husband when she has her child, whom she gives to her mother and Jason to raise. (I'm not clear whether Quentin is already dead when she names her daughter after him.) The job offer Jason had, to work with her fiancé at his bank, dries up, and he has to work as a store clerk. Quentin the Elder drowns himself. Jason Sr. dies not long after this (I think) and the family dwindles to Caroline, Jason, Benjy and Quentin the Younger.

Jason is really vicious. He pulls some really abusive crap, like:

* Taking Caddy's money, meant to reimburse him for the risk he's taking in letting her meet baby Quentin, and then driving past her at a gallop while holding the baby up to the window
* Stealing most of the money Caddy sends for teen Quentin to have
* Pocketing the checks Caddy sends as child support, then forging fake checks for Caroline to burn
* Just being absolutely horrible to everyone, Jesus, this guy is the worst

How do you think he got that way? Why does he hate Caddy so much, and why does he meet her in person every few months?

Do you think his mother's favoritism had any part in it? Notice her crying on him when he's a *teenager* and baby Quentin is brought to the house. She has a husband! Caddy and Quentin don't seem to be the only ones committing figurative incest, do they?

Why do you think Jason's story picks up where it does? We've seen nearly nothing of the family until his late teenage years, after Caddy's fall and Quentin's death.

How is Caddy portrayed in his section? It's interesting how this part is told from Jason's point of view, and he obviously has a low opinion of her, but she comes off as extremely sympathetic anyway (at least to me).

What's going on with Quentin the younger? Why does she need the $50? We've met her as a teenager before, in Benjy's section.

One last thing I wanted to point out is: when she's grabbed by Jason at breakfast, Quentin says she wants her mother (and I assume she means Caddy, who she knows sends her checks; she definitely doesn't run to Caroline). By Jason's account, she's never met her. What's going on there?

How do the other characters react to Jason? He's not nice to a single person, yet has very different relationships with all of them.

What did you notice about this section?"
bookclub,"Some notable events that occurred in Chapter 17:

* Aureliano reconciles with Petra Coates, and although they have neither youth or money, they are as happy as they've ever been. They come to accept and embrace the decline of their (and the town's) fortune:

&gt;""Both looked back then on the wild revelry, the gaudy wealth, and the unbridled fornication as an annoyance and they lamented that it had cost them so much of their lives to find the paradise of shared solitude.""

I think ""the paradise of shared solitude"" is such a beautiful description of a romantic relationship.

* Ursula is said to have to ""make a great effort to fulfill her promise to die when \[the rain\] cleared."" Indeed, she has intervals of improved health after the rains cease, but nonetheless continues to regress into her past, becoming like a ""fetus"", and eventually shrinks away into death. It's like her life has completed a full circle, symbolizing the circularity of the entire family's history.
* We see the deaths of a number of major characters: Rebeca, Jose Arcadio Segundo, and Aureliano Segundo. The brothers die at the same time become equivalent again in death, just as they were in birth, and their coffins are rather comically switched during the burial.
* Jose Arcadio Segundo develops a friendship with Meme's son Aureliano and teaches him about the true history of Macondo, including the massacre. Aureliano becomes one of the few that knows the truth anymore. He also becomes interested in translating Melquiades' parchments for posterity.
* Marquez comments on the fallibility and subjectivity of history:

&gt;""many years later, when Aureliano became part of the world, one would have thought that he was telling a hallucinated version, because it was radically opposed to the false one that historians had created and consecrated  in the schoolbooks.""

* Finally, there is a strange episode the senile Catholic priest convinces the people that the town has been plagued by a strange creature known as the ""wandering Jew,"" a creature that seems borne straight out of anti-Semitic tropes (cloven hooves, half man half beast). They catch and kill the creature, but nothing improves. This story seemed sort of ""classic Macondo"" to me.

**Why  Jorge Amado?**

I was looking at the [previous selections](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/wiki/previous) and noticed that a brazilian author/book  has never being choosen. i think it would be nice to spread cultural knowledge of Brasil beyond Samba, Carnaval, Rio de Janeiro, football (a.k.a. soccer) and, maybe, Paulo Coelho. In Brasil, Paulo Coelho it's not a thing at all as he seems to be in other places.

Jorge Amado (Itabuna, Bahia, 1912-Salvador, Bahia, 2001) is one of the greatest writer of Brasil, i don't know how to describe his style (when i was searching about him in English i saw one or two article that said he was the brazilian Dickens, but i've never read Dickens so i can't say anything about that), but he is known as a modernist writer and regionalist, he wrote about Bahia ,the state he was born. His regionalism is divided in two parts: first part is more political and social; the second is more about the beauty and the way his people live. ""Captains of the Sand"" is in the first part, but the two most famous books of him is in the second part (""Gabriela, Clove e Cinnamon"" and ""Dona Flor and her two husbands"").

&amp;#x200B;

**Why Captains of the Sands?**

Captains of the Sands (1937)  tells the story of the gang of orphans adolescents called Captains of the Sands that live in the sands of the beach. They steal, scam, etc to live. The book describes how they ended up in the streets, how the bad things they do impact them, how they try to leave this situation, the tension between them.  ([a waaaaay better summary of the book than mine, i wouldn't consider it a spoiler but the post describes an important part of the book. I myself would rather not know it if it was my first time, so if you wouldn't like to risk it  skip the third paragraph)](https://robpacker.wordpress.com/2011/05/22/jorge-amado%E2%80%99s-captains-of-the-sand-capitaes-da-areia/)

Amado brings up the tension and divergence of the brazilian society, portraiting a more complex Brasil to the world.

bookclub,"“The book takes place in the midst of an unspecified war. Some of the marooned characters are ordinary students, while others arrive as a musical choir under an established leader. With the exception of Sam and Eric and the choirboys, they appear never to have encountered each other before. The book portrays their descent into savagery; left to themselves on a paradisiacal island, far from modern civilization, the well-educated children regress to a primitive state.

“Golding wrote his book as a counterpoint to R.M. Ballantyne's youth novel The Coral Island (1858), and included specific references to it, such as the rescuing naval officer's description of the children's initial attempts at civilised cooperation as ""a jolly good show, like the Coral Island"". Golding's three central characters—Ralph, Piggy and Jack—have been interpreted as caricatures of Ballantyne's Coral Island protagonists.

“At an allegorical level, the central theme is the conflicting human impulses toward civilisation and social organisation—living by rules, peacefully and in harmony—and toward the will to power. Themes include the tension between groupthink and individuality, between rational and emotional reactions, and between morality and immorality. How these play out, and how different people feel the influences of these form a major subtext of Lord of the Flies. The name ""Lord of the Flies"" is a literal translation of Beelzebub, from 2 Kings 1:2–3, 6, 16.”

bookclub,"Sorry to have this up a day late. 

At the end of chapter 4:

&gt;It was stated later that when the military authorities obtained the agreement with the workers, they hastened to tell Mr. Brown and he not only accepted the new conditions but offered to pay for three days of public festivities to celebrate the end of the conflict. Except that when the military asked him on what date they could announce the signing of the agreement, he looked out the window at the sky crossed with lightning flashes and made a profound gesture of doubt.  
&gt;  
&gt;“When the rain stops,” he said. “As long as the rain lasts we’re suspending all activities.” It had not rained for three months and there had been a drought. But when Mr. Brown announced his decision a torrential downpour spread over the whole banana region.

After the banana massacre, it rained for nearly five years, virtually destroying Macondo. The imperialists not only enslaved then killed thousands, but ruined the town indirectly too. Now everything (the good and the bad) has been washed away, and Mr. Brown's promise to sign the workers' agreement once the rain stopped is meaningless.

Aureliano Segundo is one of the few who keeps his spirits high, but it's more because of his irrational belief that the rain will always be ending soon instead of just being his personality. He is stuck at home with Fernanda and the children, and makes some use of himself there. When he returns to Petra Coates, their animals have died and she rejects him back to Fernanda, who continues to suffer from an illness of the uterus--is this symbolic of her severed relationship with Meme? We haven't seen the last of Petra, however:

&gt;""...she had discovered a reflective and just rage with which she had sworn to restore the fortune squandered by her lover and then wiped out by the deluge.""

Fernanda finally snaps.

&gt;""Fernanda’s indignation also grew, until her eventual protests, her infrequent outbursts came forth in an uncontained, unchained torrent that begin one morning like the monotonous drone of a guitar and as the day advanced rose in pitch, richer and more splendid.""

Aureliano Segundo gets an earful and finally snaps himself, breaking everything of worth in the house. As the chapter closes, he digs all over the backyard, knowing that there is a fortune buried somewhere back there, but only Ursula knows where and she isn't telling anyone but the true owner. Of course, he is unable to find anything. Ursula, growing ever older and more senile, has predicted that her own death is imminent. Will we see the death of the matriarch soon?

&amp;#x200B;"
bookclub,"This is going up later than expected! Thanks for your patience. And if you’ve gotten this far, congratulations; Jason is next and Dilsey/Faulkner after him, and while there’s some jumping around to come, the most difficult bits are over.

In this section, we start out with Quentin, newly released from the kidnapping incident. He sinks into a memory almost immediately. It’s a summer night of the previous year, and Caddy is pregnant. He finds her lying half in the creek. This part has \*tons\* of sexual undertones. Notice it’s her lower half in the creek, notice that Quentin wants her to get out of the creek just like he did when they were children.

Caddy doesn’t know who exactly the father is, but her main squeeze is this Dalton Ames guy. Quentin asks, rather hopefully, if Ames raped her, and she holds Q’s hand to her chest and her throat so he can feel her heartbeat going hard; this is supposed to prove to him that she loves Ames and was a willing participant in everything.

Quentin doesn’t know what to do with all of this information. Caddy kind of pities him because he’s never been with a girl, and he lies to her and says he has. He’s crying. He tries to get her to agree to a suicide pact, but the language they use is very sexual in nature. A selection:

\&gt; no like this youll have to push it harder

\&gt; touch your hand to it

\&gt; …

\&gt; push it are you going to

\&gt; do you want me to

\&gt; yes push it

\&gt; touch your hand to it

\&gt; …

\&gt; but i couldnt stop

The moment is over and they get up. He drops the knife and has to look for it, and then they meet Dalton Ames briefly.

After “you cant make me theres a curse on us”, the story shifts without warning to a few days later, when Quentin finds Dalton Ames in a barbership and tries to get him to duel like in the movies. It obviously backfires. Dalton could be a giant dick, but he isn’t. I mean, he sort of is, he’s not taking responsibility for Caddy’s child which might be his, but he’s decent enough to mother-hen the 18-year-old kid who’s trying to drive him out of town (by sunset, lol).

Then we are back in the present (1910), where Quentin has taken a swing at Gerald in mid-flashback, and gotten his ass kicked. He convinces Shreve and Spoade to let him alone and catches a trolley home. He gets dressed nicely again and thinks about how he will \*not be\* in another quarter hour. It’s at this point that Quentin starts to degenerate into incoherence. In a wall of text, he remembers the conversation with his father, where he “confessed” to incest, and his father doesn’t believe him. 

He readies himself and goes out, and the narrative stops there.

…So. Huh. 

1. Why do you think Quentin asked if Caddy had been raped?

1. Do you think Caddy was serious when she told Quentin to push the knife into her throat?

1. The smell of honeysuckle is everywhere. Quentin used to like it, but now he doesn’t. It’s described a lot as thick, heady, overpowering. What does it represent? Quentin tells us exactly what he \*thinks\* it represents. Do you think that’s accurate?

1. Why does he tell his father he committed incest with Caddy? What else do you think he tells him, and what is his father’s advice?

1. Last, Quentin has given us a hundred hints that he’s about to kill himself, and Faulkner has given us several more. What are those hints? How has this been foreshadowed? How does he actually kill himself? (Hint: not with gasoline.)

What did you notice? I’ve barely even scratched the surface here."
bookclub,"Quentin’s day continues, and so does my work week, so today’s post is going to be brief. The bulk of what happens in this section surrounds the little Italian girl, whom Quentin calls “sister”, and how he tries to both abandon her and help her. Interspersed, we have mostly Caddy-centered memories. Caddy’s pregnant, it turns out, and she doesn’t know who the father is.

This is a huge problem for Quentin. Faulkner said in an interview that the Compsons live in the 1860s, or at least some of them do. The year this takes place, 1910, is not exactly a paragon of modernity—what Caddy did is still *extremely* scandalous—but Quentin takes it to a bit of an extreme.
Questions and points:

1. What is his solution to the problem? Why doesn’t Caddy want that? (This is also the story of what happened to Benjy’s pasture.)

1. Notice the reference to an earlier scene told from Benjy’s point of view, when he’s clutching at Caddy’s dress. How is Quentin’s perspective different, and what do you think happened there? What did Benjy know?

1. Check out the mud fight between Quentin and Caddy. This is around the same page that the boys are splashing Quentin and the little girl, and that’s not an accident.

1. Notice everyone talking about the little girl like she’s dirty. Spoade, Shreve, the boys. Quentin, however, sees her as pristine: the shiny tight pigtails, patent leather whatever. He’s pretty focused on this, while in his memories he’s smearing Caddy with mud and smacking her in the face.

1. Why do you think he laughs when Julio accuses him of stealing his sister?

1. Quentin describes the girl’s demeanor, many times, as secret. Who else talks about women like they’re mysteries?

1. Why do you think the boys turn on Quentin and the girl? 

1. Shreve seems more outraged than Quentin over the whole “kidnapping” affair. Why do you think that is?

What did you pick out about this section? Are you finding it easier to get along in Quentin’s POV now?"
bookclub,"A summary of this chapter's events:

* Fernanda takes a defeated Meme to a convent in the town she was originally from, banishing Meme from Macondo and the family forevermore. We learn she will never find solace in this new vocation- she will spend the rest of her days lonely, thinking of Mauricio. Her child (by Mauricio) is taken to Fernanda, who never acknowledges his parentage.
* Jose Arcadio (remember him?) gets fed up and starts organizing a banana workers union to strike for very simple demands (toilets, end exploitative practices, etc.). The government, in cahoots with the plantation owners, subverts them by sending in the army to get the work done. When the workers further sabotage the plantation, they are gathered into the town square under false pretenses and mowed down by the army, leaving thousands dead that they carry away on trains.
* No one in the town recognizes that the massacre has occurred--has the government's propaganda worked? Are they in shock/denial? Has everyone simply forgotten already? Only Jose Arcadio seems to remember the truth.
* Jose Arcadio confines himself to Melquiades' old room where, for some reason (Melquiades' magic?), the army literally can't see him. Where a rich, majestic history is contained, they only see a worthless and rundown room. JA spends the rest of his days tormented by the mass murder and in a diminishing state of sanity, studying Melquiades' old manuscripts.

Jose Arcadio's unexpected arc parallels Colonel Aureliano Buendia's: they fought for the working class, were ultimately defeated, and spent their days in the workroom of their childhood home. Meme circles back to where her mom was originally from, and now Fernanda has a new child to ruin. But not totally:

&gt;""José Arcadio Segundo reached the conclusion that Colonel Aureliano Buendía was nothing but a faker or an imbecile. He could not understand why he had needed so many words to explain what he felt in war because one was enough: fear.""

Western imperialism finally ""deal Macondo its fatal blow"" in this section. Marquez demonstrates in stark terms what the powerful (industry + government) are capable of doing to the relatively powerless. The Buendia lineage in Macondo seems certainly to be dwindling.

Fernanda communicates telepathically with doctors for an invisible disease. Is she actually suffering from something or is it psychological?"
bookclub,"Congratulations, you got through Benjy’s section! Let’s start with Quentin.

Quentin is Benjy’s opposite. He’s an unreliable narrator, too, but while Benjy reports exactly what happened, Quentin reports things that may or may not have happened, and seems to hide a lot even from himself. Note how he interrupts his own memories sometimes.

Think of Quentin’s thought patterns as not necessarily truthful, but things he might be imagining or repeating to himself. “Father I have committed incest” is directly contradicted by him saying he’s a virgin a little bit later (why couldn’t Caddy be the virgin, etc etc), for example. Some of what he thinks is like an imaginary shower conversation, or intrusive thoughts. It can be helpful to look to others’ reactions to know what’s real and what isn’t.

The first thing I want to talk about is Quentin’s relationship to time. Like Benjy, certain things send him into memories. What are those things? And how is his concept of time different from Benjy’s? He seems obsessed with it.

In fact, he seems obsessed with a lot of things, chief among them Caddy. Note how he relates to every woman as a sister, and gets outraged when Shreve talks about “little dirty sluts”. Quentin asks Shreve, “Did you ever have a sister?” Or, you can only talk that way about women because you haven’t had the experience of feeling protective over one.

And maybe there’s a little bit of discomfort there. Certainly Caddy isn’t a sparkling example of chastity! Remember close to the end of Benjy’s section when he’s clutching at her dress and crying and he doesn’t say why? I think Caddy has lost her virginity, which is suuuuuper important to at least two of the men in her family so far. What must Quentin be thinking when Shreve mentions “dirty little sluts”, knowing someone could be thinking of Caddy that way?

There is so much to discuss here, and I’ve been prattling on for ages. Here’s some questions:

1. Quentin has a southern code of honor and a southern philosophy that drives him. It informs his relationship with both blacks and whites at Harvard, and it’ll come up again later, when he meets some Italian immigrants. How is he keeping to that code? Do you think it has anything to do with Caddy?

1. What’s with the incest? Does he actually want to sex up his sister or does he just think that might have been better than losing her virginity to (I suspect) this Dalton Ames guy?

1. Does Caddy seem to appreciate his protectiveness?

1. This is a real question because I can’t figure it out, what’s with the black guy with the mule when the train stops? What happened there?

1. There is lots and lots of foreshadowing in this section that I hope will make sense later. Quentin isn’t going aimlessly about his day. Those of you who \*haven’t\* read the book before, are you getting a sense of what he’s doing? I completely missed it the first time.

1. Anything else you want to bring up? I’ve only scratched the surface.

For those who like Quentin, he’s also the narrator of the book \*Absalom, Absalom!\*, which I have been meaning to read for almost 20 years and haven’t yet gotten around to."
bookclub,"hello!!

my idea is to fix the schedule posts of the active readings to facilite to people late in the reading and started late, because after a while those posts are hardish to find. i just found out that in non-mobile they're fixed in the sidebar (although, the sound and the fury isn't), but to people (like me) that uses mainly the app they aren't very accessible.

furthermore, i think that the new discussions posts, hints and updates could be linked in the schedule posts. this way the discussions would be more organized and it would facilitate to people behind in the schedule (like me) or that want to find a past discussion. and how the posts related with that book would be centralized in one post it could be linked to the title of the book in previous selections.

i'm new to the r/bookclub and i saw that the book of the month is The Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner. a while ago i tried to read it but gave up, so i was reluctant to participate but i decide to try again a couple days ago. however, it's kind annoying (in the app) searching for the schedule, if it didn't happen any delay, hints, discussions (in the right order). so i think my suggestions could help me and a lot of readers.

bookclub,"Hey everyone, I figured if anyone knew the answer to this question They’d be here! Any good ideas for running an online book club. I have some peers that want to run one but we live fairly far apart. "
bookclub,"We push on!

This section focused on two characters: Meme and Amaranta. 

* Meme arrives back in Macondo
* Meme's conflict with her mother
* Amaranta's death
* Meme's lover, Mauricio Babilonia, is shot

**Meme**:

Meme returns to Macondo from her clavichord training. She is virtuosic on the instrument, and this allows her to make friends with some Americans in town. Meme, temperamentally more similar to her father, chokes under the strictness of her mother Fernanda and turns against her. She turns to alcohol, American friends, and her father to cope with her hatred. She also develops a secret romance with the persistent Mauricio Babilonia, a blue collar mechanic. He is so insistent that she falls for him that she finally succumbs despite her desire not to. Mauricio's presence always coincides with yellow butterflies. This was a clear callback to the yellow butterflies filled the town after the death of Jose Arcadio Buendia, and they were a bad omen from the start. It seems obvious that Fernanda directing a guard to shoot Mauricio will just push her and her Meme further apart.

**Amaranta** 

Bitter until her last days, Amaranta weaves a funeral shroud intended for Rebeca. Knowing she will die when it's completed, Amaranta later realizes she will die before her old foe. She is willing to take letters from the citizens of Macondo to the dead as an act of kindness. It is perhaps telling that the only act of kindness I can recall Amaranta performing involves communicating with the dead, not the alive. Urusula has never stopped loving Amaranta, though, and her death confines Ursula to bed.

What else from this section is worth discussing?

&amp;#x200B;"
bookclub,"Hey guys. I'm sorry I didn't post this a week ago, I've been pretty horribly ill. I'm getting better, so I figure I better get something up so you ask can at least post your final thoughts. 

So, what are your final thoughts? 

I think one of the biggest themes in this novel has been persistence. With persistence, optimism, and a bit of know-how, you can accomplish anything. While many of us will never be stranded on Mars alone (I hope...), we probably feel alone very often. I know I do. It sometimes seems like I'm on a different planet with minimum resources. But this book inspires me to look for unique approaches to complex problems. I may have to plant a garden fertilized with my own shit, but, damn it, something is going to grow! 

Point out other themes you saw or anything you want to talk about. Discuss the problems with the story itself, and the final scenes. Did you like the ending? (I did not. I felt it was too abrupt. Also, in my head, Mindy and Watney are totally married now.) 

Ok, go!"
bookclub,"Okay, so there’s a lot to unpack here. I have some specific discussion points to get us started.

1. Pockets! What’s with the pockets? Benjy can’t keep his hands in his pockets, and Jason can’t keep them out of his. Do you think that’s related?

1. Why did they change Benjy’s name from Maury?

1. Did you notice any other Christian references? Dilsey calls Caddy “Satan” when she pulls her out of the tree, and note how Luster torments Benjy, and how Benjy suffers. What does this mean?

1. Benjy is \*not\* perpetually childlike. As a grown man, he’s attracted to the schoolgirls and grabs one. After this incident, he’s castrated (which is what Luster was talking about near the end of the chapter — “Looking for them aint going to do no good. They’re gone”). Does that return him to innocence? What about Caddy, where is she on the innocence to experience spectrum?

1. It’s established that Benjy can smell sickness. What else does he smell?

1. How do he and Caddy grow apart? Do you think he notices that happening?

1. Why do you think that T.P. and Mr. Quentin got him drunk?

1. Someone pointed out Caddy’s symbolic dirty drawers. We see them again when she’s looking into Damuddy’s window, and then later in that same memory when Dilsey puts her to bed. Thoughts on these?

1. There are lots of other symbols here, like the fire, Caddy smelling like trees, sleeping in beds in innocent ways. Did you pick up on any?

1. How does Caddy’s scene in the swing with Charlie differ from Miss Quentin’s scene in the swing with her beau? They react to Benjy in very different ways, for example.

1. Last, what do you think happened in this family, and what impressions have you formed about each of the other children (Caddy, Mr. Quentin, and Jason)? It’s going to get a lot clearer later, but I’m really interested in the impressions people are forming.

Did you notice anything else? There is so much in this section. We’ll also circle back to it later as we absorb more from the other three sections.

If you found Benjy’s section hard, take heart! Quentin’s is easier, and we’ll start his on Saturday. :)"
bookclub,"For those of you still with it, I found this to be an entertaining chapter. We see the ingenuity and persistence of Ursula in coping with disability, the excesses of Aureliano Segundo and The Elephant, and finally, the death of Colonel Aureliano Buendia (who would have thought it would be like this--squalid, old, defeated--after reading the book's first sentence?). He passes away leaning on the same tree at which his father died.

Marquez also gives us some insight into the solitude of the members of the family: they never recovered after a traumatic event. For each of them, one sad thing spoiled the rest of their lives:

* Colonel Aureliano Buendia: the war, and then how Gerineldo Marquez mocks his renewed fervor in old age
* Rebeca: the death of Jose Arcadio
* Amaranta: her love, and loss, of Pietro Crespi
* Jose Arcadio Segunda: witnessing a man executed by the army

Am I missing others whose solitude was defined by a single event?

We also see Ursula as her most nostalgic, most reflective self in this section. She reflects on the passage of time. In many instances, the circularity of the family is also highlighted: the Colonel's death in the same place as his father; Ursula's ability to blindly navigate the house because of her family's invariant behavior; Meme's penchant for excess just like her father.

What else is worth discussing?"
bookclub,"This is only a summary thread; please post if you need clarification. I don’t have the book with me at work and may not be able to answer until tonight. Actual discussion should be saved for our discussion thread tonight. I have some things I want to point out and specific questions I want to ask, so hold your thoughts until then! Or make a new top-level post about it.:)

Here’s the summary:

We start back in the memory of Caddy and Quentin playing in the branch and splashing each other. Note that Benjy is referred to here as Maury. (There is also Uncle Maury, who is different.) They’re heading back to the house because dinner is ready.

Quick cut in from Luster, who’s still looking at his quarter.

Back to the memory of walking back to the house. I’m going to call this the Dirty Drawers memory.

Then with the cows, another memory. The world is doing lots of moving, things that should not be moving, and I’m purposely not describing what’s going on because I want to see how many people get it. There’s a wedding going on offscreen. The Quentin in this memory is the first, male Quentin.

Back to the Dirty Drawers memory. This goes on for quite awhile. Something is going on at the house that the kids haven’t been told about; Caroline (the mom) is crying. The kids manage to escape the house.

After the kids go out again, we switch scenes, this time to a later date with T.P., who’s out with Benjy and trying to keep him away from the house. Roskus says, “Taint no luck on this place,” which sends Benjy into another memory.

Roskus says the same thing, about no luck, and implies that Benjy is the sign of no luck. There’s a lot that’s said here that you may want to bookmark, because we’ll find out more about it later. Roskus says there’s been “two”, a reference to bad luck coming in threes.

The next memory is of Benjy as a teenager, two years later. There is now another Quentin, a baby girl. Something has happened; Roskus is relieved that it has because bad things comes in threes. I *think* they might hop to a different memory somewhere in here, because first Benjy is playing in the dirt and then he’s being put to bed. It doesn’t really matter, though. At this point, Luster is very young.

We switch to another memory of T.P. holding baby girl Quentin. I’m pretty sure they are watching Father’s body being taken away after he dies.

Back to Luster briefly.

Then back to the Dirty Drawers memory. We’ve met Frony as an adult, but here she’s a child. She tells the other kids that whatever’s going on at the house is a funeral. Benjy briefly remembers another funeral, likely Roskus’s (Luster says, “I might meet pappy down there. I seen him last night, waving his arms in the barn,” implying he’s a ghost). We cut back and forth for a little bit, discovering that the grandmother (Damuddy) has died, then move on to another death:

Father’s! He’s on his deathbed, and T.P. has to keep Benjy out of the house. Benjy smells the sickness and starts to freak out. It smells like Nancy did, who died around the same time. I suspect Nancy is a horse or a cow or something.

Luster cuts in briefly, then we go back to the Dirty Drawers memory, where Caddy and Frony are still arguing. Caddy decides she’s going to climb a tree up to the window to look into Damuddy’s room to prove Frony wrong.

Next is the wedding memory, but earlier in the evening.

Then we cut back into Dirty Drawers, then back into the wedding. Then back to Dirty Drawers. We go back and forth for a bit, and then there’s a portion where T.P. is talking and Caddy says, “They haven’t started because the band hasn’t come yet.” It isn’t marked, but this is a memory segue. Versh pushes Caddy up the tree and she looks into the window. He mentions Mr. Jason, who is the children’s father, and different from little kid Jason.

Back to the wedding. Benjy sees Caddy with flowers and her hair and wearing a veil, and starts to make noise. Eventually, Caddy appears.

This sends Benjy into another memory of Caddy trying to figure out why he’s upset. Jason (brother) sneers at her about her dress. Eventually Caddy figures out that Benjy is upset because she doesn’t smell like herself—she’s wearing perfume. She wipes it off and they give the bottle of perfume to Dilsey.

Another memory. Benjy is 13 in this one. Father and Mother are having an argument about Uncle Maury. Benjy is upset because he’s not allowed to sleep with Caddy anymore. She climbs into bed with him and stays until he’s asleep.

Back to Dirty Drawers. Dilsey appears and pulls Caddy out of the tree. Caddy says they’re not doing anything in the bedroom, they’re all just sitting in chairs.

We go back to Luster briefly.

Then we get a brief memory where Benjy is heading out in the dark. T.P. catches up with him. This is before the wedding.

We get a couple sentences from Luster, who’s now trying to keep Benjy away from Miss Quentin.

Back to T.P. and the dark.

Back to Luster briefly.

Then we hear what the deal is with the swing. Caddy is there with her fellow, Charlie, who’s an enormous jerk. She uses the fit Benjy has as a way to break free from Charlie.

Back into the present. Miss Quentin is NOT happy to see Benjy approach her and the man with the red tie. She stomps off to the house and Luster has a conversation with the red tie man, then goes to look for the quarter again.
Switch to another memory. We find out that after Caddy went away, Benjy keeps going down to the fence to meet her, like the time when he met her after school.

Then we go on to another memory. Benjy sees schoolgirls pass the gate, and he tries to talk to them. They cross the street to get away from him.

We switch, then, and find out that Benjy got out of the gate. This is later, before Father’s death but when Jason is an adult. Jason thinks they ought to send him to a facility in Jackson, which is the county seat.

Next is the memory of actually getting out. Benjy finds the gate open. The passing schoolgirls are talking about him. He opens the gate the rest of the way and grabs one of them, and scares them badly. I think he gets punched in the face or the stomach.

Back to the present and Luster. Luster tries to sell a golf ball to a golfer, who takes it from him, and Luster takes out his frustration on Benjy. Dilsey appears and she knows Luster’s been tormenting him.

Another memory. It sounds like Caddy has upset her mother. She’s little here, seven or eight. They’re talking about someone’s name being changed.

In the present, Dilsey gives Benjy his birthday cake and Luster keeps tormenting him.

There’s a brief memory where Caddy is crying in Benjy’s lap.

Back to the present, more nonsense from Luster.

We go back to Caddy, seven or eight, and find out that Benjy’s name used to be Maury (as mentioned before) and that it’s being changed. The reason given to Caddy is that Benjamin is Biblical and Maury isn’t.

Back to the present. Luster gets caught being a jerk to Benjy, who burns himself. Mother appears, whining about being disturbed. Luster takes him away and builds him a fire to look at.

Another memory around the time of the name change. This time it switches to the Dirty Drawer memory mid-sentence. Caddy thinks maybe her mother is sick.

We switch to a time when she is sick, and thinks she’s going to die. There are a bunch of memories here all intermingled, and I can’t really keep track of them. Mother complains to Caddy about her spoiling Benjy.

Another memory; they’re still small. Jason has cut up the dolls that Caddy made Benjy and she’s beating him up.

Adult Jason appears in the present scene. He’s not much nicer. He’s complaining that Benjy’s making noise and gives Luster a hard time about it.

I think we go back to Caddy and Benjy in the last scene with their mother, very briefly.

Then the present. Miss Quentin is being called to dinner.

Caddy tells Mr. Quentin, who’s maybe nine or so, that Jason cut up Benjy’s dolls. Quentin has been in a fight.

Back to the present. Miss Quentin arrives. Luster ask Jason for money and Jason doesn’t give it. He starts getting on Quentin about seeing the man in the red tie.

Back to the memory of the dolls. Father notices that Mr. Quentin has been in a fight and asks about it.

Very brief bit from when the kids were young.
Then to Caddy as a teenager. Something’s wrong. She’s upset, Benjy is upset. He’s pulling at her dress and crying, and she’s crying too.
Another memory, this time Versh commenting on Benjy’s name change. He keeps saying Benjy is going to be a “bluegum”, which is a black person with very dark skin.

Back to Caddy and Benjy both crying.

Back to the present. Jason and Miss Quentin are arguing.

Back to Versh commenting on Benjy’s name. He dries off before the fire (is he masturbating here? I can’t tell) and Caddy comes in to feed Benjy dinner.

Back to the present. Miss Quentin complains about Benjy and fights with Jason.

For the next little while, we switch back and forth between the present day and Caddy feeding Benjy while it rains outside.

Starting with, “We didn’t go to our room,” we’re back in the Dirty Drawers memory. The children are going to bed in the sick room, not their own room/s.

Back to the present day. Mother comes to kiss Benjy goodnight and make some passive aggressive comment about not having a water bottle.

We switch back to the kids getting dressed for bed.

Then back to Luster. Benjy gets undressed and looks “at himself” and gets upset, and Luster says, “They’re gone.” At this point he looks out the window and observes that Miss Quentin is going to sneak out, and she does, going down the same tree that Caddy climbed up 20-odd years earlier.

Back to Dirty Drawers. Father comes in and kisses the children. He asks Caddy if she’s going to take good care of Maury (Benjy) and she says yes. Benjy falls asleep."
bookclub,"Writing the summary for Part II took a very long time, and I need a break. I'll post that in the morning, but the discussion post will come when I'm home from work, in the evening PST."
bookclub,"Hi [r/bookclub](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub), 

I wanted to inform you of a new sub called [r/1000daysofpractice](https://www.reddit.com/r/1000daysofpractice) where you can keep track of a hobby or skill you are learning (or already doing), stay disciplined, and encourage others. 

We started out as a music-focused sub ^((basically to motivate myself to not quit the violin)), but we are trying to become a more diverse sub for everybody, so you can track your other interests as well, such as **reading!**

Basically, there's a daily thread where you can log your activity, a bot-counter that will update your flair as you post daily, and we are working on collecting resources related to each category on the sub.

If you ever had a hard time keeping on top of your reading, or want to stick to your goal of reading *x* books in a year, then we hope our sub can help you!

Thanks!"
bookclub,"**Since we've all probably finished the book by now, to those that have seen the movie, care to share your thoughts about the book in comparison to the film-adaptation of** ***The Martian***?

Here's my take:

I actually found myself appreciating the movie more after having read the book. I had first seen it when it was released several years ago, then watched it again a few days ago.

Now armed with the knowledge from the book, I could better understand the little details in the film, like when Watney (Matt Damon) needed to get the RTG to use as a heating source and as a way to create water from pure oxygen. It made the scene, where he gets blown back after creating a spark in the HAB, much more funny as I knew exactly what had happened. I had an understanding of the science behind the explosion. I also knew what the heck an RTG was.

The movie also did a good job in smoothing out some of my quibbles with the book, namely the lack of character depth for the Hermes crew. I was surprised at how closely the film stayed true to the book, even reusing a lot of the dialogue from the book. The screenplay by Drew Goddard made it all work.

For example, in the book, we don't really know Captain Lewis' personality. Her emotions are only briefly explored except for a scene where she is talking to her husband over a video connection. He surprises her with a pristine copy of a vintage Abba record and she's smiles back in joy. This didn't quite work for me, as I thought the author, Andy Weir, simply used Lewis as a device to get some cheap laughs, a continuation of the disco joke. She felt like a prop here rather than a person.

Whereas in the film, they made the scene feel more powerful. It was inserted into a montage sequence using David Bowie's 1972 song, [""Starman""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRcPA7Fzebw). We see Watney on Mars preparing his rover for his trip to the MAV. This is interspersed with moments of the crew talking to their families back on Earth (as well as the Chinese and Americans launching the booster rocket). Here the 70s music by Bowie -- a continuation of Captain Lewis' love for 70s-era music -- is made poignant, emotional, and slightly surreal. The 70s music, and Lewis, isn't a simple one-note prop for humor.

Instead, by juxtaposing Bowie's classic 70's song against the backdrop of space and Mars, it gives this entire montage sequence an element of nostalgia, sense of wonder, and hope (they finally have a good plan to save Watney!). Up until now, there's been a tension in the movie about Watney's survival, so these moments where you see the Hermes crew relax and laugh also allowed the audience to relax as well (and relax to the soothing sounds of the 70s, just like Lewis normally likes to do, and grudgingly also Watney).

(I don't speak German but [here's the German-language version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeDllUiq92I) of this montage sequence from the film -- you can still get the overall gist of the scene if you need a reminder of it).

I thought the crew interaction overall was just better handled in the film. The actors did a great job, like Jessica Chastain (as Cpt. Lewis),  [Michael Peña](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pe%C3%B1a) (as Martinez) , Kate Mara (as Johannsen). Mara did a really good job in a very limited role. She made her romance with Beck more believable. There's that moment when she breaks her professional demeanor to kiss Beck on his helmet, before they attempt their crazy plan of blowing the airlock door to gain more ship thrust so they can pick up Watney. This moment is depicted both in the book and film, but it felt less heavy-handed in the film.

Again, I think Goddard did a great job of adapting the novel. He had previously worked with Joss Whedon, who is a master at dialogue and characterization. Whedon created the TV shows who are known for their witty banter, like *Firefly*, *Buffy the Vampire Killer*, and *Angel*. He also directed some of the Marvel *Avengers* films. Drew Goddard directed the cult classic *Cabin in the Woods (go watch it!)*, and created Netflix's *Daredevil* show, etc.

Also I'm a fan of director Ridley Scott so the visual storytelling, cinematography and editing was really well done.  He is really comfortable when dealing with the space genre.

I also liked the ending of the movie better than the book. In the movie, Watney passes his knowledge to students and you see the fates of the rest of the characters. They are either back with their families or helping to prepare the launch of the next Ares mission to Mars.

This ending provided more closure and a sense of continued hope. It wasn't all about Watney surviving, but about how a whole group of people (and nations) can continue on, keeping their dream of exploring space alive.  If Watney had died, a part of that dream may have died too.

Again, though, it's only by reading the book, that I was able to get this deeper appreciation of the movie. The book goes into way more detail about the Mars landscape and the science that Watney employed, so I did enjoy it for those aspects.

**So what did you think of the movie?**

**Was there any particular thing you thought the book or movie did better?**"
bookclub,"[Okay, so my summary with zero discussion questions is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/amirgn/april_7_1928_part_i_benjy_summary/) Check that out if you’re confused about events; if something’s unclear, ask about it here.

The neat thing about Benjy is that, unlike the other narrators we’re going to meet, he is guileless. He has opinions (boy does he ever), but he doesn’t lie about what happens, or have motives about the way in which he tells the story. The story is very much a thing that happens to him.

Some things for discussion:

1. Benjy’s relationships with the people around him. Who’s kind to him and who isn’t? Who treats him like a burden?

1. What makes Benjy cry and moan? For example, in the first two paragraphs of the book, what happens to trigger the crying that Luster comments on in the next sentence? Is there a pattern that you can pick out? Notice that people are often mistaken about why Benjy is crying.

1. Quentin is important here! This is our first introduction to him. Both he and Caddy have little-kid motives in the creek scene that are going to be important later on. What are those motives? What do you think of their relationship? There’s some symbolism going on here with Caddy’s muddy drawers, too.

1. It’s not mentioned this early in the book, but April 7th, 1928 is Holy Saturday, and it’s Benjy’s 33rd birthday. Do you think this is significant? Is Faulkner making some religious statement here?

1. Benjy mentions Caddy in the context of sleeping twice: “Caddy smelled like trees, and like when she says we were asleep.” Later, talking about the shadows that fall over the carriage, “…bright and fast and smooth, like when Caddy says we are going to sleep.” What’s going on with that, do you think?

1. We’ve briefly seen the mother. How would you describe her character? She seems to treat Benjy not as a person, but as both a baby and a punishment from God.

What else did you pick up on? There is \*so\* much, and there’ll be more once we start seeing how the Compsons’ lives play out."
bookclub,"Okay. BENJY. I am going to lock the comments on this one, too, and make a separate post for discussion. If you have questions, ask them there!

If you’ve read this and you can’t figure out WTF, you’re not alone! I didn’t get it the first time, either! To summarize:

Benjy, an intellectually disabled white man of 33, is clinging to the fence and hollering and moaning at some golfers who are hitting a ball. Luster, the young black man who’s minding him, is looking for a quarter he’s lost. Benjy snags his sweater going through a broken fence, and this dumps him into his first memory:

Him and his older sister Caddy. They aren’t very old. She’s unsnagged him from the same fence. She tells him to put his hands in his pockets because he def doesn’t want frozen hands on Christmas, and this sends him into another memory:

He’s being minded by Versh, another young black man. He desperately wants to go outside and is making distressed noises about it. Versh takes him outside, and we discover that he’s meeting an older Caddy, on her way home from school.

(Briefly, we return to the present, with Luster, who’s harping on him for moaning.)

Back to school-aged Caddy, who arrives home and convinces her mother and uncle to let her and Benjy go back outside immediately.

Back to Luster in the present-day. They pass the carriage, which kicks Benjy into yet another memory:

He’s going in the carriage with his mother, and T.P. is driving. Benjy is an adult in this memory. They are visiting the gravesites of his father and Quentin.

Back to Luster, who mentions the spotted pony that Benjy doesn’t have anymore. This sends him back into a previous memory:

He and very young Caddy going through the barn. We know this is the same memory because she’s still talking about pig killing and Christmas. She talks to him about riding the pony, but instead they deliver a letter from their Uncle Maury to a woman named Mrs. Patterson.

This dumps him into a later memory of when he was sent alone (presumably by Maury) with another letter. Mr. Patterson knows what’s up by this point, and it doesn’t end well.

Back to Luster and the present-day. Luster is still looking for his quarter. After a conversation with some friends, he sets Benjy to playing in the creek. This brings Benjy to another memory:

Caddy, their brother Quentin, their brother Jason, and the black servant kid Versh playing in the water."
bookclub,"Major developments:

* White/foreign settlers establish an adjacent community and a banana plantation
* The lethality of Remedios the Beauty and her eventual ascendance to heaven
* The new dictatorial police force and Colonel Aureliano Buendia's desire to restart the revolution

What was that sudden exit of Remedios all about? It didn't seem like she was ever really human. I'm puzzled about her character. Perhaps she was symbolic of the vice of temptation?

For some reason Macondo never really struck me as an ""indigenous"" community until this section. Now it has clearly been colonized, and within the first 20 pages all the associated evils have also appeared and are tearing the community apart.

What else is worth discussing from this section?"
bookclub,"I have to be honest, I fell off the wagon... I’m still on the same page as last wednesday so I have no idea what’s going on in the book. I am so sorry, but I have been so busy! I hope you still would like to discuss the book below, and if someone would like to take over as host, please send me a pm. If not, i’ll keep opening our discussions, but I am not sure if i’ll ever catch up again... :("
bookclub,"The first chapter has been a slow slog. I thought it would be nice to have a place to swap reading tips.

-Utilizing an online character list has been beneficial, since the characters are being introduced with such little context. 

-Treating the italicized portions like chapter sign posts helps break things up. 

-Not taking a break, to even look at the time, until the next italicized portion has helped me stay in Benji's stream of consciousness.
"
bookclub,"*The Sound and the Fury* opens with the most difficult section. We’ll discuss this part later on after we’ve actually read it, but I thought it would be helpful to include some hints before the discussion to make it easier. I am closing comments on this thread so people who want their experience spoiler-free aren’t left behind re: analysis and discussion.
Whichever way you choose to read it, don’t give up! Everything will become apparent! I promise!

**If you like going into a book blank, don’t read any further.**

1. This section is from Benjy Compson’s point of view. He has an intellectual disability (the crass and ableist among us would call him “retarded”) and doesn’t speak. His ability to differentiate past and present is somewhat suspect.

1. Benjy’s stream of consciousness pops in and out of memories somewhat unpredictably, so it can be difficult to understand what’s going on. Pay attention to the italics, and to who’s in the scene and how old they seem to be.

1. There are two Quentins. I don’t think Faulkner purposely made that confusing, but knowing it would have saved me a few confusing moments the first time I read the book.

1. Benjy often describes not his actions, but others’ reactions to them. Look for people saying “Hush, Benjy,” and the like. Also, watch for moments when he seems to be distressed. What are people saying and doing?

1. Last, there is a part immediately after the first scheduled section that I want to mention. When the cows run up the hill? Benjy describes a lot of things moving, like the barn and the cows and the ground, as though he is perfectly still. Read the section carefully and see if you can figure out what’s going on.

1. EDIT: Forgot to mention, he's referred to as Maury early in his life.

If you have questions, make a post and I and any other SatF veterans will do our best to answer them. Please make sure you mark your posts as containing spoilers if they concern part of the book we haven’t gotten to yet.

Good luck! You can do it! It only gets easier from here.
"
bookclub,"Ultimately, he made it. Before I go into that I just want to ask, how did you take the change of perspective from first person to third? What do you think Weir wanted to accomplish? Did he succeed? Overall, how'd you like it? 

Okay, quote:  

&gt; I got bounced around a lot, but I’m a well-honed machine in times of crisis. As soon as the rover toppled, I curled into a ball and cowered. That’s the kind of action hero I am.

&gt; It worked, too. ’Cause I’m not hurt

I'm kinda over the story. I feel like it's dragging at this point, even though something relatively chill just happened. Now, though could be because I have read the book before. I'm not sure. "
bookclub,"This is a hard one to break up, especially since I want to spend more time on the beginning, more stream-of-consciousness bits than the easier ending half. We are going to start slow with fewer than 20 pages of Benjy’s section on 2/2, and then set you loose on the rest of his section. We’ll speed up a little starting with Jason and Faulkner’s/Dilsey’s sections; there’s a lot to discuss there, but the writing is more straightforward. Because February is awkwardly short, you have extra time to finish Dilsey’s section, and we’ll discuss it all at once.

I will also make a post explaining Benjy a little bit, so those who don’t want to puzzle out the text for themselves can read it with less confusion. Look for that before 2/1.

* 2/2 - Beginning to “What is the matter with you, Luster said,” about page 18
* 2/6 “What is the matter with you, Luster said,” to the end of April 7th, 1928
* 2/9 - June 2, 1910 to “At last I couldn’t see the smoke stack,” around page 113 a little after a dialog section in italics
* 2/13 - “At last I couldn’t see the smoke stack” to “If that hamper is in the way, Mr MacKenzie,” just before lots of italics, around page 147
* 2/16 - “If that hamper is in the way, Mr MacKenzie,” to the end of June 2, 1910
* 2/20 - April 6, 1928 to the letter, “My dear young nephew,” around halfway through the section or about page 223
* 2/23 - The letter through the end of April 6, 1928
* 2/28 - April 8, 1928

I am so excited to discuss this book with you. I'll see you soon!"
bookclub,"Hey, everyone. I wanted to make a post about campaigns and how to help your nominated book get chosen. I think a lot of people noticed both my campaign post for *The Sound and the Fury* and then saw the book win.

**Campaign posts really work.**

I was skeptical, too, but last year I really wanted to read *Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell*, and so I went for it. Within an hour it shot up in the voting thread, and then continued to climb past the others for the remainder of the voting period. (I am a moderator, so I can see the votes as they happen.) People clicked on the campaign post, read my reasons for boosting this book, and went to the voting thread and voted for it. It's so easy it feels like cheating. Both times I've tried this, I was unopposed by any other campaign, and I'm hoping we can get some competition in here.

To that end, here are some tips from a post I wrote back in August:

1. **Nominate early.** The same day that the thread is posted, if possible. The earlier you get your nomination in, the more eyes will pass over it, and that’s more opportunity for people to vote for it. Don't let it stop you from nominating should you come in a day or two late, though, because there's a lot more you can do to give yourself an edge.

1. **Write a blurb about the novel in your nomination.** I’m guilty of not doing this unless I *really* want the book and assume people don’t know it. This is your first chance to build hype for it, though, and there are plenty of people checking us out who are not yet well-read or know what to expect from Thomas Hardy or Toni Morrison. A comment with a quick note saying that *To Kill a Mockingbird* was a coming-of-age about moral responsibility set in 1930s Alabama narrated by an 8-year-old would probably get more upvotes than a comment just listing the title and author.

1. **Write a campaign post.** We get relatively few people campaigning for nominations, but I saw *Jonathan Strange* soar ahead after I posted. I didn’t think it would have a big/any effect! Explain why you want us to read the book, what it’s about, what you think we could get out of it, and, most importantly, *post a link to the original voting thread and explain that’s where people should vote*. I failed to do this right off, and before I corrected it, I got something like 35 upvotes on the campaign post and maybe five on the actual comment that mattered.

1. **Don’t despair if your book doesn’t make it!** You can always renominate or read it on your own. I’m working my way through some failed nominations now.

Please check out [the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/wiki/faq#wiki_selection.2Fvoting) on selection/voting for more. (I see that they say that previous selections are okay; I think we need to update that part because they are only okay sometimes.)"
bookclub,"Hey guys. 

Okay, in Chapter 21 Watney starts packing. He gets everything into the trailer, checks it repeatedly, runs numerous tests, and then takes it on a test drive. Check, check, double check. Everything seems to be coming along well. 

Except we find out about an impending dust storm Watney has no idea exists and that NASA can't tell him about. The dust storm will inhibit his ability to fully charge the batteries, extending the length of his trip from ~45 sols to 225 sols. The Hermes can't wait and NASA can't even confirm if he's surviving because the dust storm will limit visibility to the surface. 

We also see The Hermes having struggles of their own. Things are breaking, wearing out. They are out of thick-gauge cable. Their reactors have been dialed back because the cooling vanes are tarnishing. None of this means anything to me, but it sounds *really* bad. The point is, there was meant to be an overhaul after each mission, and the Ares 3 mission is going a lot longer than intended without that overhaul. Also, it's out in the open that Beck is sleeping with Johanssen. 

On sol 449, after shutting down the Hab, Mark leaves for Schiaparelli. 

During Chapter 22, we watch as he heads toward the dust storm, completely unaware. We watch his successes in navigating, and his failure. And then we get to see him discovering the existence of the dust storm. He immediately starts problem solving. 

You know, I think that is what I like most about Watney. He's a problem solver. It gives me hope. With enough effort, I doubt I could survive on Mars, but I bet I can survive on Earth. We've got a lot more going for us here than he does. I think I need that positive message right now. 

Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow for Chapters [23-24](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/abfnaz/the_martian_schedule/)!"
bookclub,Hey! The votes are in and you chose *The Sound and the Fury* by William Faulkner! This title won by quite the margin. I hope to see a lot of participation in February! The schedule should be posted soon. 
bookclub,Hi! I was wondering if the reading selection for February's book club has been decided on yet. Thanks! 
bookclub,"Hey guys. I'm going through it, so I'm gonna just make this post easy for me and let you fill in the blanks. 

I think the book is great. I love that Watney no longer has NASA micromanaging him, and I bet he does as well. Even though it makes his life harder. 

Chapter 18 goes over what went wrong, making the rover mods, taking a *bath*, etc. 

Chapter 19 is back on Earth, the crew of Hermes talking to family, and NASA without with the Chinese. They successfully get their resupply, so at least Johannsen won't be eating anyone. 

Chapter 20 has us back on Mars. Watney finished the rover. He's getting ready to go. It's all coming to a head now. 

Ok, your turn. Talk lots."
bookclub,"I did it! I’m fully caught up with the reading schedule! :) 

The last parts are mainly about the war, and how over time, it is more and more without a purpose or cause. Does this relate to the cold war marquez was opposing??

Another development is that amaranta keeps rejecting men she seems to love. Does anyone have an idea why she is doing this?

This section ends with ursula threatening to kill jose arcadio... curious to see how this turns out!

I also noticed some things that I think are important, though I am not yet completely sure how/why:

-tying people down / depriving them from their freedom (a lot of people are tied down, jose sr, the boys who want to prevent themselves from going to pilar, etc)
-insomnia. Not only the disease, but it is mentioned other times as well.
- sense of reality (it is often mentioned as a value and a fear of losing it..)

Curious to hear your thoughts!

bookclub,"**NOTE: YOU HAVE TO VOTE IN THE [VOTING THREAD](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/ahekoa/february_voting_thread/), UPVOTING THIS POST DOES NOTHING.**

Hey, guys! I wanted to bring your attention to one of the books nominated this month:

**The Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner**

This is a notoriously dense and rewarding book. I would not have been able to make sense of on my own if I hadn't read it with my English class in my senior year of high school. It was my first introduction to books that could be *puzzles*, and was responsible for my love of complicated classics. That was... a long time ago, lol, but I've got the keys to this thing and I want to open some doors for you guys. This is one of the hardest Faulkner books, and if you can master it, you're all set for his other novels, which are deep and darkly funny, and many of them are puzzles of their own.

To quote *Macbeth*, it's a ""tale full of sound a fury, told by an idiot"" -- or, rather, three idiots: the intellectually challenged Benjy, his brother Quentin, and Faulkner himself, in a final third-person section, and all three of them together are the story of the love and hate of three brothers for their errant sister Caddy. There is *so* much to talk about here, from religious imagery to unreliable narrators, so much to decode, from Benjy's stream of consciousness to Jason's cruelty. I'm super excited just thinking about it.

If you're down for that in February, please vote for it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/ahekoa/february_voting_thread/). **YOU HAVE TO VOTE IN THAT THREAD TO HAVE ANY EFFECT.**

And if you disagree and really want something else -- maybe you like one of the other nominations, maybe you nominated something that you really want to win this month -- go ahead and make a campaign post of your own! I'll be sad if my choice doesn't win, but there's always next month.

EDIT: In the interest of full disclosure, there's lots of racism and ableism and sexism in this book. I'm hoping to address that, too! It's not a ""safe"" read if you like your books free of that sort of thing, though."
bookclub,"Yep, I'm a day behind. Sorry guys. I couldn't stop reading and forgot to post. &gt;.&lt; 

Oh well, let's catch up! We start Chapter 16 with Watney writing personal letters to the crew. The first one just broke my heart. 

&gt;It won't be easy talking to a couple about their dead son.

Yeah, wow. He just had to lead with that shit. Each letter he wrote pulled at my heartstrings. It just let me know how close the crew was.; They truly were a family. 

In the meantime, we see China trying to decide whether or not to help out by contributing their *Taiyang Shen* booster to the effort to help the stranded Martian. Turns out, China keeps their space mission incredibly secret, and they are unsure they want to share with NASA. However, there is a big draw. 

&gt;""Publicly rescue the Americans? Put a Chinese astronaut on Mars? Have the world see China as equal to the US in space? The State Council would sell their own *mothers* for that.""

Then we finally find out what Mr. Purnell was up to! The Rich Purnell Maneuver. This is where the Ares crew would go back and save Watney. 

&gt;They wouldn't intercept Earth at all, but would come close enough to use a gravity assist to adjust course. Around that time, they'd pick up a resupply probe with provisions for the extended trip. 

Of course, NASA decides against it. They'd need the only booster they've got left to try to get the supplies to the Ares 3 crew, and then still be risking 5 more lives instead of just Watney's. However, and I'm pretty happy this happened, ***someone*** gave the Ares 3 crew the info, and they adjusted the course themselves. 

Biggest thing that happens in Chapter 17 is Watney loses contact with Pathfinder, and as a result, Earth. He is, once again, on his own. 

Okay, your turn to talk about this book, these chapters, and where we are. Tell me everything! "
bookclub,"I listened to Anthony Heald's narration of crime and punishment a little while ago and greatly enjoyed it.  However, I would like to listen to a translating other than the one by Constance Garnett and cannot find one. I purchased a (print) copy of the P&amp;V translation to read when I have time. In the mean time anyone know of an audiobook edition I am missing? Thanks! "

 HAPPY VOTING!"
bookclub,"Well these were downright emotional chapters. We finally see Watney break, if only for a moment. I'm not going to say much about this because I just want to see what you have to say. 

First, the airlock explodes from the Hab, deflating the Hab and killing his crops, plus breaking the water reclamation system. He manages to get all of that fixed, but he's back to starving far too soon. 

So, NASA makes a plan to send a food supply, but they rush it and fail. 

Now, Watney is screwed and we leave Chapter 15 wondering if he survives. 

This was such an emotional section for me, in super glad we only did 2 chapters. I literally cried, even though I saw it coming, and I've read the book before. Jeez, right?

So, how did it make you feel? Did you expect this to happen? Any projections on how they fix it? 

Looking forward to hearing from you all."
bookclub,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

We have arrived at the end of chapter 6! Well, at least you have... I'm still in my reread in order to get more of the details, so I'm afraid I'm of not much use right now... I am catching up asap, but meanwhile: what do you think about the book so far? Do you notice central role of solitude in the development of the story? What other parts grabbed your attention?"
bookclub,"Hello! 

Okay, in this group of chapters we have NASA figuring out a way to talk to Watney regularly. The use Pathfinder, a rover left on Mars in the late '90s. We have Jack coming to speak to Venkat with the news that yes, there is a way, but he goes about it all complicated like. Their interaction made me laugh. In the end, Venkat offers to purchase autographed Star Trek memorabilia for the whole team, if it works. 

&gt;""I prefer *Star Wars*,"" he said, turning to leave. ""The original trilogy only, of course.""

And then the diet coke thing. LOL! I could feel the frustration. 

Of course, it would have been faster for Watney to receive the patch that allowed NASA to speak to him if it had been delivered through *Hermes*, but they were still refusing to tell the crew at that point. 

Once connected, Watney must deal with Nasa micromanaging every single thing he wants to do. This, of course, is frustrating. 

**Finally**, they agree to tell the crew. First, we get a play by play of that day. Then, we see their reaction: Joy, and the realization that they stranded him on Mars. Lewis is understandably crushed. Would you blame yourself here? I can't imagine not blaming myself, but I logically I can see she just did what she thought was best. IDK... What do you think? 

Chapter 13 was kind of intense. Each time they started to describe the Hab, I could tell something intense was coming. Did you feel that as well? Given, I've read it before, but I didn't remember him being thrown this way, his faceplate being broken, etc. He's just working away like it is nothing, and I'm thinking, ""How is he going to survive this???"" 

Of course, we won't get to find that out until Chapter 14. Give me your thoughts, etc. Which crew member do you identify with? I think I'm a Johanssen, but maybe that is because I hate waking up, lol. I'd also cry, for sure. "
bookclub,"Hi everyone, based on some of our readers' insights and reflections on our book, I am starting to realise that I am missing out on stuff. So I wanted to open this new discussion thread to talk with you all on how to read a book like 100yrs of solitude.

&amp;#x200B;

I already did some research, and amongst other things, I liked this [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlayYbfrHjo) that provides you with good starting points. Main points I got from this is:

\- try to find the theme of the story

\- look at the elements of the story characters, symbolism, plot, setting, imagery, and tone/mood

\- look for patterns/routines

\- look for changes in characters, settings, etc.

\- per scene, think about what it reveals about a character, setting, or the plot

&amp;#x200B;

Do you know other strategies? And, I'm curious to see how you make annotations in your book, do you use markers, pencils, a seperate notebook? 

&amp;#x200B;"
bookclub,"As you can read in the previous thread I created, I am realising that I am missing out on stuff because I am 'just reading' the story, but not really analysing it thoroughly. Even though I enjoyed it, I want to understand the literary aspect much better, so I decided to start over...

Today, I looked up a bunch of info on how you can actually conduct a literary analyses, so I am starting to understand how I should tackle this (though tips are still very much welcome! see also the previous thread). This does mean however that I will not be able to start today's discussion.

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to catch up as soon as possible, though I also want to take my time to properly engage in the re-read :) So, does anyone want to share his/her thoughts on this section? I do remember reading that Pilar became pregnant, again..."
bookclub,"Hey everyone! Let's jump right in. 

We start with a new conference outlining Watney's behavior. He's doing EVAs to prepare for a long trip, but no one on Earth can guess why, unless he is trying to make it to the Ares 4 site. This is something they do not want him to do. But finally, they figure it out. He's heading to Pathfinder. With Pathfinder's communication parts, he will be able to make contact with Earth again. During these three chapters, we get to see his journey and his successes. 

Some of my favorite parts here are the added emphasis on personalities. We see Mindy being meek, a sharp contrast to the bold Annie. We see Venkat being optimistic and intelligent. We see the official NASA psychologist tell everyone she thinks Watney could be ready to kill himself (That blew my mind! I wouldn't think she'd be allowed to say that.) 

Some of my favorite quotes here were:

The description of how dangerous the RTG is: 

&gt; As long as the container's intact, no danger at all. Even if it cracks open, he'll be okay if the pellets inside don't break. But if the pellets break, too, he's a dead man. 

Watney's plan to find Pathfinder:

&gt; ...so I came up with a brilliant plan that didn't work. 

and

&gt; Turns out you can't navigate by landmarks if you can't find any god damned landmarks. 

On being the first man to live on Mars: 

&gt; It's a strange feeling. Everywhere I go, I'm the first. Step outside the rover? First guy ever to be there! Climb a hill? First guy to climb that kill! Kick a rock? That rock hadn't moved in a million years! 

&gt;I'm the first guy to drive long-distance on Mars. The first guy to spend more than thirty-one sols on Mars. The first guy to grow crops on Mars. First, first, first!

&gt;I wasn't expecting to be the first at anything. [...] **I'm the first person to be alone on an entire planet.**

The quote above, I think, highlights Watney's personality nicely. How he's seeing things, and how the isolation is finally weighing on him. (Emphasis added). 

Okie doke. We know he gets it all working. Next time: We find out how Earth responds! Tell me your favorite parts, things that struck you, things you didn't like. 

See you on the [13th](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/abfnaz/the_martian_schedule/) for chapters 11-13!"
bookclub,"In our third read, a few new characters appear. We meet José the third (son of Pilar and José jr.) and Rebeca (a niece though no one is sure she is actually family) who sucks her thumb and eats dirt. At one point, the whole town is struck by insomnia disease (a solitary disease??) and this is cured by Melquiades (he resurrected from the dead because he could not bear the solitude). In addition, this section tells us about Aureliano, who seems to lead a solitair existence and can not find a girl. At the end of this section, we learn that he is starting to develop feelings for the 7 (!) year old mayor's daughter Remedios (spoiler alert: I read that incest is one of the main themes of this book...). In turn, Rebeca fell in love with Pietro Crespi, a guy who assembles pianofortes. However, he left the town and although they are writing each other, Rebeca feels solitary.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting to see the point /u/[Serpensortia06](https://www.reddit.com/user/Serpensortia06) already made in the beginning, which is that each character seems to face his/her own battle with solitude. 

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts so far? Did I miss any important things? 

&amp;#x200B;

By the way, I was also wondering how you read the book in order to grasp its meaning. Maybe you make specific notes or something like that?

&amp;#x200B;"
bookclub,"I see there is a monthly voting on what book is to be read collectively, and was wondering if it is acceptable to create another separate group reading.

For example, maybe each month there are three votings and so as a subscriber you have three selections to choose from for that month. 

...or... 

Is it acceptable to branch off within the sub and create an independent reading separate from the monthly selection? "
bookclub,"Hello, All! In these chapters, we get a few new characters and see Watney's plans unfold. It's still pretty sciency, but I think it was pretty understandable. 

Now, I want to stress that this book is supposed to take place in 2035. That means that what exists today, or when the book was published in 2011, would be far improved by this point. 

Okay, let's get into the summary. First, we meet Venkat Kapoor, the Director of Mars Operation. Immediately after we meet Teddy Sanders, the Administrator of NASA. It is 2 Earth months after Watney has been reported dead and left on Mars. Venkat has been requesting Mars satellite time for these two months. Apparently, there are 12 satellites in orbit around Mars and he would like to know if any of the materials from Ares 3 are salvageable so he can request an Ares 6 mission. (They are already funded for 5 Ares missions). Sanders has denied all of these requests on the off chance they would see Watney's body, but Venkat gets him to approve the request by saying they would tell the public Ares 6 could retrieve Watney's body for his family. 

Mindy Park is on the scene, 

&gt; ""Master's degree in mechanical engineering,"" she muttered, ""And I'm working in an all night photo booth."" 

and she is the one who determines Watney is alive. She can tell because the rover has moved and the solar panels are clean, and of course, she can't find his body. She calls in Venkat and the struggle begins to find a way to get him home. They get Annie Montrose, a foul-mouthed PR rep (it seems), to release a statement and suddenly everyone is clamoring to help get Watney home. It is determined they can't tell the rest of the crew of Ares 3 that Watney is alive. 

&gt; ""They have another ten months on their trip home,"" Teddy explained, ""Space travel is dangerous. They need to be alert and undistracted. They are sad that they lost a crewmate, but they'd be devastated if they found out they'd abandoned him alive.""

The next thing that made me laugh was Morris and Chuck's back and forth. They argue about a lot of stuff, but I guess that is how you come to a solution. 

&gt; ""I mean, come on!"" Morris said, ""What are the odds?""

&gt;Chuck turned to him. ""One in three, based on empirical data. That's pretty bad if you think about it."" 

Finally, we go back to Mars, and to Watney. He's trying to figure out how to get to the Ares 4 site. He determines it will take about 40 sols to arrive, and does some math to make sure he can make it. He also determines he can use the plutonium to heat the rover he's going to take so that he can get more drive time out of each battery. Watney dubs his rover missions the Sirius missions. For those of you who didn't get it, the rover can mean dog, Sirius is the dog, rover=sirius. 

One thing I can say is so far, I'm disappointed they haven't shown any decline in Watney's sanity. He's alone on a desolate planet! But I guess we'd only see what he wrote down, and maybe like we don't take photos of our bad times, he's not journaling when he's really low? I'm hoping we will get to see more as we move forward. He did finally acknowledge that being alone on this desolate planet, and away from the Hab, is hard for him. That was at least something. 

Okay, that's where I'm at. Tell me what you think so far! :) "
bookclub,"just subscribed. Can anyone give me a little info on how it works? I see that January's book is *The Martian* by Andy Weir, so a little late to the party one that one. When / how do you vote for February's book? TIA."
bookclub,"Hello! These first 5 chapters are really setting the scene. There is a lot of science and math happening here, but Weir does a great job of explaining it. I'm going to do a summary and hit the major points in the chapters. 

So, we start with Mark being left behind on Mars on ""Sol 6"". I want to explain what a ""Sol"" is. 24 hours + 39 minutes = a Mars day, according to Weir. Google says it is +37 minutes, but that doesn't matter to me. Apparently, there will be a few others inconsistencies as we go. 

Watney gets stuck on Mars because of a dust storm. Apparently, this is another inaccuracy in the book. Watney says the dust storm was moving at around 175 kph, which resulted in his team needing to abort their 31-day mission 6 days in. According to Dave Lavery, Program Executive for Solar System Exploration at NASA headquarters, that wouldn't matter. The atmosphere is so thin on Mars that 100mph wings would feel like 11mph. This dust storm was used only to move the plot along. NBD, still a good story. 

So, he gets stuck because of the dust storm. The wind breaks off the Hab relay, which tore off an antenna, which struck Watney in the side, puncturing his suit, bio-monitor, and side, but stopping at his pelvis. His crew left him behind assuming he had died. When Watney wakes up, he makes his way back to the Hab (I assume this means a habitat, but I don't think it is addressed), and stitches himself up. He realizes he was saved because the antenna made a seal and his blood sealed the cracks. He figures he is going to die soon and heads to bed. 

In Chapter 2, Watney is a lot more positive. After checking his resources he determines he can live for 400 days. Almost as an afterthought, he realizes he is a mechanical engineer and a botanist. He comes up with a plan to compost leftover foodstuff, save his poop, and grow foods like the potatoes that were sent for Thanksgiving. He later comes up with a plan to produce the water he needs for these 92 cubic meters of soil (368 liters of water). Now he will starve on Sol 490. 

Now, with the water problem, which almost gets Watney killed, we find another inaccuracy. Apparently where the Curiosity rover landed, 35 liters of water in a cubic foot of soil. This means he could have heated the soil and gotten the water. 

In Chapter 3, sol 25, He gets back to planning. Watney needs 1387 sols, or 1425 days, worth of food by Watney's calculation. This will get him to when the Ares 4 is scheduled arrival. So, he comes up with a plan to obtain oxygen from the atmosphere outside and hydrogen from the hydrazine used to propel the MAV. This required him to run the hydrazine slowly over an iridium catalyst, which would release the hydrogen. Then he would burn the hydrogen slowly. This led to my favorite qvuote so far. 

&gt;If you asked every engineer at NASA what the worst scenario for the Hab was, they'd all answer ""fire"". If you asked them what the result would be, they'd answer, ""death by fire."" 

I don't know why that cracks me up so much. 

Okay, so he does this, releases too much hydrogen and has to burn it off slowly. So he turns the temperature down to 1 degree celsius (around 33 degrees Fahrenheit), reduces the amount of oxygen in the room to 1%, and is ready to burn off the hydrogen slowly. Gives that ago and... 

&gt;Everything went great, right up until the explosion. 

Turns out he didn't take into account the oxygen he exhaled. Everything is okay, though, and he created a lot of water. He's dubbed Lewis' spacesuit ""The Cistern"". 

Okay, so that is a LOT longer than I planned. Now, I have a question: Every member of the team gets to bring some form of entertainment. What would you bring? "
bookclub,"We already achieved our second reading goal! 

&amp;#x200B;

In this section, we learn how Macondo was founded. José killed a man who made fun of him and Ursula (who are cousins, who saw that one coming...?). This killed man is the first ghost in the story, but more will follow. To escape this ghost, José, Ursula and some of José's friends with their wives and kids walked away. After many months, they decide to stay at a river in a place that is called Macondo. The sea was not yet found and José was convinced they never would.

&amp;#x200B;

In this section, we also learn that José junior starts a sexual relationship with Pilar. But, when Pilar got pregnant, José jr withdrew himself from any type of company (solitude!). One night, he visits the Gypsy fair and met a beautiful girl. Next, José jr runs away with the Gypsies. His mom Ursula tries to find him, but after five months of searching she still did not find him. What she did find, were other villages that were in connection with the great inventions. Did she also find the sea? We do not yet know...

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts on this section? Do you still like the book?

&amp;#x200B;"
bookclub,"Many people (including myself) are getting confused by the family names and relationships in the book. Our read runner for the book ([u/aclassicread](https://www.reddit.com/user/aclassicread)) pointed out that it's a good idea to keep track of the names and I can see why!

I found this chart online that does a wonderful job of doing this. Here's the link:

[https://birdinflight.com/infographics/relationships-in-one-hundred-years-of-solitude.html](https://birdinflight.com/infographics/relationships-in-one-hundred-years-of-solitude.html)

It's way better than the family tree chart inside my copy of the book.  This one is way more thorough, with more characters.

I also love the illustrations and the lines showing the different relationship types to each person.

Anyway, I hope that helps some of you, like it does for me."
bookclub,"First of all, happy new year! Second, I am super excited that we started this read. I could not resist to make a bullet journal spread about this read, in which I document my progress, some background info about the book, and along the way, I will add my notes and maybe some quotes. I cannot post the picture in this sub, but if you want, you can check it [here](https://www.instagram.com/aclassicread/)

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, now back to the content of our readings so far. I have to say, I really like the style of the book. It is definitely more readable than my previous classic (which was war and peace...). 

&amp;#x200B;

In the first chapter we are being introduced to quite a few members of the Buendía family, and I totally get why /u/[nautiketch](https://www.reddit.com/user/nautiketch) recommended to keep track of the characters and relationships. I am not yet sure how to do this though, as they all seemed to be called José... I did notice a difference in that the oldest José Arcadio is also called Buendía, and the younger one is only called José Arcadio, but when I peek into the family tree that is part of my book, that little trick will not survive for too long. So, do any of you have ideas about this?

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of the story, we mainly learned that José Arcadio Buendía was a man who tried to invent various things, but was not quite successful in doing so. He wanted to leave Macondo to find the sea, but his wife Ursula made sure they stayed in their hometown. The chapter ends with José experiencing ice for the first time (I read that Ice is an important symbol in this book, so I thought I'd mention that here too). 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think of the book so far? Any important symbols or other things I missed?

bookclub,"Hey Everyone! This is the schedule for January's read, *The Martian* by Andy Weir. 

I broke it into 10 check-ins over the month. I did try to keep it as even as possible, but it's not easy. I've read this book before, and it is fascinating. It'll be fun to go through it all with you! 

So: 

January 4: Chapters 1-5

January 7: Chapters 6-7

January 10: Chapters 8-10

January 13: Chapters 11-13

January 16: Chapters 14-15

January 19: Chapters 16-17

January 22: Chapters 18-20

January 25: Chapters 21-22

January 28: Chapters 23-24

January 31: Chapters 25-26

Based on my page numbers, this seems to be a pretty consistent reading schedule. I tried to give everyone enough days in between discussions, but remember: Now that this has been selected, the discussion is ALWAYS open! You can post about this novel at any time, not just in the discussion thread! Whether it is a quote you like, a science fact you know or want more information on, anything, *post away!* "
bookclub,"Wow. This book had me all over the place. 

In the final letters, we see Celie and Albert become friends as Shug is out traveling with Germaine. We see Celie's sadness, and her strength as she comes to accept herself as an individual. We see Albert propose formally, offering to become her husband in spirit in addition to legally. Celie declines, making it clear that she no longer hates him and would like to be his friend. She even teaches him to sew. Celie never believes Nettie is dead and some part of her always hopes Shug will return to her. In the final part, Shug returns home and decides to stop touring. Finally, Nettie returns as well, bringing her husband, Samuel, the children, and Adam's wife, Tashi, with her. They are a complete family, just as Celie always believed they would be. 

You know, I've been trying to figure out what to say about this book for most of the day. There are a lot of things I could mention, but I think the one aspect that was so meaningful to me was how Celie grew over the course of the story. From that scared 14-year-old, raped, pregnant, having her children stolen from her... all of it, to a self-sufficient, confident woman. It gives me hope... 

Tell me what you thought. What was most important to you? What made a difference to you, if anything? What didn't you like? 

Seriously, tell me everything, or anything, even if it's just one line. "

bookclub,"In the spirit of total transparency, I have not been following along with *The Color Purple* this month. There was no particular reason for this other than I didn't feel like it. 

I also generally don't like to post potentially politically charged content to Bookclub, but sometimes a current read hits the news during the month in a way that feels borderline irresponsible to ignore. I'm going to avoid making any value judgements in this post and try to stick to the facts.

Recently Walker was featured in the New York Times 'By The Book' feature.

In response to the question of which books were on her nightstand, a common standby in the feature, she included in her response

&gt; “And the Truth Shall Set You Free,” by David Icke. In Icke’s books there  is the whole of existence, on this planet and several others, to think  about. A curious person’s dream come true. 

This is passed entirely without commentary, but it didn't go without notice.

[David Icke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Icke) is a renowned anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist.

The Times has caught a lot of flak for this, but that's not of particular interest here.

[This on the other hand is.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/arts/alice-walker-david-icke-times.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FWalker%2C%20Alice&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection)

Faced with the criticism, she doubled down, and fully endorsed the book and the author, though denied that either was anti-Semitic. A defense that rings somewhat hollow in light of some of her own writing.

[It Is Our (Frightful) Duty to Study the Talmud](http://alicewalkersgarden.com/2017/11/it-is-our-frightful-duty-to-study-the-talmud/) (I don't usually go in for trigger warnings but, geez, from ""Are Goyim (us) meant . . ."" you might want steel yourself.)

I also learned that she has continuously refused to allow *The Color Purple* itself to be translated into Hebrew, which seems less like a protest against Israel than a straight condemnation of people who read Hebrew, but that's perhaps straying a bit too far into opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, that's a lot of set up for a few relatively simple questions:

Perhaps the defining artistic question of our times is whether art can be safely separated from the artist. In the past 'Death of the Author' was a prevalent and practicable philosophy in literary analysis, but as the age of digital and instantaneous mass communication has marched ever onward it has become next to impossible to maintain the separation that the 'Death' philosophy requires, as authors are able to continuously communicate with us outside the context of their books. Put simply, the author is very much alive and we couldn't kill them if we tried any longer.

In light of that, can we responsibly practice textual absolutist analysis as if instant and constant adjustment of context was the not the current reality?

Is it ethical to study Walker's work as if there was no chance that she was herself anti-Semitic, now or at the time of writing *The Color Purple,* for which she won both the Pulitzer and National Book Award?

Can the prestige of the book's notoriety and awards ever be mitigated by current knowledge, or does it have a shield against modern criticisms for having been considered a prestigious book in its own time? 

&amp;#x200B;

I recognize that these are not at all novel questions. If anything, they're being asked over and over again without any satisfactory answers because the circumstance arises again faster than we can actually process the last incident. By the time we can deal with Alice Walker, three more artists will be revealed to have enormous skeletons in their closets and we'll move on to them, and so forth again and again.

bookclub,"Hello!

You nominated and voted, and now the choice is clear! The Martian by Andy Weir. 

If you are interested in leading this read, okay notify the moderators! Otherwise, expect a schedule before the 1st! "
bookclub,"Okay, lots happening here. We start with Nettie admitting she's Adam and Olivia's Aunt and end with Celie inheriting a house. Everything in between is fair game! Anything after that, please wait until the final discussion on Saturday to discuss, or at least mark it with a [Spoilers] tag. 

I think the time that is sucking with me the most is how much naivety is lost as we grow. Nettie and Samuel become disillusioned with their missionary groups, as well so the Africans they so want to help, Celie loses faith in her god, the one constant in her life, Mr. ??? loses his views on women. Harpo learns his father is not always right. It goes on and on in this story, and this section. but it's not all bad. Celie thought she had no purpose, but now she has a business making pants. Pretty fucking cool. 

What themes have really stuck out to you so far?"
bookclub,"Hey! 

So a lot happens in these chapters, from Nettie living in Africa and writing to Celie about her day to day life, to Celie and Shug starting an official relationship. 

I'm not going to go over everything, so just tell me what you thought of what you read. "
bookclub,"Hey everyone. I'm sorry I missed Saturday's post. Today's post will be a combination of Saturday's post and today's scheduled post. 

Quick summary: 

First, Sophia gets herself into a proper mess. She refuses to kowtow to the mayor or his wife, which results in her fighting with them both, being beaten horribly and then thrown in jail. Mary Agnes tries to get Sophia moved because she is the niece of the Warden, but ends up getting raped. In the end, Sophia is moved and is forced to be a main to the mayor's wife, something she did not want to happen. She also becomes obsessed with death and murder. 

* I am struck by how horribly she is treated. Prison conditions today are pretty bad, but to be beaten, forced to care for horrible people, have children think they are entitled to kick you because you don't throw them a ball, to be raped for existing... these things are so disgusting. My stomach literally turned. And then she is forced to become a maid for the family that got her into this situation in the first place, and they continue to treat her like garbage (think when Miss Millie has Sophia teach her to drive after doing chores all day long. Then, she offers her a day off to be with her family, but after only 15 minutes forces her to return to work because she cannot reverse the car. Complete crap!)

During these chapters we see Shug and Celie becoming increasingly intimate with one another, eventually ending up having sex. All confusion is gone. It is clear Celie is in love with Shug and that Shug returns at least some of those feelings. Shug even says she doesn't feel the same for Albert (Mr. ???) because of the way he treats Celie. 

Due to this love, Shug is able to get Celie to open up about her past and her emotions. She is finally able to express all of the pain she has kept bottled up her entire life, especially regarding her sister. Speaking of her sister prompts Shug to look into the situation more. She realizes that Albert has been hiding the letters from Nettie. 

Shug works her charm on Albert and is able to retrieve a letter, and then the key to the trunk where the rest of the letters are kept. It is everything Celie can do not to confront and hurt her husband. Instead, Shug keeps her calm, cares for her throughout the difficult time, and is there as she reads her sister's letters. 

Nettie's letters are amazing and detailed. I loved reading them. I won't say more now because I am not 100% sure where the line is between sections, but if you have something to say, feel free to say it now. Just preface it with the word [Spoiler], please.

 HAPPY VOTING!"
bookclub,"""The Idiot""

This is a previous selection of Jul 2014.

I haven't completed the book, I am technically at 60% according to amazon, so if you can avoid spoilers, it's appreciated. I'm going to be very general myself.

I started reading this for the sake of putting another piece of classic lit under my belt, and I see The Idiot as being a highly respected novel. I thought it was quite easy reading at first, but the more I get into it, the more it seems like this book is not worth reading without some very deep reflection, and I'm not even sure if I'm qualified to have such thoughts :-)

So I recently I gave myself a task of reading a few chapters a day and it's getting even deeper still. I think the characters are clearly all representative of something either political, religious, or philosophical - and sometimes that jumps off the pages, and other times I am not sure if I'm getting it correctly.

I want to finish the book before having discussion on these types of symbolic details. But one question I have in the meantime is whether or not my assumptions about the symbolism in the characters is accurate? Or am I reading too deeply into things? I feel like I am seeing Christianity meet Communism, meet Capitalism, meet Nihilism, etc, etc.

I also have to rant about the use of names with the characters! I read that the name changes are commonly known Russian nicknames, but they are pretty confusing to keep up with because they often look nothing like the original name! In addition to that, there are characters who seem to evade my memory and suddenly pop back into action from time to time. If I had known all of this, I would have taken notes for each character from the beginning. Albeit I'm doing ok at keeping track of the main characters. But subtle things such as 3 sisters who all have Russian names - and all begin with an 'A' - and all with their nicknames I suppose... I tend to forget which is which and I wonder if I'm missing something intricate in their roles.

All that aside. I am really loving the story. A friend of mine started reading it too and found it boring. I personally love all of the subtle interaction between the characters. It seems quite realistic actually because they get crazed about things that people in real life actually get crazed about - not so much action, but still fascinating to watch the story unravel.

bookclub,"I DID IT! 🎉I finally finished war and peace! I tried to follow the sub’s schedule but fell completeley behind. What a struggle, I was at war and peace (and war again) with this book myself! I liked the parts about the nobility, but my gosh this book could use some editing. Is there a new classic piece of literature coming up?? "
bookclub,"Hey guys!

By following SparkNotes, I was better able to measure where we should be. In this section we get to meet Shug Avery and watch Celie explore her sexuality a little. 

When Shug arrives, she is very very ill. No one believes she will love long, except Celie. Celie is determined to heal the woman, and so she does. She cares for her so passionately that they become friends, even though everyone at church and all of Mr.'s family frowns on it. 

In addition, Sophia becomes fed up with Harpo trying to bully her and chooses to leave. She packs to the children and her stuff and heads to her sister's house. After 6 months, Harpo turns their home into a music joint and invites Shug to sing, bringing her out of convalescence. 

So, that's the summary. I know it's very simple, but that is because I want you to really expand on this section. I don't want to influence the start of the discussion too much. Really lay it on me. What did you think? Hope do you view the revelations thus far? Think about Celie's status at church and tell me about that. I want to know if all! "
bookclub,"Hey everyone, sorry I'm a day late. I honestly just forgot yesterday. I have set alarms on my phone, so it won't happen again. :) 

Now, let's talk about the story. 

My chapter numbers are off and I hate it, so forgive me if I am wrong about what is happening where. From what I can see, Chapter 21 ends with Mr. ???'s sister, Kate, is suggesting he buy Celie some clothes. 

During these chapters we see Celie move in with her new husband and learn to live with her step-children. At one point, she gets to see the child her father sold, Olivia. It is even confirmed that the child is hers when the woman she is with, the reverend's wife, says she calls her Olivia because she just looks like an Olivia. That bit broke my heart. 

Later, Nettie runs away from home. She comes to stay with Celie and is very helpful, however, because she does not pay Mr. ??? any attention, he kicks her out. Celie advises her to go to the Reverend's house seeking employment. Nettie leaves, promising to write, but never does. I keep wondering why she doesn't write, but I can't come up with a good reason. Even if she is incredibly busy, hasn't settled down, whatever... she could find time to write a simple letter saying she is safe. 

As I mentioned above, we end with Mr. ???'s sister's coming to visit. They praise Celie and Kate really seems to like her. They talk about Shug Avery for a while, and apparently Mr. ??? used to date her. I find this interesting since Celie is so in love with her. 

Alright, that's a quick recap. What are you thinking? What do you like so far? What do you hate? 

I'll see you all Tuesday with chapters (letters) 21-32. :) 

Edit: I have been notified that I ended too early, and I agree. So, talk freely through the part where Celie apologizes to Sophia about telling Harpo to beat her to make her behave. "
bookclub,"Trigger warning: this post will discuss child abuse and rape. 

Okay, those of you who have been with me before know I always post late at night PST. This read will be no different. 

Now, the book opens right into the abuse Celie suffers at the hand of her father and that is what this entire section centers around. Celie is used as her mother dies. Get father gets her pregnant, and she suspects he kills her child. Then she becomes pregnant again and she suspects he sells that child. 

Celie is forced to care for the household after her mother died, and her father raped her often. He also physically abused her. When he sets his sights on her little sister, she takes a beating to offer herself up instead. Nettie has an opportunity to marry a man from church, but her father refuses. He uses the excuse that he wants her to stay in school, to become a teacher, but it is clear Celie believes it's because he wants to rape her. 

My copy does not have the name of the man from church, Mr. ???, But eventually he agrees to marry Celie to take care of his household. 

It appears that was the end of this section as my book has it. 

I'm shocked by how simple the language is, and yet how compelling the story is. I'm completely drawn in by it all. It's beautifully done, and so disturbing. What do you think?  Tell me your thoughts. "
bookclub,"Hey guys. 

Let's start with a trigger warning: this book is graphic, talks plainly about child abuse, molestation, and physical abuse, and that was within the first 5 minutes of reading for me. I know this is going to be a challenge for me, so don't be shy about acknowledging that, even openly throughout the chat. Regardless, this month you are free to pm me, and we can talk. Also, if you are experiencing abuse in any form, please check out thehotline.org. They can help by giving you personal information for your situation. 

Next order of business: My copy is an e book, with no clear table of contents, so I'm getting my information from [this site](https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/purple/table-of-contents/). If my information is wrong, please correct me!

So, it looks like there are 90 ""letters"". SparkNotes has them broken into 8 sections. I don't know if those are chapters, or just SparkNotes sections, but I'm going to assume they are chapters. As such, we will have 8 check-ins. 

December 4: Chapters 1-10

December 8: Chapters 11-21

December 11: Chapters 22-33

December 15: Chapters 34-43

December 18: Chapters 44-60

December 22: Chapters 61-69

December 26: Chapters 70-82

December 29: Chapters 83-90

I hope that works for everyone. Let me know if I've got anything wrong. :-)"
bookclub,"If your interested in reading an older classic work of literature for December, [come on over](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicsBookClub/comments/a20btd/suggest_a_book_for_decembers_rclassicsbookclub/). "
bookclub,"Bit of a late post again from me on account of the holidays, sorry. I also had a death in the family so it is hard for me to keep my thoughts connected at the moment. 

So, what did everyone think? The novel definitely takes kind of a turn? Is the ending satisfying? It's hard for me to say, personally. the whole thing starts to feel like a metafictional exercise. 

Also, the various narrative threads...their interconnections are not always clear. But we do have connections between Childan, Frank Fink, and Mr. Tagomi.

Frank's authentic jewelry transports Tagomi to an alternative reality. Or rather, actual reality, since, as we learn at the end of the novel, the *I Ching* wrote *Grasshopper* because it is true. So there is a connection between authenticity and reality. 

One open question for me is: was Tagomi's gun authentic? He bought it from Childan's store, so we know it was likely a reproduction, but the possibility remains that some of Childan's antiques were genuine. It becomes imbued with a psychic meaning for Tagomi, a kind of meaning that is not in the object, only in his mind. This is exactly the kind of false authenticity which Wyndam-Matson had described - value lies in the mind of collectors, in certificates, not in the properties of the object. And we already know that Edfrank Jewelry is producing unique objects imbued with *wu*. I'm rambling a bit, but what I want to ask is this: what does the effectiveness of Tagomi's gun say about the gun itself? 

A lot of threads are left open in this novel. What will happen with Operation Dandelion? Frank has been picked up once by the SD, what's to keep it from happening again? What does it mean to say that *The Grasshopper lies Heavy* is true? Is everyone dreaming or mistaken? how can the Nazis have lost? And more importantly, how can everyone access reality, permanently?

I also want to highlight the brilliant writing during Juliana's panic attack. At least I thought it was brilliant, an accurate picture of the disjointed raving madness of anxiety and she was able to stave off Wegener though muscle memory and skill without even thinking.

In many ways, MIHC isn't an alternative history novel. alternative history is used as a vehicle to think about the nature of reality, authenticity, and the power of fiction to convey truths about the world.

bookclub,"Wow, well there's a lot going on in these chapters, isn't there? We really start pushing hard on the authenticity dialectic and value of objects. We also see a rapid development of Tagomi and Baynes' plot line, and the novel at times becomes a pulp spy thriller. It turns out Mr. Baynes isn't Swedish at all, but a German national, an Abwehr agent. (the Abwehr was the Nazi equivalent to our CIA, basically.) However, he appears to be working against the interests of the German government...perhaps a rogue element within the government? Is there a coup afoot?

We are also introduced to a new character, Hugo Reiss, the Reichs Consul. Chapter 8 is a little bit comic, with him trying to read a banned book while he is repeatedly interrupted. This scene is bookended, in our reading this week, with a scene in which he a bit humiliated by an SD officer. It turns out he has no authority whatsoever besides providing posters to people. But perhaps through dissimulation he can undermine the SD. And it is his patriotic duty to do so: 

&gt;I hate people who go over my head...it makes me too damn uncomfortable. It makes me so nervous I can't sleep, and when I can't sleep I can't do my job. So I owe it to Germany to correct this problem.

So what's up with Joe and Juliana? Anyone have any theories? It seems unlikely that Juliana and Frank will ever be reunited, given that Juliana is in Denver and Frank in S.F. and we have already read three-quarters of the book; what's the point of having Juliana and Frank be married? From a structural/story/writer's point of view?

And oh boy, authenticity/art/meaning/value/cultural appropriation time. It gets heavy here. Ed and Frank attempt to sell their *handwrought* wares to Robert Childan, and Robert figures he can fleece them, almost sees it as a joke. However, Robert does realise that *with these, there's no problem of authenticity.*  

Quite true. And in the spirit of authenticity the objects have not yet been subject to market forces or monetary value. Their value is only inherent. Robert doesn't buy them outright, but offers only to consign them. No money changes hands. They are as yet not commodities. Then Robert grafts an object to Paul for his wife, Betty. That is, he offers it as a gift. Again, the exchange is non-monetary. The object is not a market item. This is likely one of the reasons it is able to retain its *wu*.

And of course, Paul returns the object. It's a curious scene in the novel, isn't it? At first you think Paul is insulting him, then he speaks about *wu* that is inherent in the object, and it seems that Paul is appreciative...but then suggests that the objects just be mass-produced. Which would of course both eradicate *meaning* but also stand as a prime example of cultural appropriation.

Note that Paul's lecture on *wu* is to be read, I think, alongside Wyndam-Matson's lecture on authenticity earlier in the novel. Authenticity as a linguistic construct vs. authenticity as a value-in-itself, authenticity as artistic creation. Commodification eradicates the latter type--in fact, commodification is a version of the former type. The ""trashy good-luck charms"" only have value because of people's **beliefs** in magic and the like. Just in the same way that *this* zippo lighter has value because of a certificate, or belief in the certificate.

 HAPPY VOTING!"
bookclub,"First off, apologies for the late post. This is a very busy time of the year for me and I like to have something substantial to post. I hope everyone is loving the book!

There's a lot of meat in these chapters, especially regarding the authenticity theme I mentioned in my intro/schedule post. Mr. W-M seems like a wise sage of authenticity, pointing out that an object is really only authentic because of a piece of paper, a certificate, designating it as such. Authenticity is a linguistic construct, not inherent in the thing itself. 

Robert Childan also has some thoughts on authenticity while having dinner with the Kasouras, although he's thinking about culture, not objects. He also goes through a transformation, doesn't he? At the start of dinner, he's thinking of himself as an inferior being, but by the end he has regained his confidence. Why? He has had an epiphany about authenticity.

Frank Fink and his partner, Ed. They are starting their business now. And it has been revealed that Frank entered Childan's store in order to directly undermine his business. Fink and Childan are now both in the market of selling authenticity, but have competing notions. What are some of the cross-currents at play here? W.-M. has explained one of the major thematic tensions for us already.

And poor Mr. Tagomi with his panic attacks. What do you think he is afraid of?"
bookclub,"Hi,

There is potentally a lot to discuss even in just this short opening.

-Stress. Several characters seem stressed out-Robert Childan is stressed about his work and upsetting a powerful client. Frank Fink is stressed about losing his job. Nobusuke Tagomi is stressed about Mr. Baynes' motives, and pleasing him. This is a world where no one seems sure of their relationships to anyone, and the social rules are entirely unclear. 

-Narrative. As I hinted in the schedule post, a lot of the writing is a bit odd. I believe that the *entire* text is mediated by various points of view. We lose verbs and prepositions, quick shifts because that is how some of the characters think. We are always in someone's head. Did you notice a stylistic change in chapter three? 

-Childan, Frink, and Fink may represent three different ways of living under occupation. Do they perhaps represent something more as well? 

-Colonialism - conqueror/vanquished - how does it feel to read American culture through the lens of Japanese imperialists who perhaps don't understand the culture? What is Dick trying to do here? 

Fun fact: the *I Ching* figures prominently in the novel, and Dick claimed that he wrote *The Man in the High Castle* himself using it. So there's some wild metafictional stuff going on here, and trust me, it only get wilder. These chapters are an opening salvo; the weirdness is yet to come.

bookclub,"If so, would appreciate the invite. If no chatroom, can we start one?"
bookclub,"HI!

I'm excited to be the read-runner for next month's selection here at /r/bookclub: **The Man in the High Castle** by Philip K. Dick. This is one of my favourite works of his, although I've explored but a fraction of his total body of work. Anyway, this novel is not terribly long, so to stretch it out over a month ought to leave plenty of time for dissection and discussion. 

Here is the schedule:

Nov. 4th: Chapters 1-3

Nov. 11th: Chapters 4-7

Nov. 18th: Chapters 8-11

Nov. 25th: Chapters 12-15

Some initial questions and things to think about as you progress through the novel (I will be reposting some of these as we go):

1. PKD is often preoccupied, in his writing, with the nature of reality, and specifically, authenticity. As we move through the novel, you will notice the conflict between two notions of authenticity: the first is *historical authenticity*. That is, this such and such antique is authentic because it really was made back in the day, it really was used by so-and-so. It isn't a ""reproduction."" The second type is *authenticity of artistic creation*. Such and such object was created in some such way, or imbued with meaning by the act of creation itself. It is unique, not mass-produced (think original painting vs. a print). In many ways, **The Man in the High Castle** is about deciding which of these is 'true' authenticity, or which is superior.

2. You will notice very early that much of the writing, especially the interior monologues, is short, clipped, telegraphic. This will subtly shift based on character and perspective. Keep an eye out for how style shapes narrative and how different characters think.

That's all for now, happy reading! 

"
bookclub,"First, I have to apologize for the late start this evening: I had technical difficulties all day.

There's not a lot left to say about the story, so I'll refrain from going into details. Evil has been defeated, and the merry-go-round's control box has been smashed. The freaks have dispersed, and our heroes have survived.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll lead with a few broad questions about the text:

The pattern of the novel is one of a 'coming-of-age' story, but do the boys actually cross that barrier at all? In what ways have they grown older and closer to adult-hood, and what's the importance of the ways they don't?

The boys might trend towards adulthood, but in many ways Charles is as much a protagonist in the story as they are. What's the path his journey took?

The merry-go-round is a temptation even to the very last. What would the consequences of its use be, detached from the carnival?

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'd like to go off script and get real for a moment.

**The nature of evil, and how we defeat it.**

*Good to evil seems evil.*

Faced with the boy Dark, Charles makes the choice not to be cruel or violent towards the evil man turned child, but instead opts to combat evil with aggressive goodness. Without being overly political, I feel comfortable saying that it can feel these days things can feel awfully dark and dismal, and when we read literature that deals with the nature of fear and of evil, it is only natural to reflect on the fears and evils that exist in our lives, and our world.

More and more we see people from every side and faction become increasingly vitriolic and reactionary, each feeding off the miserable energy of their enemies and the noise of violence, hatred and intolerance becomes amplified with each exchange. Convinced of their own righteousness, people who claim to be good indulge in small cruelties and intolerances because they're so sure they're in the right that it doesn't matter how they behave. In *Something Wicked This Way Comes,* Ray Bradbury reminds us of another way. Goodness can be a weapon in itself, but it is mutually exclusive with the weapons of hate - the moment we indulge in petty attacks and hateful rhetoric we weaken our ability to use that goodness. We let the others who gladly revel in their hatreds know that same kind of hatred can be drawn out of us, that we're no different from them. 

&gt;""Will"" His father savagely jabbed a finger at him and at Jim. ""Damn it, Willy, all this, all these, Mr. Dark and his sort, they like crying, my God, they love tears! Jesus God, the more you bawl, the more they drink the salt off your chin. Wail and they suck your breath like cats. Get up! Get off your knees, damn it! Jump around! Whoop and holler! You hear! Shout, Will, sing, but most of all laugh, you got that, laugh!""

It's more than just tears that evil likes from us - it's rage, and bitterness and self-pity. We don't have to give it to them. We can choose in the face of hatred and evil to embrace the joy we do have. Nobody can be oppressed who does not in some part accept their oppression, so when you laugh and sing and play in the face of evil, you let it know that you do not take it seriously, it has no power over you. It can't hurt you with words and threats. You'll find that most evil has no real power but to make us feel afraid, until we give it more than that.

There will inevitably come times when evil grows too great to simply laugh at, and in those times it may become necessary to fight, but even then you do not fight evil by screaming, yelling, insulting, hating and crying. You fight with positive action, not spiteful words, and you do it always with a song and a smile in your heart, and a dream of brighter days ahead.

That, I believe, is the most important theme of this book, and one the greatest lessons Bradbury can still teach us.

&amp;#x200B;

**We are almost done friends! The long night is drawing to a close, and the dawn will start to break through. Let’s see what happens.**

Ch. 44

Charles is incapacitated by the pain in his crushed hand, and the Dust-Witch is now drawing near. Similarly to how Mr. Dark tracked the boys by their tears, the Witch seems to be attracted to his hurt and the pain in his hand. As the Witch begins to stop Charles’ heart, slowly slowly slowly, he decides to look one last time before sleeping forever.  He is struck suddenly by the hilarity of how her fingers look as she weaves her spell around him - almost like she’s tickling the air- and he begins to giggle.  The Witch recoils and tries to regain control, but Charles Halloway cannot control himself, and he explodes with laughter. His laughter is physically damaging to the Witch, and she retreats in pain and fights her way out the door. Charles forces himself to stop laughing as he realizes that he has won some sort of a victory but that much more still needs to be done, and with a smile on his face he runs out into the night.

Ch. 45-49

**(I’m going to slide this all together since I think the theme is more important than the play-by-play).**

The boys have no idea about Charles’ discovery, and are puppeted through town. They pass by the Cigar Shop Owner, and a policeman, but are unable to do anything other than what Mr. Dark tells them to do or say. Mr. Dark takes the boys to the Wax museum at the end of the Mirror Maze and leaves them there, awaiting their fate. Little do they know that Charles is following close behind!

The Carnival is full of people, and after storing the boys, Mr. Dark calls for the crowd’s attention to their final trick - The Bullet Catch. He introduces the Witch as the ""bullet-catcher."" She does not want to do the trick but he insists that it must continue. When she tells him that Charles Halloway is still alive, Mr. Dark becomes furious. Just like before with the boys, he pinches a tattoo of the Witch on his arm causing her to writhe in pain. He asks for a volunteer to fire the rifle and when no one offers to do so, he suggests that they should cancel the act. Just at that moment someone volunteers, to Mr. Dark's surprise. The crowd parts and the volunteer is none other than Charles Halloway. Mr. Dark attempts to not allow him to shoot since he only has one functioning hand, but Charles tells him that he simply needs his boy to be his strong left-hand. He begins to yell for Will, and encourages the crowd to shout with him.  Mr Dark is forced to eventually bring Will out, still under his control. The trick works by having the bullet marked with the shooters initials, but Charles decides instead to mark it with a crescent moon.After Mr. Dark loads it and gives him the rifle, Mr. Halloway opens up the gun, to show the crowd the bullet is still there. He knows it has been switched for a wax substitute that will dissolve on firing, but he simply carves the same sign into the new bullet. 

In an attempt to stop them from shooting straight, Mr. Dark tries squeezing his picture of Will, but each time, his father and the crowd calms Will down, their love and joy overpowering the pain and fear Mr. Dark is trying to exert over him. Just before he shoots, Charles mouths to the Witch that the mark on the bullet wasn’t the moon, but rather his own smile.

The Witch dies instantly as Charles fires the gun, and Mr. Dark yells to the crowd that she just fainted and the show is canceled.  The Witch’s spell is broken and Charles and Will run to the Mirror Maze to rescue Jim, who has left through another exit.  The Mirror Maze threatens to crush Charles as images of old men surround him, until Will forces him to face the images and tells him, 

*“Oh Dad, Dad, I don’t care how old you are, ever! I don’t care what, I don’t care anything! Oh, Dad,” he cried, weeping. ‘I love you!’.”* 

Mr. Halloway looks at himself and his son and the maze and laughs like he did with the Witch.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

In continuation to what u/VillainousInc discussed in our last discussion post, Bradbury is once again making a comment against the horror genre in general. Part of what makes horror so frightening is the inability to do anything against the thing terrorising you -the loss of control. Even in real life, things such as PTSD are characterized in part by it. ""(*In addition to witnessing or experiencing an event involving serious threat to one's life or physical integrity (Criterion A1), a traumatic stressor must also evoke an intensely negative emotional response (Criterion A2), operationalized as “intense fear, helplessness, or horror.”* \- DSM-V)  Helplessness in the face of horror/tragedy is a key component for Horror fiction. When we think about scary dreams people have had, or things in the news that evoke those feelings in us, it is often linked to a feeling of no control.

Bradbury directly refutes this in the next few chapters by showing us that the direct antidote to fear is laughter. That is because sad things happen in life, as do terrible things, and when we dwell on them it only makes us feel bad. But when we laugh it makes us feel better, and so when we can smile or laugh at difficult situations then we can heal ourselves. Things may be bad at the moment, but our laughter shows that we now they will get better eventually. If things never got better then we would not laugh.

The Witch, Mr. Dark and all of the Pandemonium Shadow Show seems to feed on negative feelings. The boys tears, Charles pain, and their collective fear is how they got caught in the first place.  Laughter however, like love, is something that evil denies. His laughing at her is a denial of her power over him and an affirmation of his strength as a human being. Without laughter, he would have given in to his hurt and his sadness but the laughter reminded Charles Halloway of better things, things that the evil of the Witch could never touch. 

Mark Twain once wrote that “*The Human race has one really effective weapon, and that is laughter*”. **Do you agree? Why or why not?**

**What are your thoughts on the idea of laughing at the darkness? How do love and laughter factor into our fear of the unknown or ‘the other’?** "

We are looking for a read runner or two, if anyone is willing. Please contact the mods! "
bookclub,"This week I won't burn time on the blow by blow, as it wouldn't serve very well. You all read the same pages I did. We're in the darkest moments of the story. The villain has won, the boys are under his power, Charles is in mortal danger, and there is little light or hope to be found, except - except! - that the story is not over. As long as there are pages left, there's a way forward.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, we'll look into a few specific things going on.

&amp;#x200B;

We left off on Saturday with Charles's decision to believe the boys and to help them, and a contemplation of the summer and autumn people. This continues in chapter 39.

*The very fact that we're here worrying about the difference between summer and autumn, makes me sure there's a way out.*

Let's begin here.

**A note on the purpose of horror.**

I've written a lot on this subject in my lifetime, and I won't linger long on this topic now, but I'd like to share a few thoughts that relate directly to the present novel. I love horror. It was not my first literary love or my last, but I fell hardest for it and though I don't revisit it as often as I might, it's still the genre of literature that most entangles my imagination. One reason for this might be a spiritual empathy - I have generalized anxiety disorder, with panic attacks, and in a sense I live with a constant barrage of potential terrors which nobody else seems to see or concern themselves with. The language of horror gave me ways to deal with it. It put faces to my personal bogeymen that were culturally meaningful.

I could write volumes on the decay of that meaning as the language and aesthetics of horror have been co-opted into less threatening forms, but I won't do that here.

In studying horror for my own purposes, I also found that horror was about more than just fear. Lots of things are scary, but what sets horror apart is the meaning of that fear, not just that the enemy is a monster but that true and unchanging evil exists in these works and that the essential element of escaping the settling darkness is moral fortitude. 

Neil Gaiman paraphrased G.K. Chesterton in *Coraline*:

 *Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons  exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.* 

The tools for beating those dragons are in the simple lessons of childhood. By being clever and prepared, a monster or witch can be beaten, but by being good, and following the rules, dangers can be avoided in the first place. 

Horror stories are the same as fairy tales, and the difference is one of the degree of subtlety in the morality play.

Even our simplest, most self-indulgent incarnation of horror - the 80s slasher flick - is generally a commentary on the primary moral issue of teenagers in that time, that of sex and promiscuity. In most vulgar terms: sluts die, the virgin lives. Most literary horror is more complex than that, and the sins being punished are more complicated or severe than getting frisky on the shores of Crystal Lake. In any case though, our own sins invite the greater Evil-with-a-capital-E into our lives.

**Charles**

Back to the story at hand, and with a promise that I'll get to the point of all of that, we see Charles take a guiding role, and a contemplative philosophical one here. We've see him in this hat before, of course, but this is robust, and hits at the essence of what this novel, and horror as I described it above, is all about.

*If men had wanted to stay bad forever, they could have*

Charles teaches us here that the basis of all human morality and ethics come down to the simple fact that we are mortal, that we know that one day we will die, and that our loved ones will die, and so will everyone else who will ever live. That knowledge is the essential characteristic that sets us apart from our primitive forebears. (Whether knowledge of mortality is uniquely human is a debate I won't indulge right now, but that is the belief espoused by Bradbury through Charles here.)

*Our hour is short, eternity is long.*

This much he tells the boys, but there's so much more he doesn't say out loud, and in that which Charles doesn't say, Bradbury builds his case.

*You start with little common causes.*

He defines love, not just romantic but that greater love we are meant to share with all our mortal brethren as the recognition of common cause, and that each of us builds this larger common cause by recognizing the small commonalities we share with each individual near to us. We share more experiences than set us apart, and if we find one essential common cause with anyone we differ from, then it is easier for us to be good towards them and others like them.

*You can't act if you don't know.*

Without the knowledge of our fellow man, we find it difficult to act in his favor. In psychology we're all aware of the Bystander Syndrome, in which in an emergency every member of a crowd determines individually that the crisis is somebody else's problem to deal with, or at least that surely someone else will deal with it. The problem goes unaddressed as everyone rests easy that the problem will be taken care of by someone who does care, or who is most qualified to deal with it.

**A stark contrast, or an appeal to reason?**

If I've been a bit preachy up to this point, I hope you'll bear with me. There's discussion here, I promise.

It starts here.

This philosophy of Bradbury's espoused through Charles stands apart from the main line of horror, and contrasts an essential element of the genre as described by modern horror's progenitor-in-chief H.P. Lovecraft. There's a lot to be said about Lovecraft, for good or ill, but what is essentially true and incontrovertible is that the genre as we understand it, and this book too, would not exist except for his influence.

In Lovecraft, and virtually all of what follows him, we find that the true enemy, and the sum force of Evil in the world, and everything we should fear exists in the principle of the Other. The Other is everything that is different than we are. For Lovecraft himself, this existed in his world as the influx of race into his very white world and he espoused this outside his fiction in the form of racialism, a principle that presages modern ""Nationalist"" movements. He felt everything would be fine if like would stick with like and the Other would keep to itself. On its surface this appears more civilized and intellectual than base racism, but time has shown these tendencies to result in hostile behavior almost inevitably.

This seed of prejudice built into the DNA of the genre has ever been a snake in the garden, and one that has proven exceptionally difficult to shake loose without also destroying the better nature of horror.

In his horror, Lovecraft shows this force as being faceless and incomprehensible, maddening to even look upon, and beyond the capability of reason and diplomacy. 

Is Bradbury's appeal to common cause a direct refute to Lovecraft? Does it beg a greater inclusion in the tribe?

Or is it all lip service to civility, while still making the Other terrifying?

**Horror, the Carnival, and making the Other**

Charles has theories about the Carnival itself, things he simply knows or thinks he knows or guesses. The essence comes down to their role in the morality play of this horror story.

The Carnival feeds upon the miseries, guilt and resentment of mankind, not the sins of deed as most horror villains, but the more insidious sins of thought and feeling which even the most virtuous among us might succumb to. 

It comes from Somewhere Else, always in October, and never so frequently that people might become accustomed to it, or remember its last arrival. Its proprietors are always strangers. Like the Devil in Faustian tales it comes with bargains with hidden drawbacks, and always what we wish for turns out to be something we can't stand to have.

Charles spends a fair bit of time musing on the freaks that travel with the circus, guessing at the vices which put them in that position. In essence the Carnival freak is the ultimate mortal incarnation of the Other, a traveling aberration who seems little like a good and normal person. But these freaks were all once neighbors and friends of someone somewhere. Who is responsible for making them Other? Did Dark do it by his evil ways? Did they themselves do it by their sins? Or is it Charles, by attributing imagined sins to them that make them responsible for their own Otherization, their own victimhood?

**It's always darkest . . .**

We've reached the climactic moments of the story. As I said earlier, I won't do the blow by blow here - it would only ruin the great virtue of the tension that is built in Bradbury's prose. Dark arrives, and despite Charles and the boys' best efforts, he comes out victorious. 

The boys are captured, their senses deadened by the Witch's sorcery - *darning-needle dragonfly* \- and Charles is defeated, his heart set to burst from his chest, in a simple heart-attack just as Dark had said, and with the threat of the Witch hanging over him.

*The janitor's clock. Stop it.*

Will Charles live? Will the boys escape? Who can possibly save any of them at this point?

&amp;#x200B;"
bookclub,"Ahh! Sorry this is so late today. Between a cold, no sleep and a cranky toddler, I totally forgot what day of the week it was.  Anyways, without further ado, let's jump in. 


Ch. 34

The scene in this chapter opens and reads almost akin to a movie. The camera starts at the Cigar store front, as off in the periphery the audience is made aware of a parade happening through sound first.  Bradbury describes the “Sunbright cymbals”, the “flourished drums”, and “the old-woman shriek of the calliope”and then through flashes, we catch glimpses of the parade..  The camera stays trained on the Cigar store front and it’s Wooden Indian, and then slowly pans down to the street, following the shadow of the statue’s hatchet.  It then focuses on a silver grate in the sidewalk. We see as hundreds of feet pass over the grate, dropping pennies, trash and other miscellaneous items as they walk by. The camera then zooms in even further, allowing us to notice two shadows huddled in the dark space beneath the grill.  It’s Will and Jim, hiding from the parade.

“Crouched knee to knee, heads up, eyes alert, they sucked their breaths like iron Popsicles.” Bradbury wants us to feel the tension they feel, watching person after person go overhead, and hoping that they pass unnoticed.  Jim asks Will what they are doing under there and suggests that they leave, but Will tells him no. They watch Charles go by, and Will thinks about calling out to him, but Charles hurries away before Will can give in to the temptation.

Suddenly a small boy drops his gum into the grate and begins to fish for it. At that moment, the parade stops its progress and begins to disperse into the crowd, handing out flyers, talking to onlookers, etc. The chapter ends with the little boy calling to his mother: “Look Ma! There!”

Augh! Such tension! Will the boys get noticed?

Ch. 35

The story now jumps to Charles, who is getting a cup of coffee at Ned’s when Mr. Dark sits down at the counter next to him. I love the way we are introduced to the idea that it’s Mr. Dark.  Bradbury is letting the tension build, and only gives us a small piece, which is so much more horrifying than just saying “The bell jingled as the door was opened. There stood Mr. Dark.”  Instead we are simply told: “The door swung wide,someone entered and splayed his right hand on the counter. Charles stared….there was a single eye tattooed on the back of each finger”. It’s deliciously creepy because we as the audience know who this man is and to be afraid of him, but Charles has no idea of what has been happening up till this point.

We now jump back to the boys under the sidewalk. The boy continues to call for his mom, and manages to catch the attention of the Dwarf-who-used-to-be-Fury.  The boys attempt to squish themselves invisible into the corners of their hidey-hole as the mother of the little boy pulls him away, but it’s all for naught. The Dwarf looks down and sees them. As he looks, Will notices that somehow they’ve turned him more machine than human. For the third time, someone associated with the carnival has their eyes compared to Cameras.

What do you think Bradbury is trying to say with this continued motif?

The dwarf sees but doesn’t seem to recogonize, like a camera with film that needs to be developed.  Instead he “photographs” them and, distracted by the laughter of children, skips off.

The dwarf is a great example of how the Carnival can completely break a person.  Do you think Jim is beginning to see the Carnival for what it is, or is he still drawn to the idea of it’s power?

The story again jumps back to Charles. (This back-and-forth narrative serves to continually heighten the tension until both parties are drawn together later in the chapter.) Charles is finishing up his third cup as he turns to leave and notices the Illustrated Man (aka Mr. Dark) staring at him.  Charles nods and leaves as he hears Mr. Dark ask about two boys he’s looking for. Ned seems to start to answer him, but Charles leaves before he can hear the answer, but it seems the Illustrated Man doesn’t really listen to the answers either as he stares off after Will’s father.

Charles then leaves and stands outside the cigar store to smoke.  Will and Jim see him standing there, and Jim tells Will to call to him. Will refuses thinking that his father looked even smaller than he had the other night in his house.  He compares him to a boy and thinks that they don’t need a third boy to get in trouble with them, they need a general or a major general to help them in this fight. Charles ponders why he came back this way, to smoke a cigar he didn’t particularly want; he thinks he heard someone calling out to him once or twice, and so he came back. He drops the cigar band through the grate, and notices Will and Jim hiding there.

He attempts to question the boys, while the boys plead with him to not look down at them.  The Illustrated Man leaves Ned’s and begins to walk down the street towards Charles. Charles straightens up just as the Illustrated Man approaches.  He asks Charles if he would be willing to help identify two boys who won free passes to all the carnival rides. He then thrusts out his hands to show the face of Jim and Will tattooed onto his palms. Mr. Dark knows that Charles knows the boys names, but is too eager, alerting Charles that something’s up. Charles decides to lie about their names, and Mr. Dark informs him that he knows those names are wrong.  He says that their names are Jim and Will, and they were simply fact-checking that information.  Charles says there must be a lot of boys by those names in the town, and he’s not sure which ones they might be. Will ponders how Mr. Dark got their names, and thinks maybe the young-girl-Ms-Foley must have told him. Charles challenges Mr. Dark about his intentions and why a strange carnival man would lie to him, and Mr. Dark clenches his fists, digging his nails into his palms. Jim and Will both suddenly feel immense pain in their heads, while two drops of blood come from Mr. Dark’s palms. The blood falls through the grate and drips onto Will’s cheek.

Will's father says he cannot help and everything seems fine until the Dust Witch comes around the corner. She begins to sense the boys, but Will tries to mentally warn his father to do something or they’ll be caught. Halloway lights his cigar again and blows the smoke in her direction. She chokes and coughs and has to leave, taking Mr. Dark with her, but when Charles Halloway says something to Mr. Dark, the Illustrated Man comes back and asks him for his name. Halloway tells him the truth, where he works, and Mr. Dark says he will pay a visit. Will's father tells the boys to hide and then come to the library at seven.

This scene has always been particularly intense for me because of the tattooed images on Mr. Dark’s hands.  In the Christian New Testament, Christ tells worshippers that they are “engraven upon his palms” and that it means he will never forget them. For me, it’s especially dark to have this very sinister character literally do just that - like an un-spoken threat to never forget what the boys have done.What do you think the symbolism is for having the boys faces tattooed onto his hands? Do you have any different thoughts than mine about the meaning behind it?

We get to see Will have a complete 180 turn in how he thinks about his father. He starts off seeing his dad as very small and helpless, and ends with thinking that he was wrong, and that his father was a giant. What do you think is the purpose of this change?



Ch. 36

The dwarf is making his way down the street when he very belatedly realizes what it was he saw under the grate earlier.  He makes his way to Mr. Dark, and tells him, but by the time they reach the grate again the boys are gone.



Ch. 37

Charles wanders the rest of the festivities for a while, and eventually doubles back to make sure the boys have left their hiding spot.  Satisfied that they successfully got out, he makes his way back to the library.  Charles begins to read and think about the situation, surrounding himself with things that focus on oddities and the occult. Spread in a circle, similar to a clock lays several books and art pieces: A portrait of ""The Prince of Darkness"", The sketches of Giovanbatista Bracelli titled  [""Bizzarie Di Varie Figure""](https://io9.gizmodo.com/after-nearly-400-years-these-distorted-human-bodies-re-1541138506), A copy of [""Faustus""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faust) (the story of man who makes a pact with the Devil - also my favorite  [Wishbone episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLIS6KmwxxE)), a series of sketches focusing on [The temptations of St. Anthony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Temptation_of_St._Anthony) (a saint  said to have faced a series of supernatural [temptations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temptation) during his pilgrimage to the desert), a book on Occult Iconography. At the 6:00 position lay a book on the history of circuses, carnivals and shadow shows. There was also a book on things that fly through history, a book called “By Demons Possessed"", “Egyptian Philtres"" (a philtre is a drink credited with magical abilities), to name a few. 

Charles thinks about how everything he knows and how it adds up. He looks at a book about ""Physiognomie: The secrets of the individual's character as found in his face"", and wonders if you can automatically tell if a person is good or bad.  He decides that no, the boy's angelic countenances don't simply make them the ""ideal for your Woman, Man or Child of Excellent Bearing, Color, Balance and Summer Disposition.""  Conversely, it doesn't mean that the freaks have the faces of the cruel, covetous,etc.

He decides only one thing in all of this is certain. (Here's the titular line folks!) As Shakespeare wrote, 

“By the pricking of my thumbs, Something wicked this way comes.""

He thinks it is so vague, and yet so immense - encompassing the whole strange experience in a few lines. He then waits and hopes the boys will come soon.

What do you think is the importance of using this line from ""Macbeth"" as the title and main phrase for the story thus far?

Ch. 38

The boys cautiously approach the library, sneaking through the grass and the dark.  Will admits that he's even scared of the library - scared that the carnival might have gotten to his dad already and that he will be changed like the Dwarf was. He wonders if it's an ambush, and that someone won't know what happened to them until they accidentally get found pressed in the pages of an old book, years from now.

This is too much for Jim to takes off to the doors of the library and begins hammering on them. (Like when I'm outside at night and suddenly feel the need to sprint into my house. I know the feeling man.) Charles lets them in, and leads them back to where he was studying about the strange on-goings. He asks the boys to tell him everything, and they do. At the end, he tells Will and Jim that he believes everything.  Will is so relieved that he says he might cry, but Jim and Charles tell him there's no time for that.  He shows them his research and tells them that he found old newspaper clippings of the Pandemonium Shadow Show coming to town in 1888. The initials are the same for the two men (J.C Cooger, and G.M Dark) and Jim expresses disbelief that it could be the same men, though Charles disagrees.  Charles then shows the boys more newspaper ads - from 1860, 1846, 1888, 1910, and then present day.  Always in October, each time.  He then remembers an old sermon telling believers to ""Beware the Autumn People"".  He says most people are a mix of Summer people and Autumn people, and that up until now, he has been an autumn person.  

The boys don't quite understand, and think perhaps the Carnival has gotten to him after all.  Charles calms them down and tells the boys that if they're going to work together, they need to really know him. He realizes that he is determined to help them, even if it's late in the game.'

What is the importance of the discussion of ""summer people"" and ""Autumn people""? What do you think Charles is saying when he says he's always been an autumn person, and what is the significance of him deciding to help at this point in the story?

bookclub,"I'll have to \[try to\] keep this pretty brief this morning. I got a late start, and my eighteen month old is not at her most patient right now. I have until Sesame Street stops working.

**28**

*It was a time to say much but not all.*

The last chapter left us with the gulf between Will and his father open wide, but Will is ready to cross that gap, despite the difficulty he asks a simple, important question of his father:

*Dad? Am I a good person?*

*I think so. I* ***know*** *so, yes.*

What follows would be considered out-moded in modern literature, but the mid-novel philosophical lecture is well-worn territory for the time period. Here we're faced with the question of what goodness is good for, and we can boil the argument down to three simple facts about goodness.

First, Goodness helps in times of trouble, not your body, but your peace of mind.

Second, ""No man's a hero to himself"", meaning that it's difficult to see the goodness in yourself.

And finally, most importantly, being good won't make you happy, and might very well make you miserable. To be good is difficult, and the sinner will certainly be happier, Referring back to the second fact, a man who strives for goodness is unlikely to ever satisfy his own need to be good. 

Another thread that continues to run through this chapter is the purposeful exclusion of Will's mother, and it's easy to see her as a stand-in for all women in this scenario. There's a feeling cast that women can't possibly understand or tolerate the turmoil of men and boys' minds and hearts. 

The man and the boy warn each other away from the carnival, and while there's a lot left unsaid there's a lot smaller gap between the two of them as the chapter is about to close, and importantly Will sees the boy in his father for the first time, and knows exactly how to reach it -

*""Dad!"" he whispered. ""You ain't got the stuff!""*

And of course, what boy can resist a dare? Previously having balked, he follows Will up the makeshift ladder into the house.

Is there a danger in reigniting the spark of an old man's youth? *Bildungsroman* as a genre is largely about puberty as a transition, but is there an element of another 'transition' of manhood, the mid-life crisis, in this one?

If the previous parts of this novel turned on Jim's 'sinful' nature, what comes next depends more on Will's goodness.

**29**

Will awakes remembering something he hadn't really noticed before, just like the barbershop sign from earlier. This time it was the absence of the lightning rod on Jim's roof.

The only conclusion he could come to is that Jim took it down himself. Of course he did.

Bradbury indulges in poetry to describe the feeling of an approaching balloon (meaning, a hot air balloon rather than the more common sort) and of course that's because there is a balloon coming overhead. Both boys alert to its presence, and of course what they discover is that this novelty too is from the dark carnival, and the passenger of that balloon is the Dust Witch, the blind old woman, whose particular magic, described again in poetic language, allows her to search out the boys, feeling them out. 

She marks Jim's house, but Will is quick with a good idea to keep the carnival from finding them come morning. 

Jim laments his foolishness in removing the lightning rod, but had all his rods protected the salesman?

**30**

The boys return to their separate rooms, but Will knows this isn't over yet and isn't nearly done.

Will in his role as monomythic hero grabs his bow and arrow and prepares for combat with his first dragon.

Cleverly taking advantage of the Witch's blindness he guides her to an abandoned house, manipulating his own thoughts and feelings to draw her near. Readying to take her out, he draws his bow but it snaps in half. Overcoming the daunting moment, he throws the arrow instead and punctures the balloon, sending it careening off into the distance.

All of this he does alone, without Jim.

**31**

*Nothing much else happened, all the rest of the night.*

**32**

When morning comes, the carousel starts again and only one person hears it. Miss Foley hurries off towards the carnival.

Jim and Will prepare to go make their tour of confession and apology, and Jim describes his odd dream of a funeral for a massive balloon. Will tries at first to tell Jim what he did, but ultimately he keeps it to himself.

Their conversation is interrupted by the sound of a girl crying from under the tree. Jim tries to ignore it, to pretend he doesn't hear it and especially to pretend he doesn't recognize it. Will knows who it is, from the get-go and won't entertain Jim's protestations.

The girl is Miss Foley, scared and confused. She's been unable to find any help, and knows that nobody will believe her if she tells the truth.

Will promises to believe. Jim wants nothing to do with this, and they rush to Miss Foley's house to verify that the real Miss Foley isn't there, but from there they hear the sound of the carousel and there isn't any room left to doubt.

Will knows they have to help her, but Jim cries that they haven't even been able to help themselves. He doesn't know that Will has already begun to fight back.

The sounds of a parade coming through town commence, the girl Miss Foley isn't under the tree any longer, and they run.

**34**

Charles receives a phone call from his son, telling him they won't be going to the police station after all.

 They have to hide.

Charles hears the carnival music, wishes his son luck, and leaves the house.

Where is Charles going?"
bookclub,"Hold on to your butts folks. Crazy stuff is about to go down at **Cooger and Dark’s Pandemonium Shadow-Show**. You ready for it?

Ch. 23 
Last we left off, the not-Nephew had framed Will and Jim for theft, and taken off running towards the Carnival.  Jim sprints off after him, with Will running after *him*. Will thinks to himself that he surprised the not-nephew by chasing him, instead of waiting for the police.  He realizes that Cooger is running to the Carousel in order to try and age himself again. As they watch the Nephew climb on, the boy-man reaches a hand towards Jim. Seeing Jim react with desire towards the now-forward-moving carousel, Will tackles him. The boys tussle, and Will attempts to turn off the carousel.  Distraught, Jim tries to stop him - “*But Jim, behind, babbling, tore at Will’s hands. ‘Will, you’ll spoil it! No!’”. *
 
Will (for the first time really) actively fights back against Jim.  The two boys continue to fight, as Mr. Cooger continues to ride around the Carousel.  Will cries out that he thinks Mr. Cooger will try to kill them when he gets off and Jim replies that Mr. Cooger wouldn’t kill **him**.  (Pro-tip, if that’s your friend’s response to that fear, he’s not a good friend.  End of PSA.) Will pulls the handle to the carousel causing the ride to go even faster than before, losing control. The resulting blast knocks the boys to the ground, and they watch in horror as the carousel continues on it’s forward trajectory.  Mr. Cooger tries to fight the centrifugal force of the ride, but falls and bashes his head on the hoof of one of the horses. As the ride continues to spin out of control, lights come on in the surrounding tents, but strangely no one comes out. The control box to the carousel finally bursts, and all the lights go out.
 
The boys slowly approach the carousel to find Mr. Cooger, now upwards of 130 yrs old - mummified and horrible, but somehow still alive. (Side note: Bradbury describes him as “puling”, which is like a thin whimpering/wailing sound akin to a newborn, which makes the whole thing more awful for me. Ugh. Bradbury uses sound (or lack thereof) to carry tone a lot in this story, but especially in this chapter.  “*He brayed.” “The calliope howled, boiled steam, ran ancient dry, then played nothing, it’s keys gibbering as only chitterings…” “He was alive, puling like a babe…” *) Will is sick, and the boys take off running away from the carnival.
This is the first time that Will acts openly against the will of Jim, and defies him to the point of physical violence. **Why do you think that this is the first thing to spur him to action, rather than simply following in his wake?**
 
**Jim makes a point of stating that Mr. Cooger wouldn’t kill him, but doesn’t seem to think about what would happen to Will.  In this scene, it is Will (who represents boyhood and innocence) who acts the most “adult-like”, and Jim who acts rashly and selfishly. What do you think Bradbury is trying to say about adults vs. children?**
 
Ch. 24
 
We again see the imagery of the white moths fluttering against a light as the boys run to a phone box. Together, they call the police about what happened.  In a short while, Will and Jim return to the carnival with two policemen, and two medics from an ambulance. As they reach the carousel, they see the body is now gone, and Jim yells to Mr. Cooger that they brought help.  As he yells, the lights in the Freaks tent flicker on, and the tent flaps flutter in a sudden gust of wind. Entering into the tent, they see all the Sideshow characters in the tent, including a dwarf that Will thinks looks vaguely familiar. Mr. Dark stands on a stage, tattooing his palm. The boys see creepy-mummy-Cooger strapped into an electric chair. The boys insist that is the man they were talking about, and he had indeed been dying.  As the sideshow freaks gather closer, Will realizes with horror that the dwarf is the Lightning Salesman, who has somehow been smashed down into what is now a dwarf. Mr. Dark tells them all that they were just in time to see the carnival rehearsing their new acts. The policemen tell him that the boys thought they saw a man dying, and Mr. Dark dismisses it as the fear of boys. He introduces Mr. Cooger as “Mr. Electrico”, and that as part of their act, 100,000 volts of electricity will pass through him.
 
Will sees that Mr. Cooger is dead, and yells for it to not be allowed to happen, but Jim defends Mr. Dark saying telling Will that “It’s all right!” Mr. Dark throws the switch and the body is immersed in the light of blue electricty.  In the noise and light show, the boys are the only ones who seem to notice that Mr. Dark is yelling “Come Alive”, that everything in the tent seems to be saying “Come alive!”  *(Sidenote: that song from Greatest Showman suddenly got a **whole** lot creepier. )* As the lightning subsides, the old man in the chair opens one eye. The sideshow freaks begin to breathe for him. Mr. Cooger tells the police that he saw the boys sneak into the tent and decided to scare them by playing dead. The policemen seem to think it all a good show, and prepare to leave. Mr Dark gives boys free tickets, and asks their name.  Both Jim and Will give a fake name and run out of the tent.
 
**Why do you think Jim speaks up in defense of allowing Mr. Dark to go on? He speaks up right as the policeman goes to examine Mr. Cooger, thus stopping them from getting the proof they need to believe the boys.**
 
**Both Jim and Will understand that Mr. Dark has targeted them and will most likely enact some kind of revenge on them. Both boys express desire to bring Mr. Cooger back, but do they have the same reasons?**

**This chapter serves to again illustrate the difference between the children and the adults.  Once again, the adult policemen and medics seem clueless when Mr. Dark begins shouting. Will attempts to shout over the lightning as well, but no one is able to hear him.  Considering the continued comparison between youth and old age, what do you feel is being told to the reader through this moment?**
 
**As they leave, Mr. Cooger “knights” them, and says *I dub thee….asses and foolsssss...I dub….thee...Mr. Sickly...and….Mr. Pale…!”* What do you think he meant by that?**
 
This is one of my favorite chapters in the book, and so deliciously creepy. Bradbury’s use of descriptive imagery is amazing. “*For now, very slowly, as if roused by thunder, as if the electric fire were new dawn, one dead eyelid peeled itself open.” “The dessicated bellows refilled, then pin-punctured the swamp-air out in faint wails:...” “The old man husked out syllable on syllable. ‘Ha.’ Pause. ‘Ha.’ Pause ‘Ha.’”* I can’t wait to see what happens next!
 
**Start of Part II**

Ch. 25
 
Miss Foley, alone in her house,thinks about how a few years prior, she noticed that “her house was crowded with bright shadows of herself”, found in the mirrors of her house. She ponders what to do about Will , Jim, and the nephew (Mr. Cooger). Somehow she knows that something is wrong with the nephew, but she knows that it will be all right when she goes on the ride he wanted her to go on. He warned her away from the mirror maze, and told her that she needs to ride the carousel. She understands that throwing her jewels was a way to get rid of the boys who would try to stop her from using her ticket for the carousel, where she will find happiness. She wants to do something to make sure they do not interfere in the future. Miss Foley calls the library and asks Charles Halloway if he will meet her in the police station.
 
**What do you think about the fact that mirrors already seemed to haunt Miss Foley, even before the carnival came to town? What does that tell the reader about the purpose of the mirror maze?**
 
Ch 26.
 
On the way back, the ambulance pulls up next to the police car and one of the interns says that he thought the old man was dead. The police think he is joking, and in the back of the police car, Will and Jim are talked over when they try to expound. They get dropped off at two random houses close to the police station but do not go in. Will sees that Jim still holds his tickets for the free rides, even though he threw his away. Will wants to tell the Police Chief, or someone higher up about the carnival, but Jim convinces him that they have no proof. They discuss the Lightning Salesman/Dwarf, and Jim thinks that it would be all right if they could apologize to Mr. Cooger. Will explodes and begins to yell at Jim. He cannot believe that Jim is not afraid, why he does not seem to understand the danger.  * “Ulmers! Goffs! ...You need a two-ton safe to fall on you?...Ain’t that enough to scare the Jesus out of you, Jim?” * He even thinks the disappearance/death of Mr. Crosetti has something to do with the carnival. Will argues with his friend, telling Jim he does not really want to be older, but Jim does not agree. Will points out that Jim will leave him as soon as he is older, and that he is glad the machine does not work anymore, and Jim is angry with Will for destroying the machine. Will responds that when the machine is fixed, Mr. Cooger will certainly return for his revenge, and says that he’ll only come for Will since Jim will have “gotten in” with the carnival and given up Will.  Jim assures him that that wouldn’t happen, but their argument ceases when they hear voices nearby and stop to listen. Miss Foley is talking to Will's father about the break-in at her house. After a few moments of speaking she asks where the boys are if they are innocent. Will jumps up and climbs through the window after he hears her question.
 
**Why doesn’t Jim feel the same danger and urgency about the Carnival as Will? **
 
Ch. 27
 
Mr. Halloway walks the boys home. He will not wake Jim's mother as long as Jim promises to tell her first thing in the morning, and he lets Jim go home. The boys have secret iron rungs that they nailed into the ivy to make ladders up to their rooms. Charles Halloway briefly reminisces about being young and then talks to Will. He knows that his son is innocent, yet wants to know why he admitted stealing at the police station. Will tells him that Miss Foley wants them guilty for some reason. He starts to tell his father everything but then for some reason cannot. Will promises he will tell his dad in a few days.

**Lack of communication between the old and the young, particularly between Charles and Will is a running theme so far. What stops Will from simply telling his father everything?**


"
bookclub,"It's Wednesday, and that means I'm back in the chair. Let's not hesitate, there's need to be urgent.

**16**

Jim is missing. Though the boys managed to enjoy the carnival throughout the day, despite the knowledge of its malevolent nature and the mystery of the mirror house hanging over them, good things always come to an end eventually, and sure enough Will finds Jim in the mouth of the mirror maze, having clearly seen something, the same as Miss Foley had.

However, Jim isn't scared, but hypnotized. He won't tell Will what it was, doesn't think Will would believe him if he did. What do you think Jim saw in the mirrors?

More than that, he's eager to return in the night. Will doesn't want to go, but won't let him go alone. How do you think Will's loyalty is likely to be rewarded? Jim believes Will will always be there for him, but will he return the favor himself?

Before they can leave, they stumble across something unexpected.

**17**

We know something the boys do not, the last known where-abouts and activities of the lightning rod salesman are no mystery to us, and though we can't be sure what became of him, we now know he didn't come back for his bag.

Jim proclaims that bag is everything the salesman had and was, and that he just left it behind. Is a man defined solely by his work?

The mystery is too much for the boys, and though they'd previously thought to go home and then return in the night, they instead decide to wait it out.

**18**

*I don't believe signs.*

Jim says this as they come across an out-of-order merry-go-round. I think of the song ""Signs"" as performed by the Five Man Electrical Band, and later by Tesla, and that it says everything about the kind of person Jim really wants to be. The rules simply don't apply to him, or aren't real somehow.

He finds, however, that in this case the rules are enforced, and is quickly caught up by a red-haired, blue-eyed man who is eager to put Jim out. However, his hand is stayed by a second arrival.

This new character is more meticulously and robustly described than almost anything in the book up to this point, and in a literary sense this makes him much more real and concrete than anything else in the book. He introduces himself as Dark, and his red-haired colleague as Cooger, the proprietors of the circus, and he demonstrates immediately with his calling card that he is no ordinary person, but someone with magical abilities. Jim is not intimidated at all by Dark's display, and challenges Dark's credentials as a specialist in the repair of death watch beetles by presenting him with a dead insect to repair.

In accepting the challenge, the boys catch a glimpse of Dark's wrist which is covered in various images. Will calls out that he must be the tattooed man, but Jim corrects him, remembering the adverts, and calls him The Illustrated Man instead. Bradbury readers will note this is a call-back to a short story collection with a framing narrative released eleven years prior to *Something Wicked*.

Mr Dark asks Jim's name, who lies. They both know it. At this point, Will is virtually forgotten, as Dark shows Jim more of the illustrations on his arm. He gives Jim a card to ride the merry-go-round once it's repaired, and sends the boys on their way, but Jim doesn't want to leave and once again nets Will into waiting and watching, but like the vision in the house of mirrors, he won't reveal to Will what he saw on Dark's arms, except that it was a snake, though he sounds unconvincing and Will doesn't believe him. Jim is keeping more and more to himself.

 As they watch, Dark starts the meery-go-round, and the boys are surprised to see it run backwards, and Will notes that the music is backwards as well, though he can't immediately recall what the music actually is or how he knows it's backwards.

Mr Cooger boards the backwards carousel and the boys watch as something miraculous and strange happens before their eyes. He grows younger, year by year, to a boy younger than them.

In terms of the novel's philosophy of boyhood and manhood's separation, as espoused by Charles and Crosetti, what does it mean for a grown man, by any means, to be able to reclaim the form of boyhood?

Jim pays lip service to regret and a wish for safety, but determines that now that they've see this, they've simply got to keep going. Will reluctantly agrees. Is it impossible to turn back once one has gone a certain distance?

**19**

The boys reflect upon what they saw, as they follow the boy-Cooger, passing Crosetti's shop and going on to Miss Foley's house, where they see a boy looking out from the windows. They remember that Miss Foley mentioned her nephew, but it becomes apparent to them by looking at his eyes that this is, in fact, Mr Cooger play-acting as their teacher's nephew.

Jim badgers Will into charging in by playing on Will's natural goodness, indicating that they of course need to warn Miss Foley about the danger she's in. Will doesn't buy it and accuses Jim of not caring one tick about Miss Foley or the danger, and remembers a feeling he's had about an old dog he had who used to wander off on occasion and has the same feeling about Jim, that there was something in both the nature of Jim and that dog that required them to run off like this, even if they tried to be good most of the time.

Is it possible for people to contradict their supposed nature in the long term, or is it likely that people always are who they've always been?

Jim also isn't scared, though he should be. Will is terrified.

Miss Foley greets them happily at the door despite the hour and dismisses their concerns about her earlier episode as mere silliness. They see the boy in the background, and Miss Foley does introduce him as her nephew. Will wants to confess everything to Miss Foley right away, tell the whole truth then and there but Jim stops him and forced into a corner Will tells a lie - that Mr Crosetti is in fact, not ill as his sign said, but dead, but this news doesn't seem to shake Miss Foley at all, who continues the introduction as if she hadn't been told any such awful news.

Why is Miss Foley so imperturbable, and why does she accept this strange boy with evil eyes as being her nephew, and if he is not where has her nephew actually gone?

Robert, the boy, and Miss Foley try to get Jim and Will to stay, or to rejoin them at the carnival later, but Will deflects with excuses that Jim can't wriggle out of, and they settle on meeting up tomorrow instead.

Will finally identifies the music from the merry-go-round as being Chopin's Funeral March. (*Chopin only wrote one tune!* [Of course that's not really true.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_compositions_by_Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin_by_genre)) Will quickly, and in no uncertain terms ascribes a particular meaning to the composition's nature.

One of the things I find interesting about Bradbury, and this book in particular, is how he frequently indulges in poetic language, but almost never uses it to couch the deeper meanings of things, preferring to lay his intentions bare and easy for even the most casual reader to see. 

Determined not to reveal what they know, they leave whistling 

**Oh, Susanna**

One thing you'll likely have noticed by now is that Bradbury invokes specific pieces of music with some frequency. I thought I'd share a little bit about this particular composition. [It's a very popular traditional American tune,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYiXyZwgPB8) that most Americans are likely to be familiar with, if not really know it by name.  It also, interestingly, has a strong claim to being the world's first pop hit. In the early days of recorded music sales, when the high water mark for market success was under 5000, a recording of Oh Susanna sold 100,000 copies. That's a fifth of what it would take to earn a gold record certification today. [This recording by notable rock group The Byrds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL44hJ6jtJo) came out a few years after *Something Wicked* was published.

**20**

Arriving home, both boys are punished by their respective parents by being sent to their rooms without supper. (Their continuously hungry state since the start of the novel carries on as a motif.) 

Separately, the boys cope with the events and the problems facing them, unable to consult with one another for fear that parents might overhear. As it grows late, Charles briefly tries to talk to his son, telling him only to be careful. but silently Will wishes the same to his father. The age barrier keeps them from meaningfully communicating. Will's father leaves, presumably to go to the library.

Desperately, Will tries to catch Jim's attention but no number of marbles thrown manages to call him. 

**21**

Aside from throwing rocks and marbles at windows, the boys have another system for communication involving an old boardwalk tuned like a piano to send musical messages. 

[Way Down Upon The Swanee River](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUrSiV9juIU) to indicate it's time to explore the river caves.

[Marching Through Georgia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pMRLnSYWbQ) to tell of ripe peaches, plums or apples outside of town.

No music comes for a long time, until he suddenly thinks he hears Chopin's Funeral March played out upon the boards, but looking out the window he sees that Jim could not have been the one who played it, because he is just then making his escape out his own window, and has no intention of calling Will to come along. Will feels betrayed, and makes to follow Jim anyways.

What's calling Jim to leave his best friend behind?

**22**

Jim has returned to Miss Foley's house to make contact with the boy Robert, who is really Mr. Cooger. Will sees, from hiding, that his friend has that same kind of look he has when he goes to the Theatre to spy upon its occupants. Somehow, this adventure has the same appeal of the forbidden and adult to Jim, and just the same Will does not feel that same call.

Leaping out to save Jim from his own worst instincts, Will calls for his friend and is rebuked. *""Will, go home! You'll spoil everything!""*

Jim makes the threat that if Will doesn't let him go, he'll remember when he's older. What's the meaning of this odd threat?

Will realizes that Jim wants to grow up, to ride the merry-go-round into the future. How might this relate to the vision he saw in the house of mirrors, or the one on Mr. Dark's skin?

What does Jim know now that Will doesn't, that has its claws so deeply in him?

Unwilling to abandon Jim, Will does what boys do in these circumstances: he attacks, and the boys get into it. In the midst of their fight Robert appears and Will is shocked that he seems to be a normal boy, that might join them at any moment. Instead, he runs inside and emerges with a fistful of jewelry which he plants around the scene of Jim and Will's fight and begins to yell for help. Miss Foley runs to the window and recognizes the boys.

All three run and Will fears that now they'll be thought of as thieves and scoundrels and however unbelievable their story might be, it would now be impossible to get anybody to accept it. The boys are on their own.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Oh my what a cliff hanger we're left with! The boys reputations might soon be in tatters, and their relationship just as much so! Can Will save Jim, and from what? Is the shadow of impending adulthood possible to avoid or delay once it has shown itself? Is it worth doing? Can Jim come back to Will, or must Will advance upon Jim's position, or worse might they be torn asunder nevermore to fall in matching step? 

Weigh in below!

### Chapter 8

Will arrives home and is surprised to see both his father and mother sitting quietly. In talking with Jim about the Carnival, they managed to lose track of time so as to get home after his father, despite leaving the library before him.  As Will watches them he is struck by the notion that his parents aren’t as big as he always believed them to be.  He wonders why his father is so sad and his mother is so happy. He sees that his father holds a handbill for the show, but when he steps into the room Charles Halloway hides the paper. Will goes to bed, hears his father burn the handbill, and then listens to his parents talking. His father is sad and feels old, and Will understands that the carnival worries his father, especially because Charles does not tell his wife about the handbill. He grabs a book to read and realizes he has accidentally grabbed one of Jim's dinosaur books, which he decides to read anyways. Just before falling asleep he hears his father leave the house, headed back to the library.

What do you think is the significance of the fact that even talking about the carnival seems to warp a sense of time and reality for the boys?  Why is Charles so upset about the carnival so as to hide and burn the flyer? What does Will’s realization that his parents were “*awfully small in too large a room in too large a town in too big a world”* illustrate about him to the reader? Even though Will has the wrong library book, he decides to read it anyways. What is the importance of this to you?

&amp;#x200B;

# Chapter 9

The story now jumps to Will’s counterpart, Jim.  Jim lies in bed, his dark eyes, (“*with shadows under the eyes from the time, his mother said, he had almost died when he was three and still remembered.”)*, dark brown hair, and the dark veins in his face and neck make him ""marbled with dark."" Jim ""*talked less and smiled less as the years increased*."" He was fascinated by the world, both the good and the bad.  “*And when you never look away all your life, by the time you are thirteen you have done twenty years of taking in the laundry of the World”.*  Will Halloway, on the other hand, looked away so often that he had seen only six years. The boys are again contrasted against each other as one being more representative of innocence, and optimism (Will), while the other is more grim and realistic of the world’s ills (Jim). Jim's mother comes into his room and they talk. She chides him for not looking after his health, and tells him to close his window. When he brushes off her concern, she tells Jim that he won’t understand until he has had three children and only have one live. He tells her he never plans on having children. When questioned, he states, “*No use making more people. People die…..I’m never going to own anything that can hurt me.”*  Jim’s mother tells him that people have to get hurt as part of life, and he disagrees.  Jim then asks if she remembers his father. She tells him he looks like his father, a man who had hit her and left her, long ago. She tells him that she knows he is going to leave, that everything about him seems to running towards the future, away from the now, but that she wants him to say goodbye to her before he leaves her. She closes the window and leaves. Once she leaves, Jim reopens the window, and decides to knock down the lightening rod. “*Why, he thought, why don’t i climb up, knock that lightning rod loose, throw it away? And then see what happens? Yes. And then see what happens!”*

What does this chapter teach us about Jim’s motivations? How is he different from Will? The Author doesn't tell the reader if Jim merely thinks about taking down the lightning rod, or if he actually follows through. Do you think he actually knocked down the lightning rod? Why do you think that?

&amp;#x200B;

### Chapter 10

It is now midnight.  The lightning-rod salesman, walking down the street, stops at the empty shop that Charles Halloway stopped at earlier. White moths flutter against the window of the shop. The lightning-rod salesman is drawn to the window and inside he sees the woman in the ice. She represents to him all of the beautiful women he has seen in his life, and seems to morph and change as he stares at the ice. Just as he knew Jim Nightshade’s name, he is struck with the knowledge that he knows what the ice maiden’s eye color is.  He wonders what would happen if the ice melted, and he touches the shop door, which swings open. He steps in and the door shuts. The scene closes with the moths’ continual fluttering against the window.

Why do you think the salesman saw something, while for Charles the ice was an empty block? What does Bradbury put such an emphasis on a detail like the moths fluttering against the window, drawn to the light. Does it add or detract to the story for you when the author uses imagery in this manner?

&amp;#x200B;

### Chapter 11

At three in the morning, Will and Jim are both awakened by the sound of a train. The boys hear the faint strains of a calliope playing on the wind.

 (For those of you who weren’t sure what a Calliope is, I tried to find two different samples of a creepy Calliope, which is different from a pipe organ. Calliopes use steam to create sounds through the pipes, and have no volume control. They are often also called steam organs or Steam pianos. [Calliope 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoIr2Kk8YjM) [Calliope 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJDgtK2PHgs))

The boys both lean out of their respective windows and spot the train coming over the horizon. The train engine is an old steam engine, and all the rest of the train cars seem equally as old. The sound of discordant calliope music sounds again, and Will recognizes the music as hymns, but that have been changed somehow. Jim decides to run down and watch the carnival set up, and takes instant action.  Will is more reluctant, but doesn’t want Jim to go alone, and so chases after him.

What is the significance of the music that the train plays? What about the appearance of the train? It is described as being old enough to be from the Civil war - what does the description do to foreshadow or set up ambiance?

&amp;#x200B;

 

### Chapter 12

As they chase after the train, Jim is likened to a kite that’s caught the wind, while having it’s string cut.  Will thinks about the fact that Jim favors action while he favors talking things over. “*Boy it’s the same old thing. I talk. Jim runs. I tilt stones, Jim grabs the cold junk under the stones and- lickety-split! I climb hills. Jim yells off church steeples. I got a bank account. Jim’s got the hair on his head, the yell in his mouth, the shirt on his back and the tennis shoes on his feet. How come I think* ***he’s*** *richer?”*  As the train blows past, the boys realize that there’s no one playing the calliope. Rather, the wind rushing past the whistles has made it produce the sad music they hear. The train's engine whistle blows, and both Will and Jim are brought to tears by the agony of the whistle. “*The wails of a lifetime were gathered in it from other nights in other slumbering years; the howls of moon-dreamed dogs, the seep of river-cold winds through January porch screens which stopped the blood, a thousand fire engines weeping, or worse! The outgone shreds of breath, the protests of a billion people dead or dying, not wanting to be dead, their groans their sighs…”* They follow the train to the meadow it has stopped in, only to realize that they don’t see any people anywhere. Both the engine and the tender car are empty and dark, as are all the cars. Suddenly they see a balloon fill up the sky with someone silhouetted in its basket. A tall man in a dark suit gets off the train and signals. Immediately afterward, people begin setting up, but their silence troubles Will while intriguing Jim. The moon is covered by clouds, and when the darkness lifts the tents are set up and the field is empty. Will immediately goes to leave, but has to prod Jim to get him to look away from the black tents. It is only when a bird screams that Jim becomes scared and the boys race home together. 

When Will is pondering the differences between him and Jim, he acknowledges their immense differences.  Why do you think he follows Jim into things that perhaps he isn’t as comfortable in? What could the analogy of Jim being akin to a kite with a broken string foreshadow later on?

&amp;#x200B;

### Chapter 13

Inside the library, Charles Halloway sees Jim and Will run by. He also sees, far away, glass glinting from the carnival and ponders on the Mirror Maze and whether one would see their own reflection, or simply an eternity of faces stretching on into old age. He is unsure whether or not he will go to the Carnival and seems to debate with himself on his own desires. On the way home, he passes the empty store where the lady in the ice had been, but all that remains is a pool of water, a few shards of ice, and some hair in the ice. Charles Halloway sees these things but tries not to think about them.

Why is Charles so conflicted about the carnival? If he feels something amiss, why is he still drawn to the Pandemonium Shadow Show?

&amp;#x200B;

 

### Chapter 14

Will hears his father talking to himself, muttering the word three, and he wonders if perhaps his father knows about the carnival as well. Charles thinks that three in the morning is a special time. Women and children sleep, but middle-aged men can only lie in bed and think of their lives. He thinks that women are Time, for they ensure their immortality through birth. But men can only despair at Time, and he reflects that three in the morning, when that despair is deepest, is when the train came. Charles  is deeply troubled by the carnival, and its arrival at three in the morning further convinces him that something is wrong. He thinks deeply about that hour and considers it to be a time when men are most vulnerable. He believes that men and women are fundamentally different because women actually give birth and therefore are a part of the cycle of Time. Men, on the other hand, although they are necessary for birth, do not really feel themselves to be a part of Time, and instead feel it working against them. While women gain immortality through children, men can only see Time as an enemy that cannot be defeated, and three in the morning is the time when that battle seems most hopeless. The fact that the carnival arrived at the hour when men despair for their lives is a very bad omen to Charles Halloway.  
Do you think that’s a fair assessment on the part of the Author that women are more immortal in the sense that they have a more direct tie to their offspring? Is it okay that the women in the book so far seem to be unaware of something that is looming, or is it simply an over-romanticized notion similar to the nostalgia of boyhood that was established earlier in the book? 

&amp;#x200B;

 

And now’s when the action really gets going. Hang on kids, it’s gonna start to get crazy.

**Chapter 15**

Will and Jim head out to check out the carnival early the next morning, and to their great surprise, it seems like a normal carnival. They bump into Miss Foley, their seventh grade teacher, who is searching for her nephew Robert and decides to head off to the Mirror Maze. Similarly to his father, Will is struck with sudden horror at the thought of the Mirror maze and warns Miss Foley not to go in. Ignoring his pleas, She enters the maze and disappears from view. Jim questions Will’s sudden outburst, which Will says is because the mirrors are the only things that seem similar to the experience the night before.  As the boys are discussing the strange sense of dread they both feel, Miss Foley begins to scream from within the Mirror Maze. The boys manage to pull her out and she tells them that they must go find the little girl who is lost in there. Upon further questioning, Miss Foley tells the boys that there was a girl in the mirrors, who looked like herself when she was younger. Miss Foley then abruptly leaves to go home.  Will wants to leave the carnival, but Jim challenges him and calls him a chicken, telling Will that they’re going to stay until dark in order to get to the bottom of the mystery. Will reluctantly agrees, but both boys agree to stay away from the Mirror Maze.

What are your thoughts on the Mirror Maze? When Charles looked at it, he thought you would see your face older and older.  However Miss Foley saw herself as a younger girl. What is the significance of this? 

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts as the story begins to build? Are there any things so far that have really stood out to you?  "
bookclub,"Welcome to regular discussion. I'm not going to bore you all with preamble, let's get right into it.

&amp;#x200B;

**First things first**

Anybody who's completed high school literature is likely aware that the title of the book is derived from Shakespeare's Macbeth. In Act IV, Scene I we open upon the witches going about their business, when one of them exclaims ""*By the pricking of my thumbs / something wicked this way comes / open, locks / whoever knocks*"". The wicked something, of course, is Macbeth himself, come to demand answers of the witches, who refer him to their spectral masters who deliver that infamously tricksy bit of prophecy that tells him to beware Macduff but that ""no man of woman born"" shall ever kill Macbeth.

Do you have any thoughts or predictions of the relevance of the title's source material?

**Prologue**

*October is a rare month for boys*

Though it may not seem so at first blush, this brief prologue is something really special in literature. While the great bulk of prologues are chapters divorced from the main narrative acting as a prelude, Bradbury uses these few paragraphs instead as a sort of overture for the entire novel, laying out in the fashion of that first piece of music before the opera begins, the tone and the notes that we'll see throughout the novel.

We learn immediately that the novel is focused on boyhood, and though the prologue is more plain-spoken than most of the novel we get a couple snippets of the novel's musical highlights in standout tonal quotes like ""*everything smoky-smelling and the sky orange and ash-grey at twilight*"" and the ""*strange wild dark long year*"", and most importantly we get the introduction in abstract of our principle characters James Nightshade and William Halloway, born just one day apart, and that ""*Both touched toward fourteen; it almost trembled in their hands""* and with that and the statement they grew up overnight, and ""*were never so young anymore. . .*"" we learn that the entire score is played to the tune of *bildungsroman*, the traditional ""coming of age"" story, but with the tone of the setting established, and that last ellipsis there's a discordant note of malice and menace.

**Part I - Arrivals**

[Man is in love, and loves what vanishes](http://www.csun.edu/~hceng029/yeats/yeatspoems/NineteenNinete)

**1**

The first chapter opens in the hours before what promises to be the dark and stormy night of well-trodden trope, a salesman of lightning rods arriving in a hurry to beat the storm. His attention is caught by our two main characters. He learns their names, and we learn the exact circumstances of their births separated by just one minute, on the dividing line of Halloween. He gives them a rod as a gift, with the warning that their houses are in especial danger from the lightning. This rod is special, an ordinary thing turned into a kind of mystical relic by the carvings of many languages and symbols. We learn also that the salesman's name is Tom Fury, and that he did not take the name himself but that the name guided him to his future profession. With further prompting he narrows his prediction to which house will suffer. To Will: ""*Oh, a few sparks'll jump on your rainspouts. But the real show's next door here, at the Nightshades'!*""

With a few more warnings about the horrible consequences of lightning strikes, Fury departsleaving the boys to mount the lightning rod. Will is eager to do the job and save Jim's house, but Jim only says ""*Why spoil the fun?*"" Regardless Will proceeds to do the job, admonishing Jim that he wouldn't want his mother burnt, would he? Still Jim only hesitantly follows Will's lead.

Already in this first chapter we begin to see the dividing lines between Will and Jim. What do you think of the salesman's prophecies? What's in a name like Fury or Nightshade?

**2**

The second chapter opens with Jim's opinions about books, and already you might not be surprised by his areas of interest. We look also at Bradbury's assessment of what boyhood friendship is: running, together, without competition. 

Does this jive with your own perception or experience?

They arrive at the library, which the boys perceive - of course - as magical, containing multitudes of lands and adventures to journey to. We also meet Charles William Halloway - Will's father. Will is surprised, as he always is, by the vast gap of age between them. Charles is witty and literate, and banters lightly with the children, and expresses a new dichotomy to them: the black hat or the white hat, that traditional trope of westerns though many who've never seen a cowboy movie will understand the trope still through the lens of modern cyberculture. Charles comments that Jim already wears the black hat comfortably, and tries to set the white hat, metaphorically, on Will's head, but Will resists, asking instead for something less decided, Jules Verne.

What do you think about the dichotomy of good and bad presented here? Do you think the listings of authors by category by Charles says anything about the nature of literature (and maybe Bradbury?) What hat does Charles wear?

**3**

""*Watching the boys vanish away, Charles Halloway suppressed a sudden urge to run with them.*""

Charles is a man bereaved of his own boyhood, and through the lens of his memory of it thinks he knows a thing or two about the boys. Jim is a strange and wild boy, while Will, he thinks is fundamentally *good*. 

*""Oh they're not above peeing off a bridge, or stealing an occasional dime-store pencil sharpener*""

After all boys will boys, right? Do you think this comment says anything about the standards of goodness in young boys, and how this influences adult behaviors in men? (Please, for the sake of our collective sanity, let's keep specific current events out of this.)

Most specifically, Charles equates this goodness to the way a person takes injury. Good people get cut and bruised and nurse the wound and wonder why, while people more like Jim are ""*ducking, waving, bouncing away from the knockout blow which must inevitably comes.*"" Is this another bit of prophecy like Fury's?

Charles finds his way to the bar, for just one drink and is treated to a speech about the historical perception of alcohol as a magical elixir. He says ""*I don't need it . . . but someone inside me does.""*

Is manhood more than just the continuous suppression of boyhood?

**4**

Another clear dividing line is established in Green Town: night and day. In Will's eyes, the town changes at the nine o clock bells with no bleed over between. When Will comments that you'd think the storm was already there, Jim replies that *they're* the storm.

Is Jim right?

Making their way through town, they encounter Mr. Tetley the cigar store owner, who goes frozen in the middle of teasing the boys. The boys run, and come across Mr. Crosetti, the barber, similarly struck, and beginning to cry. He's there enough to comment and talk to the boys, at least, and says it's the smell of licorice and cotton candy. ""*Why? Because I remember how a long time ago, boys ate that stuff. Why haven't I stopped to think and smell the last thirty years?*"" The boys know, as they would, that those things are not relegated to the distant past, but Will comforts Crosetti by telling him he's just been too busy. 

Will begs Crosetti not to turn off the barber's pole, and Crosetti agrees and leaves it on. ""*It's good to know, thought Will, it'll be running until dawn, winding up from nothing, winding away to nothing, while we sleep.""*  What is the value of something constant in a storm, literal or metaphorical?

**5**

Charles exits the saloon into the same version of the town the boys have just been wandering through, and encounters a man putting up roller posters and whistling a familiar tune ""*incongruous for October*"", the [The Henry Wadsworth Longfellow penned Christmas hymn, I Heard The Bells on Christmas Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMmRkimMBOE), providing another glimpse of dichotomy - or perhaps a first juxtaposition.

The posters declare the arrival of Cooger Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show, a circus and carnival that couldn't sound any more sinister if the word evil was painted all over it. What catches Charles's attention is the block of ice, and the placard declaring THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD.

The ice contains a hollow place suggestive of a woman who might soon occupy that space. 

What might the promise of a glimpse at this astounding woman mean to Charles?

**6**

The night has not ended for the boys, either, and Jim wants to make one last stop - at a house the boys call the Theatre, where open windows and careless adults promise glimpses of dramas and forbidden sights. Jim is obsessed, but Will wants nothing to do with it. Having seen sex through those windows, and not understanding it, Will had previously run away from the unwanted knowledge, but Jim continues to want more. Jim hands his books to Will, who won't go, and the boys separate.

Is the act of Jim giving Will the books to go to the Theatre instead meaningful? What does this decision on the part of each boy say about them?

**7**

Nobody was home, and Jim catches up with Will. Still upset at Will's prudishness, Jim insults him by calling him a Baptist a second time. A flyer floats across their path and Will grabs it from off Jim's leg. This flyer, like the posters, promises the carnival's arrival, and a litany of promised marvels of which Will is skeptical, but excite Jim's imagination, but like Charles, they boys are most caught by the promise of THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD. Will still doesn't quite believe in all of it, but Jim points to the smell of licorice and cotton candy, and the hint of music. They realize they're suddenly at home, and Jim knowing that Will is still upset, promises he won't go back to the Theatre for a year.

As they say goodnight, Will is comforted by the fact of the lightning rod, that ""*grand contraption*"" protecting Jim's house from the storm.

Given their different reactions to the Theatre, what might the promise of the beautiful woman mean for each of the boys? Do you think the lightning rod will provide protection to Jim? What might it mean that Will doesn't have such protection?

bookclub,"Hi guys! 

So, it's over. We have finished *Memoirs of a Geisha*. 

What did you think? What bothered you? What did you like? Would you read it again? Who was your favorite character? Did you learn anything? Any unpopular opinions?"
bookclub,"So! Now that we're done reading *Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell*, I'm interested in discussing some of the below concepts that I mentioned in the very first post:

* North vs south
* Sanity vs insanity
* The dynamics of power and how those in power push down those not in power
* Manners

What did you pick up during your time with the book? And last of all, did you like it? I know most of us got frustrated with its meandering and often-nonexistent plot; were its humor and final plot elements worth the read?

**Chapter 66: Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell**

Having cleverly separated Norrell from his friends, Jonathan Strange asks his assistance in summoning John Uskglass. They work together again with ease and uncharacteristic humbleness to summon Uskglass, and after observing that they’re now both entrapped by the Black Tower spell on Strange, discover him, or someone who has his name, in Yorkshire.

**Chapter 67: The hawthorn tree**

Childermass come across Vinculus’s corpse and realizes that the King’s Letters is written all over it. As he’s trying to figure out how to transport the body or the message, he notices another man bending over it. The man says Childermass is his servant and that Childermass said so a day or two ago, and Childermass can’t think who it is… but all the clues point to John Uskglass, who Strange and Norrell have just summoned. He does some magic and walks away.

Childermass comes to without remembering what happened, and Vinculus is alive. Over breakfast, Vinculus tells him that Norrell and Strange are the spell that Uskglass is doing to bring magic back to England again.

**Chapter 68: “Yes.""**

Norrell and Strange try to think of a way to get Uskglass’s attention.

The TD man continues on his killing spree. He appears at the sanitorium where Lady Pole and John Segundus are.

Strange and Norrell find the spell and get the English countryside to bow to the “nameless slave” and acknowledge him as its king… but something is wrong, is it actually John Uskglass? No, it is Stephen.

He doesn’t really seem to get what’s going on in any sort of intellectual sense, but accepts their fealty, and the TD man is imprisoned in a beck, which seems to be a quarry pond. Using magic, he buries the TD man in an enormous cairn, just in time for the English countryside to realize he’s not their king, and withdraw.

At the Greysteels’ in Padua, the mysterious mirror changes to show a running woman. They help her out of the mirror and discover that she is Arabella Strange. Turns out Strange’s errand to Flora was placing the mirror in her home.

Stephen walks away from Lady Pole, who is looking for him, to find himself the king of Faerie. He seems reasonably comfortable with this, and his first edict is that he’s going to put right the wrongdoings of the TD man.

When the spell happens, some weird shit happens at Hurtfew, starting with visions and ending with a giant eye looking at J&amp;S. They realize that everything is how they want it, but they have no idea what they did.

**Chapter 69: Strangites and Norrellites**

Vinculus notices that the words on his body have changed! To him, this means that the prophecy has been fulfilled. 

Norrell and Strange are missing, and so are their homes. No one knows what’s up. An ad in a newspaper appears, inviting all magicians to the York society. The new magicians are diverse lot. They start fighting about whether Strange or Norrell is the good magician, and then Childermass appears. He’s the one who took out the ad. He offers the magicians a book: Vinculus.

In Padua, Arabella is being well-treated by the Greysteels. Strange shows up one day, on a fairy road, and tells Arabella that he and Norrell are traveling, looking for a way to kill the spell of darkness. He asks her to wait for him, and not to dress like a widow."

bookclub,"Hey guys! 

Okay, let's just jump right in. I'm gonna summarize very very quickly and let you all take it away with then chapters. So, 19-27! 

So, we still have Hatsumomo trying to ruin Sayuri's life and kick her out of Gion. First, with the *mizuage*, or Sayuri's virginity. Sayrui easily enchants both Dr. Crab and Nobu, but when Hatsumomo finds out about Dr. Crab she jumps into action to destroy what little relationship they have. 

&gt; I certainly do not appreciate when people I have trusted turn out to have misled me. 

It seems he felt entitled to Sayuri's *mizuage*, which bothers me. What do you guys think? 

Moving on, in Chapter 20 we start by seeing how Hatsumomo treats Pumpkin and it makes me very sad. Then we find out that Hatsumomo told Dr. Crab Sayuri had a boyfriend that she snuck into the okiya, implying she was not a virgin. By the end of Chapter 20, they have done all they can to repair Sayuri's reputation, including getting her a role in the big dance performance. 

In Chapter 21, Sayuri is invited to Hakone and in 22 she travels to Hakone to visit the Baron in place of Mameha. This chapter made me angry. Sayuri is treated like a Disneyland character by the guests and the Baron behaves like Harvey Weinstein. Blagh. Just the last few paragraphs... I won't bother to reproduce them, but it created a physical reaction for me. 

In 23, Sayuri receives a gift from Nobu, gives it to Mother, and is told she is to be adopted in place of Pumpkin, much to Pumpkin's heartbreak. In 24 we find out why. **Sayuri's virginity was sold for 11,500 yen.** Enough to pay off her debt to the okiya and still have money left over. 

We then find out that Dr. Crab collects the blood from the girls he buys. 

Moving right along, Sayuri is free from harassment for the most part, is flourishing as a geisha, and finally, it looks as if Nobu wants to become her *danna*. 

&gt; Destiny isn't always like a party at the end of the evening. Sometimes it's nothing more than struggling through life from day to day.''

I loved that quote. 

Finally, in 25 we see Mameha attempt to keep Nobu from becoming Sayuri's *danna* by suggesting a general instead that might make the war years easier. This is easily accepted as what is best for the okiya.

As we end our chapters Hatsumomo is forced out of the okiya at last. What do you think of the way she is forced out? What do you think should have happened? 

Okay, looking forward to your replies! "

Drawlight visits Dr. Greysteel and pisses him off with rumors about Jonathan Strange. His entire aim seems to be slandering Strange. After being kicked into a canal, he washes up in the area of darkness and encounters Strange. (How many sentences can I end with Strange?) Strange turns Drawlight to his own side.

He instigates a bit of a hallucination in Drawlight, who takes days to recover, and then Drawlight heads back to England with messages.

Stephen has a visit from the TD man, and together they witness the dispersal of a huge flock of ravens, created by Strange, who is using them to network with the Raven King’s allies and all the British magicians that Norrell has silenced or prevented.

This bit is interesting:

&gt; The division and estrangement between [Stephen] and his English friends grew ever deeper. The gentleman might be a fiend, but when he spoke of the pride and self-importance of Englishmen, Stephen found it hard to deny the justice of what he said. … There at least Stephen had never needed to apologize for being what he was; there he had only ever been treated as an honoured guest.

The book doesn’t speak often of minorities, but when it does, it’s a bit poignant. Stephen has been acquired and more or less enslaved by the thistle-down man, but the TD man is giving him something that English society can’t: a sort of equality that he doesn’t experience in his day to day life. No one in the TD man’s world cares that Stephen is black. No one kills his beloved horse or beats him up. And while it’s not wrong that he’s treated well, it’s causing him problems by showing him what good treatment looks like. He resents his friendships in non-magical England because now he knows they’re not real.

**Chapter 60: Tempest and lies**

Flora, now in Padua (10-15 miles outside Venice) is acting awfully strange, a lot like Lady Pole and Mrs. Strange did. She walks outside in a thunderstorm thinking she sees someone on the balcony. We hear some bells shortly thereafter, oh no. She goes missing for awhile, and Aunt Greysteel finds her soaking wet and confused in the bedroom. Also, a weird mirror has appeared that Flora says she bought.

It turns out that the storm marked Strange’s movements, and that he went to visit Flora, who told him to stop doing whatever magic he’d been doing. A little while later, she takes her father and aunt on an excursion to the sea but doesn’t seem to know why.

**Chapter 61: Tree speaks to Stone; Stone speaks to Water**

Norrell and Lascelles are working on PR. Childermass, checking the mail, finds a report of some guy doing a complicated magic spell who has barely studied and who cites the trees and stones and water as telling him what to do. When they go to see Lord Liverpool, Liverpool blames Norrell for a spate of magical acts. They conclude that Strange is responsible for returning magic to England, and Liverpool tells Norrell to keep Strange from coming back. The chapter ends with an announcement that Drawlight has returned.

**Chapter 62: I came to them in a cry that broke the silence of a winter wood**

Drawlight and Lascelles meet in the woods. Lascelles, taking a shot at Drawlight, asks him if he’s sure that Strange didn’t turn him into something terrible, and I’m reminded of the Leucrocuta thing — any thoughts on that?

Drawlight tells Lascelles the messages and gives him the box, and Lascelles kills him. Drawlight’s body disappears in a tangle of vegetation."
bookclub,"All right, friends - we're entering the endgame now (at least, we better be; we're getting real short on pages to the right of my bookmark).  We begin with a chapter so full of important stuff that I think I shattered my personal record for ""longest chapter recap"".  So be it.  

**Chapter 55 - The second shall see his dearest possession in his enemy's hand (Night of 2nd/3rd December 1816)**

Strange is following the trail that he picked up at the end of the previous chapter and walks himself right into Lost-hope.  He recognizes right away that he is at the entrance to a fairy's residence and invites himself in.  He takes in a sight that is new to him, but familiar to us; a multitude dancing in a vast ballroom.  However what he sees is not so grand as the experience of the dancers; to his view, the room is falling apart in places and is in general disrepair.  Our man Stephen makes an appearance to tell Strange that he better hit the bricks, as the fairy hates him.  Strange is unconcerned.  Probably he should be at least *a little* concerned.  Either way, the T-D Man chats up Stephen about what to do with this interloper.  Stephen tries to suggest that perhaps releasing Arabella Strange from her captivity would mollify the magician and send him on his way.  The T-D Man is unconvinced and instead seems to think that darkness, misery, and solitude are the right solutions (whatever *that* means).  Strange then encounters a lady who slots Strange into a prophecy, a portion of which she recites.  She's not good enough to share the rest, and Strange can't recall it, but as far as I can find, all we have, prophecy-wise, are these words from Vinculus, back in Chapter 22:

""Two magicians shall appear in England;

the first shall fear me; the second long to behold me;

The first shall be governed by thieves and murderers; the second shall conspire at his own destruction;

The first shall bury his heart in a dark wood beneath the snow, yet still feel its ache;

The second shall see his dearest possession in his enemy's hand""

According to the weird lady, Strange is destined to fail.  This is news to Mr Strange, but according to the freaky femme, there are 47 failed magicians interred here at Lost-hope.  Strange takes his leave of the lady and continues to scan the party.  Much to his surprise, he finds his wife among the dancers.  Before he can discuss why she might be here at all (over Lady Pole's hostile interruptions), the T-D man shows up at his shoulder.  Instantly, all the party guests vanish, save for Stephen (who acts as witness to the following events), the T-D man, and Strange himself.  The T-D man utilizes multiple naturalistic spells to disorient Strange and then cast him out.  The T-D man is convinced that he's vanquished the magician and collapses at Stephen's feet.

**Chapter 56 - The Black Tower (3rd/4th December 1816)**

Dr Greysteel is awoken (awakened? woked? wakened? something, anyway) by one of his servants and is informed that Strange is outside and wishes to speak to him.  Strange is acting, well, oddly.  He won't come near to Dr Greysteel and asserts that Flora (Dr Greysteel's daughter) is in peril and must leave Venice.  Strange then disappears into the night, leaving Dr Greysteel to find a way to get his daughter to leave Venice.  The next morning, while they are trying to convince Flora to leave, a vast black tower appears in the centre of Venice.  Some officials from the city of Venice pay a visit to Dr Greysteel to inform him that in fact what he sees is not a tower, but instead the appearance of the sun having risen on all parts of Venice, save for the parish where Strange lives.  Greysteel pays a visit to Strange to ask him to knock it off with the whole Thirty Days of Night thing, but Strange has been too busy performing magic to even notice that the sunrise is well past due and insists that he is not the source.  After taking his leave of Strange, Greysteel decides to confer with Lord Byron, who's pals (kinda) with Mr Strange.  Lord Byron says all kinds of poetical stuff and it's inferred that some of this actually finds its way into the real-world poems of Byron, but someone more well-versed in his poetry would have to tell us for sure (get it?  poetry?  well-VERSED??).  

**Chapter 57 - The Black Letters (December 1816)**

This chapter contains a series of letters from Strange to Reverend Woodhope about Strange's discovery that Arabella is alive in another dimension.  In addition, we see the T-D man and our man Stephen are haunting Strange and and the T-D man is enjoying Strange's misery.  However, Stephen notices that the T-D man has still taken no further action against Strange and is unable to take back Lady Pole's finger.  Not 100% sure what that means yet, but something is afoot (or, a-finger).  

**Chapter 58 - Henry Woodhope pays a visit (December 1816)**

Reverend Woodhope brings the letters to Mr Norrell, who advises him to not go to visit Strange in Venice, arguing that would only encourage further madness.  However, Mr Norrell is keenly interested in what is going on with Strange, so he and Lascelles discuss a plan to send someone to find out what's going on.  Somehow, this plan involves charity, but to be honest, I didn't really follow what was going on there.  Kinda thought they were headed towards bribing Drawlight or something, but that didn't happen.  Also, The Duke of Wellington discusses Strange's behavior with the Ministers, who are far more concerned than he is.  A bookseller releases a book called The Black Letters that purports to include Strange's ramblings from Venice, however we're informed that a decent amount of the text was manipulated prior to publishing.  Finally, a friend of Lord Byron's appears to thwart efforts by Mr Norrell to seize Strange's letters to Byron via magical means.  Turns out a bible is all the protection you need from magical interferences.

Well, then - we've got some things happening - Strange seems to have at least a passing understanding of what's going on, but he's all tied up in knots now, Mr Norrell isn't any help, and yet somehow, it seems like the T-D man is on his heels and reeling from the loss of Lady Pole's finger.  I'm not sure what rule of the magician/fairy dynamic is at work here, but there's something that has the fairy spooked.  Also, Stephen ain't happy and when Stephen ain't happy, I ain't happy.  Are you happy?  How is this rolling up for you?  I was definitely expecting to stumble across the Raven King at some point, and I fear that might not happen.  Also, I was fully expecting to see a Strange-Norrell showdown, and that seems unlikely as well.  Honestly, I don't know WHAT the hell is going on."

 HAPPY VOTING!"
bookclub,"(I am new here, I hope I got the flair thing right).

&amp;#x200B;

I adore the Gormenghast trilogy. I think it is one of the greatest works of gothic literature that's ever been written. I would like you to read it, and fall in love with it just like I did. I will try to describe what is great about it, as well as I can tell it.

Imagery is the first thing that strikes you about Gormenghast, even before we focus on the plot. I believe we all associate gothic fiction with a certain type of imagery: a young girl in a manor with a tragic story arc to fulfil, as in Carmilla. A mysterious castle brimming with madmen, as in The Castle of Otranto. The tragic-yet-sympathetic anti-hero turned villain, as in The Sandman. An illustrious aristocratic family whose developing story is shrouded by a looming feeling of doom as its glory, challenged by either modernity or the cruel side of human nature, gradually crumbles to dust, as in Rebecca. The children's room full of old, broken toys, which evokes the feeling of foreboding associated childlike environment whose innocence seems to have been swept away by terrible and mysterious acts of human cruelty, as in The Woman in Black.

We are used to finding a single piece of gothic imagery in each novel, but Gormenghast contains all of it. Set in the majestic castle of Gormenghast, this trilogy tells the tragic story of the aristocratic House of Groan, whose members' names are carefully chosen both to impress and to convey an idea of old-world - and somewhat dusty and cobwebbed and outdated - privilege and inheritance (the family's patriarch is named Lord Sepulchrave). The castle of Gormenghast is situated in the middle of a forest, far removed from the rest of civilisation, and life within its walls seems frozen in time. Generation after generation of servants is raised for no other purpose than to inherit their fathers' roles as faithful servants of the Groan family. Progress or enlightenment or the cognition of human rights are non-existent. Some of the servants are even more fanatically invested in the preservation of the traditions of Gormenghast than the Groan family itself. When Flay, Sepulchrave's loyal servant, sees the kitchen servants celebrating after the birth of the Groan heir, he is disturbed by the sight: 'It was not often that Flay approved of happiness in others. He saw in happiness the seeds of independence, and in independence the seeds of revolt.'

'Revolt' and 'independence' are foreign and feared concepts within the walls of Gormenghast, with the Groan family itself being trapped in a tiresome, overly-structured routine of ceremonial rituals, unbreakable Gormenghast traditions which must be upheld and performed no matter what. There is no notion of change, of social mobility, of equality, of progress. Everyone functions like a cog in the giant piece of clockwork that is the castle, everyone knows their place, and everyone's future is decided at birth.

Yet everything changes when Steerpike, a simple kitchen boy who loathes the oppressive, hopeless life which has been assigned to him due to his lowly birth, escapes his tyrannical superiors and, through the use of his charm and incredible cunning, manipulates various members of the Groan family in order to rise above his station and become Master of Ritual. Acting like the shrewd prince of all Slytherins long before Slytherin House was even invented, Steerpike is a Machiavellian figure who methodically wrecks havoc in the castle, terrorising its inhabitants and bringing tragedy upon the House of Groan in order to reach his final goal: become the one and only ruler of Gormenghast.

The story of Steerpike, his descent from a sympathetic underdog whose cunning is necessary for survival to ruthless tyrant warped by hateful envy and ambition, takes place against a sublimely atmospheric gothic backdrop. The madness and strangeness of the grotesque inhabitants of Gormenghast is brought to life through vivid descriptions. There is the quirky doctor of the Groan family, who collects rare poisons, is seen drawing ostrich skeletons on napkins whilst listening to his mentally unstable sister's tirades, and also likes to take long baths: 'Even in the bathroom he was wearing his glasses, and as he peered over the side to recover a piece of scented soap, he sang to his external oblique as though it were his love.' There is Nannie Slagg, the nanny of the heirs of Groan: 'A shrunken, pathetic creature she looked with the crowned doll in her arms. Her green satin gleamed mockingly in the afternoon light.' There is Flay, the fanatical servant: 'The old servant emerged from the shadows like a spider.' There is young Lady Fuchsia Groan, daughter of Lord Sepulchrave, in her blood-red dress: 'In the rough landscape away to his left, the tiny figure in its crimson dress sang out against the sombre background like a ruby on a slate.' And there are endless description of Gormenghast Castle, a character in itself: 'These dwellings, by ancient law, were granted this chill intimacy with the stronghold that loomed above them. Over their irregular roofs would fall throughout the seasons, the shadows of time-eaten buttresses, of broken and lofty turrets, and, most enormous of all, the shadow of the Tower of Flints. This tower, patched unevenly with black ivy, arose like a mutilated finger from among the fists of knuckled masonry and pointed blasphemously at heaven. At night the owls made of it an echoing throat; by day it stood voiceless and cast its long shadow.'

&amp;#x200B;

And without giving you any spoilery details, I can say Gormenghast would not be a proper traditional gothic novel if there was no 'special' relationship developing between the noble Lady Fuchsia Groan, and the perversely evil and tyrannical Steerpike. In the latter's words: 'And the time, if I may say so, Lady Fuchsia, when I climbed through the thunderstorm and over the rocks with you in my arms.'

&amp;#x200B;

If you loved Wuthering Heights and the tales of Edgar Allan Poe, the Gormenghast trilogy has got everything your heart desires and everything your heart does not yet know it desires. You have to read it. You'll love it. I promise.

bookclub,"Hey guys! We've made it halfway through this book, and I think it has gone fairly quickly. What do you think? Just your general impressions so far, do you like it or not? I've got to say, I've got a lot of complaints, but the language is beautiful. 

Let's jump into a quick recap of the chapters. 

In Chapter 15, we watch Hatsumomo begin her efforts to destroy Sayuri's career. We learn she has paid off a maid in every teahouse to alert her to Sayuri's location so that she can follow her and embarrass her. The only place Sayuri seems to go is to private parties and Mameha's house. At the end, she gets to meet Mameha's *danna*, the Baron. While standing before him, she thinks of her father. 

&gt; I wondered what he would think if he could see me kneeling here in Mameha's apartment, wearing a robe more expensive than anything he'd ever laid eyes on, with a baron across from me and one of the most famous geisha in all of Japan at my side. I was hardly worthy of these surroundings. And then I became aware of all the magnificent silk wrapped about my body, **and had the feeling I might drown in beauty.** At that moment, beauty itself struck me as a kind of painful melancholy. 

Jeez, I loved that quote, especially the bit about drowning in beauty. What a unique and wonderful idea. 

In Chapter 16 we see Pumpkin win the apprentice award, of course through Hatsumomo's cheating. I wonder if Mother knew or cared? Did it bother her that this would affect future business? Moving on, at the end of Chapter 16 Sayuri visits attends her first sumo match. Believing she is seeing Mr. Tanaka, she begins to formulate ways to be both rude and polite in the same instant, but before she is forced to put those plans into action, the man turns and she sees the man she's been dreaming about: the Chairman. 

&gt; I had seen the Chairman during only one brief moment in my life; but I'd spent a great many moments since then imagining him.

That is the intro to Chapter 17. Great intro. From there we get to meet Nobu. Hatsumomo still manages to show up and throw the geisha off their game, but watching Sayuri visit with Nobu seems to appease her. Of course, Sayuri wishes she could be visiting with the Chairman, but that is to be expected. 

In Chapter 18 we meet Dr. Crab and Uchida Kosaburo, both who are to be influential in Sayuri's future. This was a fairly short chapter, so I will leave it at this. 

What are your predictions for the future? What do you think of what you have read? What are your favorite quotes so far? 

Looking forward to hearing from you all! "
bookclub,"**Chapter 51: A family by the name of Greysteel**

Strange is in Venice with the Greysteels, and he’s attempting to summon a fairy servant. He hears bells, and Stephen Black and the thistle-down man appear (though Strange can’t see them).

**Chapter 52: The old lady of Canareggio**

I can’t quite figure out how or why we got onto this part, but Dr. Greysteel and company are looking for a poor woman and wind up in a Jewish ghetto. They find an old lady named Mrs. Delgado, who is surrounded by cats and doesn’t respond at all to anything that’s said to her, but is super excited when a cat appears from outside with a dead bird.

**Chapter 53: A little dead grey mouse**

Jonathan Strange goes to visit the old lady and uses the mouse she’s about to eat as a madness receptacle. In the process, I think he makes her disappear as well. He makes a tincture out of the mouse and then spends a few days being weirdly insane, and then, during a final attempt, summons the thistle-down man again and finds him.

**Chapter 54: A little box, the colour of heartache**

The thistle-down man and Strange have an awkward conversation, and then Strange dismisses the man.

Later, the TD man freezes the area around Stephen Black and comes to him in a bit of a panic, unsure how he was summoned. He has a pretty low opinion of Strange. He decides that he’s going to give Strange whatever he asks for and it will be terrible and then Strange will leave him alone.

After an odd episode with a sedan chair, the TD appears to Jonathan Strange and offers him whatever he wants. Strange wants information! And the TD man doesn’t want to give it. So he asks for something that the TD man gained from his last dealings with an English magician—which we all know is Lady Pole. Or, more conveniently, her finger.

Strange isn’t sure whose finger it is, though, and so he uses a spell to go and find the TD man.

In this section, Clarke introduces a bunch of new characters and concepts, like the Greysteels and Mrs. Delgado (and why is she in a Jewish ghetto?), but brings back Lady Pole’s finger. What do you think is going to happen? What do you think of the type of narration she’s using, where we know more than Strange does? Is it frustrating or satisfying to watch this play out?"
bookclub,"Hey guys, let's jump right in.

Chapters 11 and 12 mostly fine into Mameha becoming Chiyo's big sister, what it means, and what is expected of her. In chapters 13 and 14 we see first Pumpkin, and then Chiyo make their debuts. Pumpkin becomes Hatsumiyo and Chiyo becomes Sayuri. Finally, Sayuri has hope. 

So that's a quick recap. Tell me what made impressions on you. "
bookclub,"  

So! Here we are, many hundreds of pages in and some things are happening (and others aren’t). Without preamble, Iet’s get right to the recaps!

**Chapter 47 - ""A black lad and a blue fella - that out to mean summat."" (Late January 1816)**

Stephen and Sir Walter Pole are traveling along (lost) through a moor in Yorkshire.  When they come to a crossroads, our man Stephen takes charge of the situation and suggests that the coach carrying Sir Walter head one direction, while he heads the other, with the thought being that he'll send a text if he finds anything (since it's the early nineteenth century, WhatsApp hasn't been invented yet).  It turns out that our man Stephen has chosen correctly and he's the first to locate Starecross Hall (which I'm vaguely remembering as the ex wizard School).  Mr Segundus is still heading up an effort at the Starecross Hall, but rather than a magician's school, it's a place for people who are mentally unwell (which, technically, it would have been if it were a school as well - adolescents are CRAZY).  Either way, Lady Pole is being checked in for an extended stay (and hopefully, for a few afternoon naps to make up for her continued nighttime adventures).  After depositing Lady Pole at Starecross, Stephen gets into a fender-bender with another horseman, but rather than exchanging insurance information, he has to shoot his horse.  This leaves him in the middle of nowhere without a way to get home (Triple A wouldn't open their first England branch for roughly a century).  He catches a ride with an odd fellow who happens to have Vinculus (remember him? the crazy hobo magician?) riding in the back (all these guys really manage to stumble across each other ridiculously often).  Vinculus raves on about a prophecy that seems to refer to our man Stephen being raised up to the position of king.  Shortly thereafter, our man Stephen goes on another sojourn with the Thistle-Down Man, this time to watch a wolf hunt and to discuss the T-D Man's assertion that Vinculus's prophecy refers only to the Raven King's rise and is in no way related to Stephen or his kingly prospects (not that the T-D Man doesn't still want to elevate Stephen to royalty, just that this prophecy has nothing to do with it).  The chapter ends abruptly.

**Chapter 48 - The Engravings (Late February - March 1816)**

This is a weird chapter - I read the whole damn thing, then went back for a recap and couldn't seem to figure out what the takeaway was.  Mr Strange and Sir Walter Pole first discuss Strange's desire to expand his magical experiments without Mr Norrell's restrictions, to Sir Walter's chagrin.  Sir Walter has various objections to Mr Strange's desires to pursue some of the old magic, but Strange brushes them all aside. Strange publishes some of his aggressive views on magic as a preamble to a fully series of books intended to delve deeply into all things English magic, which rouses Mr Norrell to great agitation (not that he actually DOES anything about it, but boy does he bemoan the publication).  Finally, we travel with Mr Strange to a London suburb with the unfortunate name of Spitalfields that has fallen off its former glory.  Just before Strange visits a home in this town, he spies Childermass using magic to hide himself in a doorway across the street.  Childermass comes out and talks with Strange about how greatly he has vexed Mr Norrell and they enter a ramshackle home together, wherein they encounter a few French artists who are hard at work creating engravings for Mr Strange's book.  These engravings are to depict the fairy roads upon which Mr Strange has traveled in the past.  Mr Strange explains to Childermass how he has accomplished this in the past and they discuss again the conflict between Strange and Norrell with respect to English magic.  The chapter ends with Mr Strange asserting that he intends to publish his book and cast light on all portions of magic for the whole of the public to see and that there isn't anything Mr Norrell can do to stop this. Clearly, Mr Strange has not yet read chapter 50.

**Chapter 49 - Wildness and madness (March 1816)**

Mr Strange is dining with Sir Walter and Lord Portishead (am I the only one who can't hear this fella's name without thinking of the band?) and they're questioning Strange again about what he intends to pursue with respect to his magical studies.  Strange asserts that his eyes are still fixed on the fairy roads and that in order to learn more he is actively attempting to call forth a fairy and interrogate him.  Strange mentions the episode he had with the king where he was in the thrall of what he's sure is a fairy (he does this without name-checking the king; Strange is decent like that).  Strange muses that maybe he needs to be a little bit crazy in order to commune with the fairies.  His compatriots aren't on board with the whole ""be more crazy to get more magical"" plan.  And so ends the chapter.

**Chapter 50 - The History and Practice of English Magic (April to late September 1816)**

Strange decides to take a holiday (that's what they call a vacation in England, right?  a ""holiday""?  Like the Madonna song?).  Anyway, while he's away, his publication, ""The History and Practice of English Magic"" is flying off the shelves, yet it has zero reviews on Goodreads.  Turns out that this is due to a propensity of the books to disappear from the homes of those who have purchased them before they can be read.  Those copies that are located still at the booksellers are also lacking in readability, inasmuch as they turn out to have nothing but blank paper between the covers.  Turns out that Mr Norrell is the one performing this magic.  The ministers are much vexed by this turn of events (people spend a lot of time in various stages of vexation in this book), as they're sure that what Mr Norrell is doing can't be OK, but they don't really know how yet to legislate it (similar to how people reacted to file-sharing in the late 90s).  Efforts are made to contact Mr Strange in the hope that he will return and help deal with this issue, but he's off moping around Italy.  Mr Norrell, meanwhile, has more than Mr Strange's book to deal with - a cottage industry in magical items has popped up and a school of magic is also up and running.  Everyone's got a fever, and the only cure is more English magic.  

&amp;#x200B;

These were a strange batch of chapters.  I feel like every time we're right on the cusp of some momentous happenings, we spend more time in squabbles, backstory, and foreshadowing.  On one hand, I'd be ready to suggest that things are about to heat up, but I feel like I forecast that at the end of every section we read.  At this point, Strange and Norrell will bicker for seven hundred pages, then battle with the fairy for all of about a half-chapter before the book wraps up.  Can you tell I'm getting frustrated?  How are you feeling?  More sanguine than I?"
bookclub,"Jeez, guys, I'm super sorry! I just plumb forgot yesterday. 

In Chapter 8, we see Chiyo finally broken. She attempts to run away and only breaks her arm. Then she learns her family is dead or gone. She's lost her only chance to become a geisha and free herself from slavery. 

In Chapter 9, Chiyo meets the Chairman and is given hope again. Hatsumomo has been cruel to her, as always, and the Chairman finds Chiyo crying on a bridge. He stops and is kind to her, wiping away her tears and saying: 

&gt; ""Here you are... a beautiful girl with nothing on Earth to be ashamed of,"" he said. ""And yet you're afraid to look at me. Someone has been cruel to you... or perhaps life has been cruel.""

Great quote. Anyway, Chairman=hope, a chance at a new life. 

In Chapter 10, we finally get to know Mameha. All we know about her so far is she is Hatsumomo's rival. In this chapter, she offers to be Chiyo's older sister, to guide her through becoming a geisha. This is the opening to change her life and Chiyo is ecstatic. 

Alright, so that is a recap of what we read. I love how each chapter is dedicated to these big turning points. It keeps me engaged and wanting to read. This book certainly is readable. 

What do you think? How are you find it? "
bookclub,"The plot seems to be ramping up here again, and we’ve heard some more about bells (remember I asked you guys to keep an eye out for bells early on?). Arabella Strange is acting a bit odd, like Mrs. Pole, and everyone who seems to matter in this society has been dismissing them both.

**Chapter 43: The curious adventure of Mr. Hyde**

Mr. Hyde, one of Jonathan Strange’s neighbors, goes up a hill in a snowstorm, hears some bells (which we are reminded are fairy attractants and repellants), and then sees Mrs. Strange wandering around in a black shift. But when he runs to Mr. Strange’s house, he finds her safe. Strange has seen all sorts of weird things, but he puts this one up to Hyde being drunk.

Mrs. Strange’s brother Henry arrives. It turns out that magic gives him the creeps. He does not get along with Strange.

Mr. Hyde comes back and says he’s seen Mrs. Strange running around the hills again. This time, she’s missing! We get a hint that maybe she’s attending some kind of ball….

After a lengthy search, she reappears wearing a black gown.

**Chapter 44: Arabella**

Everyone is in an uproar. Mrs. Strange is standing in a puddle of water, but nothing is wet. Her maidservant takes her up to bed, and the next day she complains about pain, but the doctor finds nothing wrong with her. Then, uh, she dies.

**Chapter 45: Prologue to The History and Practice of English Magic**

An interesting aside—hopefully some needed background for something happening in a bit?—about the Raven King’s first invasion of England. He comes from the north of England, a little human changeling prodigy of 15, with lice and having never having seen a spoon before, but having developed what will become English magic. It seems that English magic isn’t really English magic.

Can we make some observations about north vs south here? The Raven King magic seems to come from the north, and so does Mr. Norrell. Strange lives on the Welsh border, which I don’t *think* qualifies as the north of England. How is he different?

**Chapter 46: “The sky spoke to me…""**

Back to Hanover-square. Childermass is seeing things! Someone is doing magic! He does some of his own to find it, and has this wild hallucination where a lady magician shoots him. When he wakes up, having been shot, Norrell yells at him for using magic and says it was only Lady Pole. Evidently she got the keys for the gun drawer from Stephen Black. This has to be the thistle-down man’s doing.

Childermass thinks he’s seen something enormously frightening (namely, a bigger, powerful kind of magic), Norrell gets angrier with him, and then Norrell tells him that Mrs. Strange is dead.

So. What do we think is going on? I suspect that Mrs. Strange isn’t actually dead; something’s been going on with the thistle-down man, and we don’t know the rules for it yet. This big magic that Childermass saw may or may not be the Raven King’s magic, but seems to echo the king’s roads that Strange took off down awhile ago, and that scared Mrs. Strange so badly. Without spoiling (for those of you who have read ahead), what are your theories?"
bookclub,"Hello all! This time we are reviewing chapters 4-7. 

In Chapter 4, I notice we get an idea of why these girls become geisha: For most, it was the only option open to them. Pumpkin made it incredibly clear that she was grateful for the opportunity. We also see Hatsumomo behaving like a giant bitch, but I don't see any reason for this. It doesn't make sense to me that she would be jealous of a 9-year-old girl, so what is her problem? Any insight into this would be appreciated. 

In Chapter 5 we have more of an interplay between Chiyo and Hatsumomo. We also get an idea of how far everyone goes to help Hatsumomo earn money and maintain her appearance. I don't understand why Mr. Bekku had to come to tie the obi instead of one of the maids doing it, but she does sound beautiful. 

In Chapter 6 we meet Hatsumomo's boyfriend. This seems to be a big thing, since any time she spent with him takes money from the okiya. We also see a bit of the interplay within the okiya. The geishas are charged for every single thing during their stay. This is a debt that seems impossible to cast off. Hatsumomo seems intent on dooming Chiyo to a life of hell. Finally, we find out where Chiyo's sister is. 

And in Chapter 7 we see Satsu again, who has been living as a prostitute. She is determined to run away and has a plan. Upon returning to the okiya, Chiyo is confronted by Hatsumomo who plays nice, gives her money, and accuses her of stealing. Chiyo reveals to Mother that Hatsumomo has been having her boyfriend visit. We definitely leave Chapter 7 with a cliffhanger, wondering how Hatsumomo is going to punish Chiyo for telling, and whether or not Chiyo will be forgiven for seeing her sister, and wanting to leave. 

By this point in the book, there should be no doubt these girls were sold into slavery. It is very clear, and they must pay their way out, something that seems near impossible. 

So, what do you expect to see moving forward? What do you hope to see? 

Looking forward to what you all have to say! "
bookclub,"Howdy y'all - I apologize for getting this up so late in the day, but I'm posting from the Midwest where it's still Wednesday by approximately twenty or so minutes and I'll just have to hope that the Labor Day festivities put as much of a crimp in your reading pace as it did mine and you'll forgive me for coming in just under the wire.  Either way, I hope that you're enjoying your read through - I know that I am!   While I find myself being more critical of the text than I would if I were just reading it casually, I'm also more engaged in the characters and their motivations than I would otherwise be, which is a neat state to occupy with a book this long - I'm really getting a sense of the characters and feeling like I'm deeply invested in them.  I hope you are too - on to the recaps!!

**Chapter 40 - ""Depend upon it; there is no such place."" (June 1815)**

Napoleon is expected to attack Belgium and so Mr Strange is needed there.  While attempting to bring forth visions of Napoleon's armies, Mr Strange comes to realize that the French are far closer to Brussels than any of his own military leaders had realized and that they (the British) are woefully out of place to make any sort of defense of the capital.  In an attempt to remove Brussels from danger, Mr Strange moves the entire city to America (which is kind of like being put in check in Chess and responding by taking your King and hiding it in your shoe).  There is some clever magic here where Mr Strange conveys messages from the Duke of Wellington, who is in Brussels, which is now in America, to his armies (who are of course still in Belgium) by means of entranced bakers and very artfully placed raindrops. I must admit that these little clever uses of magic are some of my favorite elements of this tale.  I've read dozens of stories of magicians conjuring lightning bolts out of the clear sky; I've never seen one send strategic messages by way of baked goods.

We're then plunged into the chaos of the Battle of Waterloo.  As someone whose knowledge of Napoleon pretty much begins and ends with the facts that he loves waterslides and he's a shit bowler, I can't say much about how this version compares to the actual battle, but Clarke does a good job of making most of Strange's magic stay in the realm of creating hindrances for the French army rather than any sort of Dr Manhattan-level decimation of one's foes.  This keeps things fair and obviously makes the magic fit better into the reality of what (I'm assuming) really happened.  Interestingly, there is a moment where Mr Strange is faced with the choice of whether to use magic to directly kill a French soldier - both he and the soldier hesitate when they realize that he literally holds the man life in his hands.  This hesitation allows an English soldier to swoop in and save Strange (and save Mr Strange from an act that he would have likely regretted).  That being said, after the end of the battle, Mr Strange seems to recognize the extremely fine distinction between killing a man directly and using his magic to simply cause a man to be brought to his death by another.  He goes out of his way to destroy the French cannons on his way by and I'm interested to see if Mr Strange's position on the use of magic in warfare changes henceforth.  

**Chapter 41 - Starecross (Late September - December 1815)**

Mr Segundus is back in the tale!  I nearly forgot the dear man!  He has filled his time and his pockets teaching theoretical magic to anyone who's interested.  One client asks him to visit an old house that's being sold to investigate the library to determine if there are any books worth purchasing.  One thing leads to another and all of a sudden, Mr Segundus finds himself discussing the possibility of running a school for magicians at this decrepit manor!  In the span of just two pages, we're deep in the planning stages of The Segundus School of Sorcercy and Such, but what's this?  Turns out that not everyone is a supporter of the education of the nation's youth - one day, Mr Segundus runs across Mr Childermass (Mr Norrell's servant, for those who have forgotten), who shares in no uncertain terms that Mr Norrell is entirely NOT on board with the plan.  Mr Segundus is at a loss over this turn of events, and is persuaded to take up his case with Mr Strange, who is (apparently) unmoved by the missive (at the least, he's mute on the matter).  At the end of this chapter, it appears as if the whole Professor Segundus School for Exceptional Children plan is DOA.

**Chapter 42 -Strange decides to write a book (June - December 1815)**

You'll never guess what Mr Strange has decided to do.  Mr Norrell is less than pleased at this news, as he's been mulling over the idea of writing a book for the better part of a decade (and apparently, he begrudges Mr Strange's orientation toward action in this area).  Meanwhile, our man Stephen finds himself at a rather fanciful meal with the Thistle-Down Man.  The T-D Man launches into a mad tirade against the the pair of magicians whose simple presence perturbs him to no end.  For all his bluster, the fairy seems to be genuinely unwilling to deal with the magicians face-to-face for some reason.  The T-D Man decides that his best course of action is to take steps to draw another lady into the land of Lost-hope to accompany him (Mrs Strange, presumably), partially to cause trouble and partially because he's tiring of Lady Pole (who knows a thing or two about being tired herself).  In order to accomplish this, he whisks our man Stephen away to a miserable bog in order to harvest a nice piece of moss-oak (because who doesn't love a good piece of moss-oak?).  After an uncomfortable night in the bog (and about three-quarters of a disconcerting dream), Stephen is wakened by the sound of the fairy singing and we're told that ""In the fairy's song the earth recognized the names by which it called itself.""  Not sure why I loved this bit of prose so much, but galdangit, I certainly did.  Anyway, after this brief musical interlude, our man Stephen is tasked with drawing the moss-oak forth from the ground.  After grueling hours spent accomplishing this task, we're left with an exhausted man in Stephen bearing witness to a fairy who has a plan and who believes that he has just the tools to execute it.  Cliffhanger!!


Just three chapters, but a good bit has happened.  We saw magic used in battle in a variety of ways, we faced the morality of using magic to assist battle vs using magic to actually execute another living soul (and those of us who have played RPGs were having flashbacks to the types of limitations often placed on magical character classes).  We saw the rise and fall of this tale's version of Hogwarts, which basically died in the crib (unfortunately, Mr Segundus had no Lily Potter-like protector to stand before the political version of Avada Kedavra that was fired his way).  Finally, we get to spend some time with Stephen (my favorite character, personally) and we're witness to some preparation for more fairy mischief to come.  

I enjoyed these chapters, but I'm definitely noticing some odd pacing by Clarke throughout this book - some events are here and gone in a flash, while others seem to carry on for much longer than I'd expect.  Am I alone in that sense?  How does the prose work for you all?  As much as I don't want the fairy to jack up Mrs Strange's situation, I have to admit that I'm itching for a flashpoint to strike us to some more direct action - but maybe this roundabout positioning with tons of buildup before the first punch is thrown is kind of the point.  I suppose we'll just have to keep reading and see.

bookclub,"Hello all, and welcome to our first post for Memoirs of a Geisha. A few notes first: Posts for this novel will be tagged with [MG]. If you want to post in between scheduled posts (or after), please go ahead and add this. 

Second, don't be shy about posting anything you like. If there is a quote that strikes you, a scene that causes feelings, or a question you develop, please post about it! 

Finally, I want to say I can already see this book has some difficult subject matter in it. I'm struggling personally with Chiyo/Sayuri being taken from her family. It seems like she was sold, and that just strikes a cord in my heart. I don't know what to expect going forward, but I want you all to know that if anything in this book triggers you, I'll do my best to be there for you. I'm not a professional, but I care. :) You can message the mods, or PM me directly and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. 

Okay! Now on to the book. 

So, here we meet Sayuri, the Geisha; Chiyo, the child who becomes Sayuri; Jakob, the translator who doesn't seem to have more of a role, at least not yet; and Chiyo's family. We watch as Chiyo lives a relatively happy life in poverty, and as her mother grows sick, causing that life to fill with sadness and confusion. Finally, we see Chiyo and her sister, Satsu, leave their poor village for the large city of Kyoto, where they are separated. Chiyo lives with Auntie, Mother, Granny, Hatsumomo, and several maids (including Pumpkin). We do not know where Satsu is living. 

I found that I was looking up words pretty consistently, but that may be because I know nothing of Japanese culture, so I am unable to infer meaning from context. *Zori* meant nothing to me until I looked it up and was able to learn they were shoes. Are you doing this as well? 

What do you find enjoyable so far? What do you find challenging? Is there anyone reading along who has some understanding of Japanese culture, or Geisha, who can explain some of what has been addressed in the book? If not, I'll probably focus on researching the history before our next post so I can get that for you, but let me know if you are interested! 

Looking forward to hearing from you!"
bookclub,"Hi, I am reader from Korea. With regard to the 'vegetarians' of the Han Kang, the violence seems to be much discussed abroad.

bookclub,"We're wrapping up the Poem of the Week due to waning interest in posts and voting. As of now, it's officially ended; there will be no September poems.

Thank you so much to /u/DibujEx and /u/Earthsophagus for running this project for the past six months or so. They did an absolutely fantastic job."
bookclub,"So! We’re halfway done. What are you thinking so far? We don’t seem to have really settled into a plot — I keep waiting for it to begin, but instead we get another episode. That said, I think this section signals a bit of a shift in plot, as we see Norell and Strange separate, and without Norrell holding him back, maybe Strange can do something exciting.

I will add that this is my frustration with a lot of Victorian novels; Clarke seems to be capturing all aspects of them and not just the language. Any thoughts on that?

**Chapter 36: All the mirrors of the world**

Jonathan Strange pops in on Drawlight at the house of a lady he’s been scamming, and (maybe?) concludes that business in a satisfying way that ensures everyone gets what they deserve. He’s gotten there via the Raven King’s roads through the mirrors, but walks home normally. When he gets home, he discovers that his wife and everyone else there are kind of horrified by this trip through a strange land (and the possibility of meeting with the person he saw while there), but he dismisses them and attempts to gaslight his wife the next morning about the cause of the argument.

And yet, she’s not quite right, is she? As much as I want to explore the roads myself, I’d be flipping my shit too if my loved one went off alone to check them out… but we’ve seen her deal with far scarier things in far more composed ways, and given that she’s drawn the interest of the thistle-down man, I’m not sure’s totally herself here.

We hear a lot about these roads: the shadowy person, the discarded shoes, the ubiquity of the Raven King, the ruins around them. Any clues, do you think? Could the roads be a symbol?

**Chapter 37: The Cinque Dragownes**

No one will receive Drawlight anymore! So sad. Mr. Norris feels personally hard done by, enough to recommend execution (!), and proposes an authoritarian court with himself as both the plaintiff and the judge. Strange and Liverpool are like, are you f’in’ joking.

Strange announces to his wife that he’s going to write a vicious review of a book he helped to write.

**Chapter 38: From the Edinburgh Review**

This is that review. I confess I kind of skimmed this one, sorry. Near the end there’s an interesting recounting of the Raven King’s deeds.

**Chapter 39: The two magicians**

The review has gotten a lot of attention and the magicians are watched almost like paparazzis watching celebrities. There’s speculation that they’ll be at each other’s throats, but when Strange goes to see Norrell they have an honest conversation, and Norrell begs him not to leave. Strange leaves anyway.

It turns out that Norrell planned a way different conversation with Lascelles, whoops. Lascelles convinces Norrell that Strange is now his adversary.

Strange and his wife set out for Shropshire, and Arabella visits Lady Pole again. Lady Pole tries to tell her about the thistle-down man and the ballroom but talks nonsense as usual. When Arabella goes to leave, she meets the thistle-down man and says goodbye. Later, she tells Strange that she thinks he’s some kind of German royalty. When Strange inquires about him, Mr. Moorcock says he’s never seen the man."

Wondering how a mad King might act when he’s at home in his boudoir? Curious whether anyone can trust a magician at a billiards table? Then boy do I have some chapters for you!!

**Chapter 32 - The King (November 1814)**

The King is mad.  Not mad as in ""pissed off"", but rather mad as in ""lacking in marbles"".  This is an ongoing problem for the king's sons, as they are at a loss for how to deal with his madness, especially considering the scope of his influence and what it means for royal power when the keystone is crumbling.  To address this most distressing situation, representatives of the Duke of York go to Mr Norrell to request his aid.  He declines, so they go to the OTHER English magician, Mr Strange, who, feeling very bold after his successes on the battlefield, takes on the charge of attempting to alleviate the King's madness by magical means.  Upon reaching an audience with the King, Strange observes that the King is in a very bad way.  Oddly, while the King is blind and therefore unable to see Mr Strange, he does almost immediately enter into conversation with an invisible man who appears to be The Thistle-Down Man.  Strange then conveys the King out of the castle where he's relaxing (being held prisoner), much to the chagrin of the brothers Dr John and Dr Robert Willis, who are responsible for treating (tormenting) the King.  Outside near an ornamental fountain, a bit of magic is done that send the Willis brothers running scared and leaves Mr Strange and the King free of their interference.  The only problem is, Strange is not the one doing the magic...but who is??? It's a question for another chapter.

**Chapter 33 - Place the moon at my eyes (November 1814)**

Strange is at a loss to determine who performed that bit of magic against the Willis's, but we know, don't we?  It has all the markings of the Thistle-Down Man.  After the Willis brothers' flight from the area, Mr Strange and the King are transfixed by a melody that appears to be emanating from the empty air and is leading them to a house in the woods.  With great force of will and the fortunate assistance of scarlet headwear, Mr Strange is able to resist the enchantment and is able to lift it from the King as well.  After taking his leave from the King, Mr Strange discusses some of the events with Mr Norrell and Mr Norrell shares some of the history of fairy-roads and we as readers desperately hope that all this world-building will pay off.

**Chapter 34 - On the edge of the desert (November 1814)**

We find ourselves strolling along with Stephen and ""the gentleman"" (a.k.a. the fairy; a.k.a. the Thistle-Down Man) in a wholly depressing town.  The Thistle-Down man laments to Stephen about the events of the previous chapter, when Mr Strange thwarted his efforts to send the King off to who knows where.  He explains to Stephen how these magicians are working at cross purposes to his (the fairy's) efforts to enthrone our man Stephen, and so must be considered enemies, enemies who must be defeated wholly.  We've always had a friction between Mr Norrell and the fairy, but with this chapter, we now have a direct opposition of the fairy against Mr Norrell and Mr Strange.

**Chapter 35 - The Nottinghampshire gentleman (November 1814)**

Drawlight is up to some tricks in this chapter, but he's about to be found out. Drawlight is not happy to have lost his position as chief contact to Mr Norrell, which he enjoyed while Mr Strange was off at war. With Mr Strange having returned, Drawlight has again descended in the hierarchy. But it appears that he is taking action to make the most of his somewhat reduced position. First Strange's wife tells him that a lady she knows is asserting that she (the lady, not Mrs Strange) is learning magic from Mr Strange. Mr Strange dismisses this rather lightly and goes about his day.  However, one evening, while out playing the game of billiards, a visiting gentleman from Nottinghampshire declares that he is learning magic from Mr strange by mail. Obviously, Mr strange has not, in fact, started a magic-by-mail business, and it instead appears that Drawlight is perhaps utilizing quotes and information gleaned from Mr. Strange (and likely Mr Norrell) to dupe people out of their money and pretend to teach them magic via letter. The chapter ends with Mr Strange about to demonstrate to the Nottinghampshire gentleman that his, in fact, Jonathan Strange by stepping through a mirror in the room. To where? We must await the next chapter to see, but methinks the fairy roads exposition from a few chapters earlier might actually pay off.

So the positions of our key actors are beginning to settle more definitely into place, aren’t they? I expected to see more conflict between Strange and Norrell, but their shared antagonist in the person of the fairy may keep them aligned (or, perhaps, their friction may impede their abilities to stand forth against the efforts of the fairy). What about Vinculus? How will he play into this? And poor Lady Pole? Is she getting any naps these days??? So many questions. Let’s hope these disparate threads weave into something over the next hundred pages or so."

bookclub,"Welcome back! Thanks for your patience, everyone. It’s been a long weekend.

**Chapter 29: At the house of José Estoril**

Much to Mr. Norrell’s dismay, Strange goes to Portugal with 40 of Norrell’s books, lol. When he gets there, he meets Lord Wellington, who tells him that the magicians have been a hindrance in the war. He puts off Strange for a long time, until Strange figures out they might need a better road, and gives them one. Lord Wellington is happy.

**Chapter 30: The book of Robert Findhelm**

Childermass disappears for awhile and returns with speculation about the Raven King’s book of magic. It looks like Vinculus might have it? Or his father ate it before he died? That’s left a bit open. Then we move on to Stephen Black and the thistle-down man. Turns out Stephen is going to be hte King of England, which seems improbable. He explains his history to the man and reveals that his mother never named him. The thistle-down man is incredulous and forces his help on Stephen once again: he declares that he is going to find Stephen’s true name.

**Chapter 31: Seventeen dead Neapolitans**

An important Englishman is captured! Wellington sends the War Boys from Mad Max to retrieve him. Also Strange, who brings a golem, which he swaps for the Englishman in the eventual melee.

They begin looking for some Neapolitan deserters from the French army. They find seventeen dead ones, and when Strange has exhausted all his other ideas, he resurrects them and they give up the intelligence they need. He does lots of other things, too (the chapter gets a similar fast-forward), and returns home, Napoleon having abdicated in 1814. He did that in real life, too, and was subsequently exiled to Elba, but my history isn’t good enough to tell you whether the author edited history outside of the rivers and etc.

Strange gets home to find that the thistle-down man has taken an interest in his wife… DUN DUN DUN.

Any thoughts? Anyone know more about the history than me? (I know there’s at least one of you!) Did you expect the war to be just an episode? (I didn’t!)"

So this week we'll read a poem that is quite straight forwards, but quite hard hitting for those difficult days.

[How to read a poem by /u/surf_wax](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/7h6o9s/poem_of_the_week_the_love_song_of_j_alfred/) 

## [Here's the poem](http://holyjoe.org/poetry/malloch.htm)

And the main points:

1. Initial, no-pressure read-through
2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem
3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.
4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?
5. What do you think the poem is about?
6. Favorite verses

---

### 1. Initial, no-pressure read-through

### 2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem

Honestly the first thing that caught my attention was how fun it was to read aloud, it just flowed so well. The second one is how simple and straightforward it is, there's no hidden meaning, there's no weird time changes or different speakers, there are no allusions to obscure texts or anything, it's just straightforward, the rhyme scheme is also really simple, as well as the progression.

Of course I don't believe that good poetry should be difficult to parse, so I'm not saying it as a demerit, at all.

### 3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.

### 4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?

I'm honestly lacking words to describe the poem, I find it a bit self-evident and I'm not sure if I can actually add much to it.

There's a clear comparison between trees and people, and what makes us grow. It anthropomorphizes the tree and its lack of struggle to then do the same with an actual person.

### 5. What do you think the poem is about?

Again, really straightforward. A life without struggle is ok, but does not make us grow or mature, it doesn't make us strong.

### 6. Favorite verses

&gt;Good timber does not grow with ease:
The stronger wind, the stronger trees;

bookclub,"Hi all,

Easy week today, just a formal chance to peruse the Appendices (I-IV), the Glossary, and the map, in case you haven't been referencing it. I opted to put these last to avoid spoiling earlier portions of the book.

Let me know if you have any questions about the contents of these, or if you think I should have scheduled these earlier in the read."
bookclub,"Here we are again, friends. Sorry for the delay, I'm posting from Alaska and had to wrestle my copy of the text back from a polar bear (he's loving it so far). How are you coming?  Our titular pair came together at last in the prior section and now we begin to see the interplay between the two as well as how a doubling in the number of English magicians impacts society, the war, and all the rest.  Let's dive in!


**Chapter 25 - The education of a magician (September - December 1809)**


Jonathan Strange's education begins, or at least, Mr Norrell's idea of a magician's education begins.  Much reading is in the offing for Mr Strange, but after a clumsy beginning, they find their cadence with each other and begin to enjoy, each in his own way, the community of having a fellow musician with whom to engage.  There is a curious exchange where Mr Norrell seems to go against himself with respect to imbuing magical powers into items such as rings and we find out that Mr Norrell appears to be keeping some aspects of magical learning for himself.  He is, however, generous with his contacts and he introduces Mr Strange to Lord Mulgrave, who immediately decides to utilize this new magician to manipulate the Russian Emperor by sending him dreams implying that he shouldn't trust Napoleon.  In addition, we're subjected to a meandering footnote describing the misadventures of a magical ring and various folks who encounter it.  Wasn't my cup of tea.


**Chapter 26 - Orb, crown and sceptre (September 1809)**


We return to the predicament of Lady Pole and Stephen (who, you recall, are dancing with the Thistle-Down Man every night in their dreams).  Things are grim - there are tales of tapestries of human skin, for cripes' sakes.  In addition, we find out that the Thistle-Down Man is coming up with ever-more extravagant ways to convey riches and wealth upon Stephen.  This, unsurprisingly, does little for our man - he's officially in ""my kingdom for a night's sleep"" territory, as this life-by-day/dance-by-night existence has been going on for two years' time.  Frustratingly, every time he tries to share his miseries with another, he finds himself unable to speak on the subject.  In addition, it's not helping his relationship with Mrs Brandy, his beloved.  He's so bereft that he can do little but sit and sigh in her presence, which, let's face it, is a real downer and makes him poor company.  Either way, on a walk home from visiting Mrs Brandy, Stephen is assailed by gifts of (you guessed it) an orb, a crown, and a sceptre, after which he stumbles into the company of the Thistle-Down Man, who is casting aspersions down upon the unaware head of Mr Norrell.  We finish with another tale of horrors visited upon innocents by the Thistle-Down Man (who is REALLY not a nice guy).


**Chapter 27 - The magician's wife (December 1809 - January 1810)**


Here we find Mr and Mrs Strange paying a visit to Sir Walter Pole to discuss how Mr Strange might be of assistance in the continuing war.  During their visit, Mrs Strange stumbles across Lady Pole and they discuss (as much as Lady Pole is able) the difficulties Lady Pole is suffering.  Mrs Strange is aware that something is amiss with Lady Pole and she takes it upon herself to do what she can to assist.  


**Chapter 28 - The Duke of Roxburghe's library (November 1810 - January 1811)**


Jonathan Strange is called to assist with a ship that has run aground.  Unfortunately, he's not well versed in seafaring and is a bit lost as to how to provide aid.  However, he strikes upon a way to assist and gives the Ministers the idea that he would be quite helpful closer to battle, where his magical talents could be called upon readily.  Mr Norrell is, unsuprisingly, not on board with this plan.  However, Drawlight and Lascelles leverage an imminent auction of the Duke of Roxburghe's library to motivate Mr Norrell to want Mr Strange out of the vicinity (as Mr Norrell wants all magical texts from this library for himself), thereby removing Mr Norrell's objections to the travels of Mr Strange.  In addition, we find out that during the auction, Mr Norrell is particularly merciless in his bidding against Mrs Strange, which may come back to impact his relationship with Mr Strange.


Honestly, I didn't find this to be the most eventful section.  We get some slight development in the plot of the Thistle-Down Man and his ""victims"", we learn about Jonathan Strange's initial training, and we see a bit of a wedge forming between Strange and Norrell, which might do something plot-wise.  Overall, however, I wish I had more to say here, but the plot and themes here felt light.  What do you think?  Am I wrong?  What did you think of this section?"

bookclub,"Welcome back! I’m posting this by the seat of my pants; it’s after 6pm on the west coast. I’ll do better next weekend, when I’m less busy.

**Chapter 21: The cards of Marseilles**

Vinculus, the semi-scammy magician, and Childermass, Norrell’s dude, go have a drink together in a seedy bar. Childermass tells his fortune, Vinculus tells Childermass’s, then Vinculus tells Norrell’s. Something is Up with this deck, first we find out that Childermass drew some of it from memory, and then there are extra cards. The author has set us up to believe that there’s something to Vinculus, he’s not just a charlatan. Even Norrell takes him a bit seriously, despite his distaste. He wants this book, and sends Childermass to find it, but Childermass only finds V’s five wives.

I suspect you’d get a little extra out of this chapter if you knew yourself some tarot. I don’t. Sorry!

**Chapter 22: The Knight of Wands**

The Knight of Wands is the guy that Vinculus is supposed to deliver his message to, and the chapter opens with Jonathan Strange. Hm. His father has just died and he doesn’t seem to miss him much. He’s also got a girlfriend who thinks he needs some direction in his life. With his father’s abused manservant, he goes to ask his girlfriend to marry him, but encounters Vinculus in a bush along the way. V gives him the prophecy and sells him the spells he got from Childermass.

He does a spell to discover his enemy, and discovers a 50ish-year-old man in a gray coat. Norrell?

**Chapter 23: The Shadow House**

John Segundus visits a house and has a dream… and it turns out that the guy from Strange’s spell is him! Strange is super rude to him, but he doesn’t make him an enemy just yet. He’s gotten pretty good at magic, and Honeyfoot and Segundus recommend him lots of books. They also suggest that he go and offer himelf as an apprentice to Mr. Norrell.

**Chapter 24: Another magician**

Mr. Norrell finds out that there is another magician, and he pouts about it for awhile. His first meeting with Strange is *suuuuuper* awkward. Arabella points out to Strange that Mr. Norrell probably needs someone to argue with, lol, and Norrell wants to keep Strange close to keep some power over him. On their second meeting, Strange does some magic. Norrell is smitten.

What did you think of this bit? This meeting has been a long time coming. Were you able to make better sense of the dreams and the tarot than I was?

And please check out /u/VillainousInc’s [great history post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/98ci0d/the_next_three_years_1808_1810_jsmn/), which puts all this in some better context for us."
bookclub,"You guys, can you believe it's almost September? It's been so hot here, autumn can't come fast enough.

Mid-August means it's time to decide on our poems for September. We missed a weekend this month, so we'll pick four poems for August instead of five.

Please, nominate several poems, including any that didn't get selected last time that you still want to see us do! One poem per comment so voting is easy, just like we do for novels. The only requirement is that the poem is freely available online (please provide a link), wasn’t written by you or your best friend, hasn't been done before, and isn’t super long — let’s use Christina Rosetti’s “Goblin Market” as a benchmark and keep it to ~575 lines or below for now. Aside from that, anything goes: any period, any poet, free verse or structured.

Voting will close on the evening of 8/25. Happy voting!"
bookclub,"Rather than write a thread for each year, I've opted to consolidate into sensible segments of time. This decision was aided by the fact that both 1808 and 1809 are only briefly represented in the book. I'll forego any further preamble and commence presently.

In the early months of 1808, the previous year's prohibitions on the foreign slave trade in both the United States and Great Britain come into effect. While the effect on England and its territories is considered to be dramatic, the United States found it had an amble supply to maintain the practice through domestic trade for several decades yet. Meanwhile, Napoleon's armies have occupied the Papal States in the northern half of Italy, continuing their domination, and the Russians, now tentatively allied with Napoleon, move against Finland, while also threatening Sweden to extort its cooperation in the blockade strategy against England. Napoleon has also run the Portuguese royal family off the continent, and they retreat to Brazil, making it the seat of their empire.

The Peninsular War begins with revolution in Madrid, and this and the Finnish War turn hot. Though the body of England remains secure, the nation's allies are beset and embattled.

At the same time, the world itself grows a little colder as a mysterious volcanic eruption in the west Pacific causes the air temperature to drop for the next decade. 

Across the ocean, James Madison is elected the fourth president of the United States, and is sworn into office in March of the following year.

By the end of the year, Russia has annexed Finland, and Napoleon himself arrives in Spain to join his armies.

Down but not out, in 1809, the former Holy Roman Emperor Francis II, now styled Francis I of Austria, declares war once more on France, which . . . does not go well for him.

The steamboat is patented in the U.S., and the Supreme Court cements the power of the Federal government over individual states setting the stage for a litany of conflicts over that same issue that continue to this day.

Sweden's Gustav IV is ousted by military coup for his ineptitude in the disastrous Finnish War, and is eventually forced to abdicate and enter exile. The Riksdag, a governing body made up of the four 'estates' of Swedish society (the Nobility, Clergy, Burghers and Peasants) regains power for the first time since the mid-1700s, and elects Charles XIII to the kingship.

Napoleon annexes the Papal States to the French Empire, and declares the Pope's secular political power to be ended. The Pope promptly excommunicates him. Napoleon responds by arresting him (or kidnapping. It's not precisely clear.)

The Peninsular War is not going well for anyone who isn't French. The Spanish are losing battle after battle and taking extraordinary losses, and their territories in Central America are starting to break off from them as well. 

A number of extraordinary individuals are born in 1809: Abraham Lincoln, Charles Darwin, Edgar Allen Poe, Alfred Lord Tennyson, and Louis Braille. On the other hand, Meriwether Lewis took his own life.

The new decade begins with the annulment of Napoleon's marriage to his beloved Josephine, for the practical concern of her not being able to bear him an heir. He soon remarries Marie-Louise of Austria - the daughter of Francis, who having been soundly whipped again is now bound up by treaty in Napoleon's Continental System.

Some light begins to break, as the French Army retreats from Portugal. 

Not everyone is much bothered by the Napoleonic Wars - Beethoven completes Für Elise at this time.

On the other hand, the U.S. is more than a bit put out by both British and French forces seizing their ships for the war.  A law is passed essentially telling them to knock it off, by opening trade with both and promising that whomever promised to cut it out first that they'd embargo the other. This is a \*terrible\* plan. Napoleon jumps at the opportunity to agree, but without any intention of actually \*honoring\* the agreement. 

Napoleon annexes Holland, and Spanish territories are dropping out of the empire at an alarming rate now. 

In October, King George III of England is recognized as being insane, crippled by the death of his favorite daughter.

The U.S. snatches up West Florida, which has \*also\* recently broken from Spain.

As the year nears its end, a new front in the war opens up as Sweden declares war on England. Well theoretically, anyhow. This is a completely bloodless war, and Sweden doesn't actually hold up its end of the bargain with Napoleon very well, and doesn't block English ships.

The first Oktoberfest is also held this year in Bavaria, celebrating the marriage of Prince Ludwig to Princess Therese. I include this not because it's important, but because very little other good news has been included in this brief history, and we could probably all use a beer by now. 

Next Time: The Napoleonic Wars continue, but less depressingly for fans of the British and Spanish teams."
bookclub,"# A couple translations

Here's a text of the poem that doesn't have a  couple typos I saw
in poetryfoundation's copy (peep-holdes and ""to one-armed"")

http://oriana-poetry.blogspot.com/2011/10/transtromers-funeral-gondola-power-of.html

That's translated by Patty Crane; here  is another  translation by  Malena Morling:

http://thebluelantern.blogspot.com/2012/03/grief-gondola.html


# Contrasts
This poem is different from most we select: it refers to specific
minute details of history and biography in Wagner's and Liszt's old
age.  I didn't know Liszt and Wagner were related by marriage or even
that they were contemporaries.  I didn't know that in Liszt wrote
music in reaction to Wagner's death called ""Sorrow Gondola,"" referring
to gondolas used in Venetian funerals.

It's also interesting that the poem deals both with specific historic
matter and with dreams -- most lyric poetry is about non-specific but
posited as ""real world"" matter.

Let's contrast specifically with last week's poem, ""sharpens every dull"".

GONDOLA - syntax/diction are plain; SHARPENS they are peculiar.
GONDOLA refers to specific historic moments and dreams; SHARPENS to
public/waking life, but fictional setting.  GONDOLA: cataclysm, lost
predominate; SHARPENS restoration; SHARPENS is linear this-then-that,
GONDOLA disjointed, confusing.

Gondola poem is introspective, about a particular person's feeling, a reaction
to specific biography, not
something shared/universal or necessarily accessible.  Anything about Nazis also seems prophetic, Jeremiad-flavored.  Predicting more doom, the triumph of  sorrow and loss?

Within Gondola almost is about decay, misplaced power; there's the
image of Liszt summon power, becoming wizard-like as he makes music of
Wagner's death.  But that wizardry is complicity with ""deep that wants
to join humans without showing its face"" and the magic he makes  hurls
to the future and its magic explodes in the time of the brownshirts.

Most of the rest about weakness, undermining, loss
for the author.  And ""Abbé Liszt"" shows Liszt reduced, writing
letters, sucking down cognac, compared to a schoolboy with meaningless
chores, wasting language.  Wagner is defeated his face a surrender flag.

# Inventory

Similes - white flag of surrender  -- overpowered

The school with no teacher and hospital with no doctor -- authority missing.
Traditional order lost.

The newborn speaking complete sentences and hen-sized sparrow whose song
deafens -- overpowered, out of balance, regular  order lost.

The most immediately prominent image to me is that Liszt wrote chords
so heavy they sink down to the age of the brownshirts.  In case anyone
doesn't know, ""brownshirts"" were Hitler's militia, and inspired by
Italian fascists; the poem is about Germans in Italy.
Nazis/Blackshirts: overpowering, out of balance, world gone wrong.  So
this image is that artistic creation can burrow thru time and take on
significance, and its ominous: we know Hitler loved Wagner, to an
American my age that's a commonplace.

Another striking image: the dream of the newborn girl speaking in
complete sentences.  Transtromer lost speech in a stroke.  He also has
the image of playing the drawn picture of they keys ""mutely"" (or
""mute"" in the Crane translation).

Another: the image of Liszt playing the sea; he becomes to me sort
of a Neptune deity, commanding nature, Opera of the cosmos.  Overpowering,
out of balance.

# Questions

gifted cognac?  As in, given  to him as a gift?  Or cognac that
is especially talented?

Who is King Midas who turns everything he touches into Wagner?  I took
the opening lines to mean Wagner was an egocentric or charismatic, and
Cosima, Liszt's daughter, Wagner's wife, is staying with them, she is
the restless woman.

Who is the one-way?  The dead Wagner?

Two one-oared bandits?
"
bookclub,"Gurney's back! Paul begins to accept his religious mantle by changing the traditions of the Fremen and refusing to call out Stilgar. Gurney's hatred for Jessica causes Paul to realize that he is not as prescient as he thinks, spurring him to drink the unchanged water of life. When he does, he becomes something more. Greater, perhaps, than the Kwisatz Haderach, with near perfect knowledge of the future, outside of a few crucial nexuses. He sees the situation evolving in the capitol, where the combined might of the galaxy has assembled to end Paul's insurgency.

That's when fate gives the Fremen a massive storm, perfect for their assault on the Harkonnen and imperial forces. The storm shorts out the shields, and Paul uses the Atreides atomics--which he had saved much earlier in the book--to open the shield wall, allowing the Fremen worm-cavalry to sweep in and decide the battle. Oh, and Alia killed the Baron. 

At this point, Paul's terrible purpose, the jihad, might still be averted if he can arrange a marriage to princess Irulan to claim the imperial throne. Until, that is, Feyd-Rautha invokes kanly. Combat with the Harkonnen guarantees the jihad, whether he lives or dies. And just as quick as that, Paul won, killing Feyd-Rautha (but leaving his daughter), marrying Irulan, and remaining true to Chani, all in the space of about two pages, and then the book ends.

So, yes, it was like 440 pages of *not* action followed by 40 pages of rather intense action. What'd you think? Bear in mind we're also doing a full-book wrap next week, but I might make it a theme discussion if people seem to get things in this thread."

bookclub,"Here we are, twenty chapters in, and the pages are just flying by!  I hope you're all staying engaged - I suspect this is the drop-off point for those who struggle with long texts, but on a page-by-page basis, this is eminently readable, so I'm hoping that will help you to the point where you think ""hey, I'm four hundred and fifty pages into this beast; I'm finishing it, by jove"".  

**Chapter 15 - ""How is Lady Pole?"" (January 1808)**

How indeed.  Well, by all accounts, is how she is.  Her servants are another matter, as we'll see in a bit.  We also learn that the servants are all subordinate to Stephen Black (who's, well, black) and they've got it into their heads that he must be an African prince in secret, because otherwise why would they so willingly follow his leadership (right?  RIGHT??)?  Either way, urged by custom, Lady Pole puts on her first dinner-party, which goes well enough, except for a batch of strange happenings that trouble the servants, including an apparition standing over Lady Pole's shoulder, music playing in the next room, and a ghostly forest that seems to be growing just outside the building.  Strangely, these events appear only to the servants and not to Stephen or to the dinner-party hosts or guests...but we don't yet know why.

**Chapter 16 - Lost-hope (January 1808)**

Things continue to get stranger for the servants as we enter the ""middle third of Amityville Horror"" phase of the events, where some folks are thoroughly freaked and others are in full disbelief mode.  Stephen is in the latter camp, but that's all about to change, as he's called to aid a strange gentleman in a room that appears out of nowhere.  Stephen takes this all remarkably in stride, even when the gentleman (who's doing everything shy of wearing a sign around his neck stating ""BEWARE THIS WEIRDO"") displays Lady Pole's finger (remember he took that?) in a cigar box.  Presently, Stephen is whisked away to join the the Thistle-Down Man at his ball (does it count as ""whisking away"" if the ball just sort of appears around our man Stephen?) in the land of Lost-hope.  The chapter closes with Stephen dancing away at the ball that is peopled with souls who have (presumably) been lost to previous fairy-bargains throughout the years.  Things are looking ill for our man Stephen.  

**Chapter 17 - The unaccountable appearance of twenty-five guineas (January 1808)**

We open on a shop, Brandy's in St. James street.  The current owner of the shop is Mrs Brandy (late of Mr Brandy, whose death left her a grocer by inheritance).  One moonless night (aren't they always?), twenty-five guineas appear (as if by magic!) in the till of the shop.  A discussion between Mrs Brandy and her employees leads to a decision to call upon the assistance of Stephen Black (of whom Mrs Brandy is quite fond) and the decision is made to give the money over to a lawyer to avoid the appearance of impropriety in its acquisition.  Shortly after, Stephen has made his way out to the street where, by mishap, he has cause to fear that he will get caught up in a violent episode that can only end poorly for a black man in the early nineteenth century.  However, he's saved by the transmutation of everything nearby (people, dogs, etc.) into trees constituting a vast forest and he comes in a dreamlike way to the entrance to a stone house that must be the same one from the prior nights' ball (which Stephen cannot recall, BTW).  Lots going on with our man Stephen.

**Chapter 18 - Sir Walter consults gentlemen in several professions (February 1808)**

Lady Pole is not well - this is evident to all.  Sir Walter appeals to a doctor to see to her, but she is declared in full health.  Sir Walter then calls for Mr Norrell, who explains that if she is not physically unwell, there is nothing that magic can do for her either.  Mr Norrell then returns home and calls the Thistle-Down Man forth to discuss Lady Pole's state.  They quarrel about the terms of the deal that was struck, Mr Norrell insisting that he expected her time in life to be an unbroken half of seventy-five years and the fairy insisting that he agreed to no such specifics.  It would appear that the Thistle-Down Man is taking Lady Pole (and Stephen) to dance at a ball every evening, which, unsurprisingly, is leaving her with very little energy or enthusiasm for anything in her ""real"" life.  By the end of the chapter, it's clear that this situation is wearing heavily on Lady Pole, Sir Walter, and all who are associated with the unlucky couple.  

**Chapter 19 - The Peep-O'Day-Boys (February 1808)**

We return to check in on Stephen Black, who is suffering from a similar situation as Lady Pole, but who does not have the luxury of laying about complaining of fatigue and melancholy; this is a man who actually works for a living.  In an attempt to find some joy in his days, he attends a servants' club of which he is a member, known as the The Peep-O'Day-Boys.  While there, he is visited again by our fairy troublemaker, who engages in a bit of heavy-handed exposition with respect to the whole ""real world by day / dance in his ball all night"" situation that Stephen Black and Lady Pole are suffering, just in case anyone wasn't keeping up.  The Thistle-Down Man insists that he has done Stephen a great service by dragging him off to these nocturnal events and Stephen responds with appreciation and a request to be relinquished from such a burdensome gift, as it's damn tiring.  The fairy insists that he simply COULDN'T let Stephen go, as he's wildly popular among the other attendees of the the Midnight Dance Party.  He goes on to suggest that he would, however, like to bestow a kingdom upon Stephen and he casts about in his mind to come up with one that might be appropriate (dismissing such poor choices as Untold-Blessings and Pity-Me).  I suspect Stephen has never had as much trouble with a gentleman as he has had with this fairy fellow.  

**Chapter 20 - The unlikely milliner (February 1808)**

Long has the existence of false magicians vexed Mr Norrell.  Now that he finds himself in a position of influence, he moves to address it, first by petitioning to have an country-wide ban on all unlicensed magic, but he is instead forced to settle for simply insisting that it not be allowed in the city of London (hoping that the prohibition will spread outward through London's cultural influence).  This causes the voluntary exodus of all charlatans save one; Vinculus, the one ""magician"" who chafes Mr Norrell the most.  One chilly evening, Vinculus is visited by a man who asserts himself as a milliner (one who makes women's hats), but who clearly is not.  After some discussion, it becomes clear that this man is in fact Childermass, sent to use magic to drive Vinculus out of London.  Instead, however, he and Vinculus depart to an ale-house to discuss the matter and Vinculus ends up pocketing a few pages of spells drawn up by Mr Norrell.

Whew!  Lots going on!  Raise your hand if you're shocked (SHOCKED) that the bargain with the fairy has gone quite unwell (no one?).  I am hoping that there's more nuance coming on that plot-line, since right now, it's a fairly rote monkey's-paw-style path that we're on (save for the fact that Lady Pole and Stephen are paying for Mr Norrell's actions).  One thing I have to credit, however, in these chapters is the ability of Clarke to effectively sketch a character who is seemingly going to be on-stage for only a brief period.  It really fleshes out the world of the story and has done well to keep me guessing about who will pop up in the next chapter.  I'm hoping that continues.  

We also encountered a lot more discussion about class distinction and race in these chapters - thoughts?  Most of what was said struck me as fairly straightforward, but I'm up to have my mind changed on that.  You could argue that Lady Pole and Stephen suffering the burden of Mr Norrell's actions is asserting something about who pays the bill in society, but maybe that's a stretch.  Finally, is anyone else surprised to get through twenty chapters with a titular character as yet unrevealed? Startling bit of prudence, that.

bookclub,"Hey folks, sorry this is late. I had a longer write-up but I forgot to post it Friday from work, and my computer rebooted. So I'm just going to touch on some major character changes and themes briefly.

First, we finally get to meet Alia, and she is weird. Kind of makes sense since she was born a (mentally) fully mature woman with innumerable lifetimes of experience and memory.

Paul and Chani have a son, Leto II. So the Atreides line is saved.

We get a deeper look at the Harkonnen plans and find out good friend Thufir Hawat scheming away at the center of it, twisting the Baron's plans to his own ends, and setting Feyd Rautha and the baton against one another. For all the fun of Hawat's scheming, the Harkonnens remain fairly flat, serving mostly as a foil for Paul, who is gifted with foresight and the adoration of the Fremen, but who is attempting to escape his future, while the Harkonnens are plotting and scheming to win over the Fremen and achieve their vision for the future, ignorant of what is to come.

Finally, Paul is lost in time. While he can distinguish the present, his prescience is becoming frighteningly potent. He is also fully accepted among the Fremen. Already a leader because of the military training he imparts, he is also being increasingly viewed as the religious figure I think he desperately hopes not to be. But we shall see.

The storm is gathering."

bookclub,"So! Picking up from /u/Jon_Matrix's masterful updates on [Chapters 5-8](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/95sz99/jonathan_strange_and_mr_norrell_chapters_58/). Things got more interesting in that section, and if I wasn't hooked before, I'd be hooked by now. The week got away from me and I left this until the last minute, but it wasn't even a little bit of a chore, I'm liking this book so much.

**Chapter 9: Lady Pole**

This is the wrap-up for Miss Winterhouse’s resurrection, though Clarke has set us up to expect that this won’t be the last we see of her or the thistle-down man. She’s totally fine, minus the loss of her finger (as far as we know, as everyone keeps pointing out), and seems to have recovered from her tuberculosis. What’s more is that Pole seems to have unexpectedly fallen in love with her, and it looks like he’s going to be annoying her incessantly with his great big man opinions for the next 32.5 years or so.

One of the things I wanted you guys to keep an eye on was the oppression of women, people of color, etc. I think this is a bit of a starting point. We have Pole trying to marry her when she’s weeks away from death just to get to her money — in an earlier chapter, we see her hacking away in the corner while everyone uncomfortably pretends she’s fine. Then, when she dies, instead of leaving her to rest in peace, the menfolk make a bid to bring her back, casually agree on 75 more years of life for her, and sell away half of that. And they don’t know exactly what they’re giving away; they could be consigning her to something horrible. What if she’s not okay with that? No one ever thought about her opinion. But it’s not really about Miss Winterhouse, is it? It’s the financial convenience and the magic opportunity she represents.

**Chapter 10: The difficulty of finding employment for a magician**

Pole and the rest of London’s politicians now think that Mr. Norrell is the bees’ knees and try to come up with some ideas for how he can help in the French war.

**Chapter 11: Brest**

We get a bit of a cold open about how they finally decided upon using Mr. Norrell, who has created an illusion to fool the French into thinking all of their ports are blockaded by more warships than currently exist. Upon investigation, the French discover that the ships are made of rain. I loved this chapter a lot, it’s nearly its own little short story.

**Chapter 12: The Spirit of English Magic urges Mr. Norrell to the Aid of Brittania**

Mr. Norrell is a bit of a hero. As an important man, he’s got a lot of big opinions, and his two hangers-on encourage him to publish them in periodicals. He’s not sure about that until an entire periodical is created to be devoted to *him*.

**Chapter 13: The magician of Threadneedle-street**

Vinculus, a scammy street magician with a weird tattoo, comes to bestow a prophecy upon Mr. Norrell. Seems unlikely, right? But check this out, from Chapter 1:

&gt; “Three years ago,” [Mr. Segundus] said, “I was in London and I met with a street magician, a vagabonding, yellow-curtain sort of fellow with a strange disfiguration. …He told me that one day magic would be restored to England by two magicians.”

HMM. Anyway, he tells Mr. Norrell something mysterious-sounding that’s formatted like a poem and all in italics, so I bet that’s important later. Mr. Norrell is super mad. Vinculus repeats the bit about the slave with the silver crown who’s a king in a strange country. Is this the Raven King? Or is it the man with the thistle-down hair? From that chapter:

&gt; “…a tall, handsome person with pale, perfect skin and an immense amount of hair, as pale and shining as thistle-down.”

**Chapter 14: Heart-break Farm**

Jonathan Strange finally makes an appearance outside the footnotes! He’s the beloved grandson of a wealthy family in Scotland, and his father’s an enormous jerk. The chapter focuses on a manservant who’s new to the Strange household and loses his temper with the master. The elder Strange sends him on a weird errand to a dead guy who Strange supposedly ruined. Strange freezes to death that night while tormenting the manservant, lol.

We don’t learn much about Jonathan, other than that he’s a bit spoiled and conceited but not the monster his father is.

What did you think of this bit? Any predictions about what’s going to happen? Do we think Jonathan Strange will wind up having extremely red hair, like the guy the thistle-down man expected to see with Norrell? I’m seeing a bunch of narrative threads I think will be picked up later in the story. What about themes? Share your thoughts!"
bookclub,"It's nearly time to choose a September read! I don't know when exactly /u/inclinedtothelie will post another nomination/voting thread, but I imagine it will happen sometime next week or this weekend. Since I became a mod here, I’ve sat through a fair few nomination threads and watched how the votes pan out. I want to give you a couple of tips on setting your nominations up for success.

1. **Nominate early.** The same day that the thread is posted, if possible. The earlier you get your nomination in, the more eyes will pass over it, and that’s more opportunity for people to vote for it. I’ll try to keep posting 24- or 48-hour notices to minimize this effect. Don't let it stop you from nominating should you come in a day or two late, though, because there's a lot more you can do to give yourself an edge.

1. **Write a blurb about the novel in your nomination.** I’m guilty of not doing this unless I *really* want the book and assume people don’t know it. This is your first chance to build hype for it, though, and there are plenty of people checking us out who are not yet well-read or know what to expect from Thomas Hardy or Toni Morrison. A comment with a quick note saying that *To Kill a Mockingbird* was a coming-of-age about moral responsibility set in 1930s Alabama narrated by an 8-year-old would probably get more upvotes than a comment just listing the title and author.

1. **Write a campaign post.** We get relatively few people campaigning for nominations, but I saw *Jonathan Strange* soar ahead after I posted. I didn’t think it would have a big/any effect! Explain why you want us to read the book, what it’s about, what you think we could get out of it, and, most importantly, *post a link to the original voting thread and explain that’s where people should vote*. I failed to do this right off, and before I corrected it, I got something like 35 upvotes on the campaign post and maybe five on the actual comment that mattered.

1. **Don’t despair if your book doesn’t make it!** You can always renominate or read it on your own. I’m working my way through some failed nominations now.

Good luck!"
bookclub,"Hey!

So a small update. Last week we sadly did not have the poem of the week, sorry about that, we had it all lined up but something came up at the last minute.

We will not ignore it, though, and probably do it next month with the mods' consent, of course.

But for now let's get into this week's poem.

[How to read a poem by /u/surf_wax](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/7h6o9s/poem_of_the_week_the_love_song_of_j_alfred/) 

## [Here's the poem](https://allpoetry.com/who-sharpens-every-dull...)

And the main points:

1. Initial, no-pressure read-through
2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem
3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.
4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?
5. What do you think the poem is about?
6. Favorite verses

---

### 1. Initial, no-pressure read-through

### 2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem

Well, I don't know about you, but the first thing that caught my eye was the lack of capitals, not only on the poem, but on the name of the author too! This is deliberate, but why? what for? Also, of course, the lack of punctuation. I'm no poet and I'm only an aficionado at reading poetry, so I cannot talk in depth about it, but it definitely creates something, especially in lines like:

&gt;maids mothers widows wives

What do you think?

As for the mood of the poem, I would say it's... kind of nostalgic? Melancholic but in a good way? Not sure how to describe it exactly.

### 3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.

### 4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?

As far as I can tell, superficially it's about a sharpener? I'm not sure if what I'm imagining is correct since I've got another culture, but I'm guessing it's making the metaphor with those knife-sharpeners that go around homes.

But of course, this isn't someone that sharpens knives.

### 5. What do you think the poem is about?

I'm not actually sure. From a ""literal"" stand point, I think the two first lines could summarize the whole:

&gt;who sharpens every dull   
&gt;here comes the only man

But is it talking about something in specific?

The poem kind of reminds me of Gabriel García Márquez with his magic realism, where as far as I can tell the world is just weird (magic) with no rhyme or reason (most of the time) for it.

Maybe it's just simply about somebody or something that makes life just plainly better. But I don't know.

### 6. Favorite verses

&gt;he sharpens is to am  
he sharpens say to sing  
you'd almost cut your thumb  
so right he sharpens wrong  

What do you think? I feel like I'm missing something completely obvious."
bookclub,"As I didn't have a lot to write on the book itself this time, and given my love of research, history and information I thought I'd take a moment to write up a quick contextual summary of the world at the time of the story. As we grow more distant from any given time period, it can be hard to quickly associate a year to the reality of that time. I hope this reference may be helpful.

In August of 1806, Francis II Holy Roman Emperor, having been defeated by Napoleon's forces, abdicates the throne and dissolves the empire. In September, in the United States, Merriweather Lewis and William Clark return to St. Louis having completed their famous expedition. Napoleon Bonaparte is dominant across the world, expanding the First French Empire and taking on every challenger. The Napoleonic Wars are in full swing, and it seems a very poor time to be an aging empire.

As the new year, and our story, begin, the Prime Minister is William Grenville but he will soon be succeeded by the Duke of Portland, William Cavendish-Bentinck who previously held the office 24 years prior. 

Where Napoleon's armies march against Prussia and Russia, the English side of the conflicts is a game of blockades and trade embargos, and as if the economic impact of that were not enough the United Kingdom, and with the United States following suit, abolishes the foreign slave trade, though the practice of slavery itself will continue for many years. As a result one of the great British trading companies, the Sierra Leone Company lingers on the brink of collapse and sells its assets to the crown.

In the U.S., though acquitted already on charges of conspiracy, former Vice President Aaron Burr - the man who shot Alexander Hamilton - is indicted on charges of treason for what is viewed by President Thomas Jefferson as an attempt to create an independent nation on the North American continent. Burr is again acquitted, in part because of the onerous burden of proof required to prove the highest crime, but his political career is destroyed, and he leaves for Europe in self-imposed exile, and in hopes of gaining support, first from England in 1808 and then Napoleon, for a revolution in Mexico. He is denied by both, and sent packing.

Meanwhile, in July, the last Stuart claimant to the English throne dies, and the Jacobite movement ends, and the first patent for an internal combustion engine is awarded by Napoleon.

And having defeated Prussia and Russia both, a peace settles on the continent for a time, though the Napoleonic Wars will reignite by 1809 and continue for years to come.


If this was helpful or interesting, let me know. I can continue this as the years progress in the book if there's an interest in it. (A quick glance says the narrative runs through 1817.) I can also provide some context around the dates related to some of the footnotes, if anyone has any special requests.

For my part, I can't find much that deviates in the book so far from the world as history remembers it. The political figures in England seem to be about right, at least. The only real difference is that there is magic, and history remembers there being magic so there's some additional historical figures related to that. I do wonder if Mr. Norrell, having now proven his magic, might be allowed to change the course of the war, which would significantly affect the history going forward from here.





"
bookclub,"Warmest greetings all – I’m your co-read runner and am already truly enjoying my read through this tale (and I hope you are as well).  While u/surf_wax is revisiting this tale, it’s my first time through, so I’ll be representing for those of us who have yet to be ensconced in the magical (or not) era of 19th-century England.  

**Chapter 5 – Drawlight (Spring to Autumn 1807)**

In which we encounter Mr. Drawlight, who is intent upon aiding Mr. Norrell in his efforts to become acclimated to London existence, but not necessarily out of anything other than vanity.  In addition, we are assailed by many-a-many-a footnotes detailing the deeds and misdeeds of various and sundry faeries and false magicians. One note here that looks like it may foreshadow future events – it doesn’t appear that interactions with faeries end well for those involved.  Might a character in our tale learn this lesson for himself?
Note that in a footnote on page 59 (hardcover edition), we also see Jonathan Strange referred to as “Mr. Norrell’s pupil” and are informed that a book entitled *Life of Jonathan Strange* was written by John Segundus in 1820, just 13 years after the events of the current chapter.
Finally, we learn that Mr. Norrell is intent upon lending magical aid to England against France and that he has found a way to offer his services to England through a familial connection that links him to Sir Walter Pole, a Minister.

**Chapter 6 – “Magic is not respectable, sir.” (October 1807)**

Sir Walter Pole is brought to life with some truly delightful descriptions (chief among these is a description of his “two little stubby eyebrows like very small fish swimming bravely in a great sea of face.”).  We also learn of Sir Walter’s deplorable financial situation, which is on the cusp of being aided via a well-chosen marriage partner (who we’ll encounter shortly).  We’re also witness to Mr. Norrell’s introduction to Sir Walter, as well as Mrs. and (just barely so) Miss Wintertowne, who is revealed to be the bride-to-be of Sir Walter.  Mr. Norrell earnestly offers his assistance to Sir Walter (and, by extension, the entirety of the British fighting force) but is gently (yet firmly) rebuffed.  We find him at the close of the chapter lamenting this failed exchange with Mr. Drawlight, who is not put out at the least to hear of this turn of events.  

**Chapter 7 – An opportunity unlikely to occur again (October 1807)**

We open upon a tragedy – Miss Wintertowne has expired!  And only two short days prior to the wedding that was to be the salvation of poor Sir Walter’s checking account!  However, this occurrence may aid our dear Mr. Norrell, as it presents him an opportunity to demonstrate a truly powerful brand of magic in the rousing of the little miss from the land of the dead.  Drawlight is (of course), fully on board with this reanimation plan, provided that it is completed in such a manner as to provide the broadest possible advertisement of Mr. Norrell’s powers (and Drawlight’s own proximity to the same, we can be sure).  As the chapter closes, Mr. Norrell (with Drawlight and Mr. Lascelles, who’s just along for the ride) is ushered into the bedroom where the recently deceased lady is lying in repose. 

**Chapter 8 – A gentleman with thistle-down hair (October 1807)**

Just as quickly as they were ushered in, Drawlight and Lascelles are shunted right back out of the room by Mr. Norrell, who demands complete solitude in which to work his incantations.  After clearing the room, Mr. Norrell summons forth a fairy and, in a slightly off-kilter manner, enters into a bargain for the life of Miss Wintertowne to be extended by seventy-five years, half of which will be promised to the fairy (it’s implied that the rest is hers to do as she will).  In addition, the fairy expresses surprize that Mr. Norrell is alone, exclaiming that he was expecting Mr. Norrell to be accompanied by a conceited man with red hair and a long nose (who is apparently Mr. Norrell’s best friend) – is this to be Jonathan Strange?  We then move outside the lady’s bedroom and await, along with Drawlight and Lascelles, the outcome of this exchange.  In relatively short order (although not so short if you ask Mr. Drawlight, which no one did), Mr. Norrell exits the bedroom and makes it plain, with little fanfare, that Miss Wintertowne has been returned to a living, breathing state.  However, at the end of this ordeal (and the chapter), we come to learn that the fairy has apparently taken the lady’s little finger as a memento of the promise made, which is appropriately ominous.

How did this section go for everyone?  As a first-time reader of this book, I’m really (REALLY) enjoying the writing and sense of humor.  I laughed out loud at Drawlight and Lascelles reaction to Mr. Norrell’s first suggestions that he could raise the lady from the dead and the pair’s discussion of how ominous (or not) the tolling of half past one might be was a joy to witness.
First-time readers, how do you think the bargain with the fairy will impact future events?  Will Mr. Norrell come to regret it?  Will Miss Wintertowne?
Finally, how long do you suspect we’ll be forced to wait before the other half of the titular pair finally takes the stage?

bookclub,"Welcome to our discussion of *Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell*! I’m writing to you from the long-ago time of Wednesday the 1st. Before we start, I want to give you a whole bunch of stuff to be on the lookout for; it’ll be like an Easter egg hunt.

* North vs south
* Sanity vs insanity
* The dynamics of power and how those in power push down those not in power
* Manners

There are other themes, too; please don’t be afraid to remark on them! I’m wondering if we can find archetypes and tropes from 19th century literature. Wikipedia cites the Byronic hero, for one.

This book doesn’t require that you know much about early 19th century English history, though I think it probably helps, and I don’t think I’m going to be filling in a lot of missing pieces here. Do we have anyone who can help us distinguish where the book parts from reality?

With that, let’s go:

**Chapter 1: The Library at Hurtfew**

There are magicians in England, who exist solely to study the *former* magicians of England who did actual magic, something like an armchair anthropologist who never gets his feet dirty in the field. When a guy named John Segundus asks them why, some of them are taken aback (hint: manners), though he gets one ally, Mr. Honeyfoot, to help him find the answer to the question.

They go to the library of a reclusive, vaguely dickish magician named Mr. Norrell. After a confusing journey through the house in which it’s heavily implied that magic is being done, find a treasure trove of books of practical magic—how to practice it, not the less valuable histories that they’re used to reading. They put their question to Mr. Norrell, and he tells them that it’s a stupid question because he’s a practicing magician.

**Chapter 2: The Old Starre Inn**

Honeyfoot and Segundus repair back to the magicians’ club to share this news, but the other magicians spend the whole time throwing shade, and it’s implied that H and S were under some sort of enchantment to prevent them from remembering much about Norrell’s library. The main antagonist writes to Norrell and gets a snippy letter in response, saying *maybe* he’ll give them a demonstration. Keep the concept of manners in mind for this section as well—it’s interesting how much effort is put into rudeness here and how readily it’s masked as politeness.

A lawyer arrives and draws up an agreement. If Mr. Norrell fails to perform magic, he’ll stop saying he’s a magician; if he does magic, the York society will disband itself. A time and place is set for the demo. On the day of, we meet Mr. Childermass (again).

**Chapter 3: The stones of York**

We learn that bells “often went with magic and in particular with the magic of those unearthly beings, *fairies*,” so I guess keep an eye out for bells in the future. (I read this 14 years ago, I don’t remember if it’s a clue or not.) Anyway, bells sound, a voice starts speaking, then there’s a clamor of voices, and it turns out that all the statues and stones are talking. Also they scare a nearby worker, whoops(?).

Childermass asks Segundus if this will make the London paper, and S doesn’t think so. Again with the manners here, as he seems to be hinting that S should write a letter and make it happen. The society is disbanded. Honeyfoot finds a project to tide him over. Segundus is now one of only two magicians in Yorkshire, and he learns then that Mr. Norrell is going to London (remember north and south).

**Chapter 4: The Friends of English Magic**

Norrell is going to London to bring magic back to England, and the newspaper article sort of heralds him. He is kind of a big deal. He gets invited to an enormous party, which is terrible, and like many of us would, he finds a book. Turns out lots of people are making up lots of lies about him, which he overhears while trying to avoid them.

He speaks up and introduces himself to someone lying about him. (Notice the recovery here, how the small man rugsweeps his lies.) Norrell is capable of sophisticated magic, but he seems somewhat naive in the ways of the world, and continues to be astonished that people are gossiping about him.

—

So. What do you think? Are you finding the novel readable? Is it keeping your interest? How do you like the humor? I am falling head over heels in love again, and enjoying this closer read. What do you think of Mr. Norrell? When do you think we’ll meet Jonathan Strange? What have you found to discuss so far?"
bookclub,"Once again, lots of things happened in this section. I'm starting from ""My father, the Padishah emperor, was 72 years old..."" because I wasn't clear enough about start/end points last week. The sidebar is updated, though, and should be accurate--only one book (two weeks) left! Do you think you know where the plot is going yet?

So, Paul kills Jamis and becomes a man, but not a killer. This fight is mirrored in Feyd-Rautha's fight, a couple of chapters later. Paul is supported by his mother, who is silenced and unable to help him. He fights a fair fight against a less-skilled opponent, but enters it full of uncertainty and confusion, and emerges humbled and saddened, and definitely not a killer. Feyd-Rautha, on the other hand, fights nominally supported by his father, who spends the fight talking to allies, fights an unfair fight against a (likely) stronger opponent, enters the triangle full of confidence and clarity, and emerges proud and emboldened, and probably a killer. The emperor sends Count Fenrig to reign in Baron Harkonnen, but finds him slipperier than expected. The Bene Geserit aim to secure Feyd-Rautha's genetic material, and, in the words of the Fenrigs, we see that Feyd is a good foil for his cousin, Paul. Jessica becomes a Sayyadina, ingesting the Water of Life, a potent spice-based drug with mind- and time-altering properties, and changing it with Bene Geserit powers far beyond what we have seen before, which may only be available *because* of the very drug she ingested. She purifies it, removing the toxicity, so that it can be shared among the sietch for an...orgy. Also, we get a glimpse into the history of the Fremen--a long tradition of oppression dating back across worlds, including Salusa Secundus, the Emperor's prison planet and the source of the Sardukar. And then Paul gets a girlfriend by way of her seeing a vision of herself with him, which violates, like, every rule of time travel and precognition, but...space magic. And fine, it *probably* would have happened anyway, but who has time for courtship rituals in sci-fi novels, right?

More and more in this section we see Paul grappling with this specter of war in his future. We can see now that it's a holy war originating with the Fremen, and that it is somehow sparked by Paul and his mother, but we're not sure why it will be so brutal, nor how it will come to pass that the Fremen become a galactic fighting force. Or even how one would have a galaxy-wide conflict, considering that the Spacing Guild is one of the main (only?) means of space travel and, as they say, war is bad for business. I do get the sensation that Paul's vision is becoming clearer, though, and especially now that he's ingested a massive dose of spice, I'm curious to see what becomes of his powers now.

So what are your thoughts? What is still confusing to you? Who's your favorite character so far, and why? How do you think the book is going to resolve? Because I don't think that we've been given a really good hint of the ending yet, in spite of all the prescience flying around."

bookclub,"Wow. This story has just hit me hard. I mean, I knew going in that it would be challenging to look into the past at the way black people were treated in America, but I did not realize how awful it would be. 

By the end, I truly came to believe that Henrietta's family wanted to know the truth, even when it was difficult. We have all learned difficult lessons, right? Sometimes the most difficult lessons were the most essential to our healing. 

Okay, so I am looking at the overall book. 

* The science: I loved learning about the science side of everything! I was not confident in my biology skills going in. I did not feel at any time like she was talking down to me, or like she was speaking above my head. I really feel like I learned a lot about cells and the cell history. 

* The family: That family went through hell. No one should have been abused to blatantly, been refused fair wages, refused proper healthcare, treated like insignificant pieces to their scientific puzzle. Yes, science is important, ***so*** important, but that does not invalidate the importance of the humans involved. 

 * Deborah: She went through hell for these answers. She insisted she wanted them, repeatedly, turned and ran away, and then came running back time and again, despite horrible health. Even Skloot acknowledges it wasn't fair to her, and that she may not have been in her right mind as she insisted on pursuing the mystery of her mother and sister. Why do you think she tried so hard to fight through the pain for the history of her family? 

* The ethics: I think it is disgustingly wrong to for people to be forced to allow their tissues to be stored and researched on to have tests run for their health. I read an [article](https://web.archive.org/web/20080513233120/http://www.michaelcrichton.com/speech-legislativestaffers.html) that suggests we should be paid for having our tests (blood, biopsies, etc...) done because companies keep the tissues and can do research and profit off of them. What do you think of the ethics presented throughout this book? "

bookclub,"Hey!

So this week we'll talk about a old poem which I am by no means qualified to talk about, so I read a bit (wikipedia) to give some interesting points, but they are not mine and I have no idea if they are correct or even probable.

S without further ado, let's get into it:

[How to read a poem by /u/surf_wax](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/7h6o9s/poem_of_the_week_the_love_song_of_j_alfred/) 

## [Here's the poem](http://www.stoa.org/diotima/anthology/vandiver.shtml)

And the main points:

1. Initial, no-pressure read-through
2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem
3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.
4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?
5. What do you think the poem is about?
6. Favorite verses

### 1. Initial, no-pressure read-through

### 2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem

Well, apart from some words that I had to look up like ""wile"" (a trick or stratagem intended to ensnare or deceive) and ""whirring"" (to fly, revolve, or move rapidly with a whir), and the use of car for a poem so old which through me for a loop, I'm not sure this poem had much effect on me.

It's supposed to be about unrequited love, but maybe I spent too much time not being able to read it as usual that I did not find it particularly... emotional appealing, if that makes sense.

### 3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.

Well, this is translated, so I'm not so sure it matters that much, but the original was written in what is called a ""Sapphic Stanza"" because of Sappho, of course. If you care to read more there's a bit about it on the bottom of the page of the poem.

### 4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?

Now, according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ode_to_Aphrodite) (or better yet, to the sources on wikipedia) there's a small debate about what the intent of the poem is, which I think matters quite a bit when exploring what this poem is.

&gt;Classicists disagree about whether the poem was intended as a serious piece. Arguing for a serious interpretation of the poem, for instance, C. M. Bowra suggests that it discusses a genuine religious experience. On the other hand, A. P. Burnett sees the piece as ""not a prayer at all"", but a lighthearted one aiming to amuse.

Now I'm not sure how the poem is supposed to be humorous, but I'm neither a scholar nor an ancient Greek so who knows?

&gt;Ruby Blondell argues that the whole poem is a parody and reworking of the scene in book five of the Iliad between Aphrodite, Athena, and Diomedes.

Or maybe, it doesn't really matter what the intent is behind the poem, if that's so, then I think we can take it as is, a quasi story, and a sort of prayer.

### 5. What do you think the poem is about?

As said earlier, it's a sort of prayer to Aphrodite (ancient Greek goddess of love, beauty, pleasure, and procreation). It's about Sappho herself, who asks Aphrodite to come down from the heavens to help her conquer the heart of her beloved.

One thing that did jump to me, and it's not about Sappho being from Lesbos and liking women in a sexual way, it's the fact that Aphrodite talks to Sappho in the past (since this is a recounting) and tells her: 

&gt;And whom should Persuasion summon   
Here, to soothe the sting of your passion this time? 

Which means this is not the first time this has happened or that Aphrodite has come to soothe Sappho, and apparently, since Sappho is asking her again to appear, not the last time.

The other thing that caught my eye was these lines:

&gt;Now she doesn't love you, but soon her heart will    
Burn, though unwilling.""

Specially the unwilling part. It's somewhat strange, I feel, to have that written, does it mean Aphrodite forces people to love even when they actually don't want to? And does that mean Sappho is ok with that as long as their hearts long for her?

To my current-age eyes that seems a bit cruel and makes Sappho appear not as a sympathetic voice.

Although maybe I'm over reading it?

### 6. Favorite verses

&gt;Deathless face alight with your smile, 

I don't know, I kinda like how it sounds hah.

That's about it! Hope you like the poem and hopefully I've put at least one question in your mind.

"
bookclub,"So, first off, I'm really sorry for not posting last week. I got overcome by events and didn't have time to finish the selection in time, but I should probably just have said that. But instead, we're just going to do almost 100 pages' worth of Dune in one post! There's no way this could go wrong.

Also, I realize I made a mistake with the schedule so we're *not* going to discuss the final segment, ""My father, the Padishah Emperor, was 72 yet looked no more than 35 the year..."" and will instead roll that into next week's. Going forward, do include the concluding section for each week.

Hawat gets captured, Idaho saves Paul and Jessica, then Kynes, against his better judgment, saves them again, Paul navigates a storm, both metaphorical and literal, he and his mother escape a worm, cross open sand, escape another worm, meet some Fremen, and join waters with the tribe. Gurney takes up with some smugglers, Kynes is left for dead, and we learn a bit more about the spice, Dune's ecology, and the Fremen's plan for it. 

Paul's future-sight gets fleshed out a little, in contrast to his hyperawareness in its absence, but what we mostly see so far is that there are innumerable future paths and that Paul has many blind spots. Related: keep an eye out for the use of the phrase ""terrible purpose."" It's going to become more relevant.

These sections largely felt like a bridge from House Atreides to the Fremen--a liminal, or border period, where there is great opportunity for change, as is indicated by the number of nexus points, or blind spots, Paul encounters. 

As far as the new knowledge of Spice goes, I will do my best to answer questions without spoiling anything, but my own recollection of it is a little hazy so I may have to delve into r/dune posts or read ahead before answering.

So what are your thoughts? Will the Harkonnens be able to subvert Thufir? Will Gurney have his vengeance? Will Paul and Jessica survive with the Fremen? What about Paul's terrible purpose? And what about Chani? I have a question I want to ask related to her but it contains spoilers so maybe next week."
bookclub,"Hello all!

Instead of going over each chapter here like I've done so far this month, I want to talk generally about the Lacks family, and more specifically about Deborah. 

This far, as we have followed Skloot on her mission to learn about Henrietta Lacks, we have been exposed to get family in a variety of ways. We've seen what struggles the children faced without their mother, and how that affected them all as they grew up. We've watched them succeed and fail. 

In this section, we learned a lot about Elsie and the horrible conditions she lived in until her early death. 

Finally, we see Deborah struggle with the realization that her sister suffered so severely. We watch her become physical with Skloot, and we see Skloot lose her temper for the first time. 

We also got an amazing quote, that I want to address: 

&gt; Like I'm always telling my brothers, if you gonna go into history, you can't do it with a hate attitude. You gotta remember, times was different.

So, I want to know you impressions, your thoughts, and your feelings about all of this. I want to know how you see the family. "

bookclub,"Hi, everyone. I want to start by thanking /u/VillainousInc for stepping in for the last post. BIG help! I also want to remind everyone, you can make create new posts about this book at any time, regardless of what chapter you are on. The only stipulation is if you are ahead of the schedule (currently chapter 31), mark the post with a [Spoilers] tag. =D 

So, on to this post. Chapters 27-30.

In Chapter 27 we find out what probably caused Henrietta to get cancer (She had HPV-18 *and* HPV-16). In addition, we learned what allowed her cancer cells to live so long, the telomerase, which regenerated instead of deteriorating with age. In contrast, we see what her family believed caused this, with theories ranging from ""God was punishing her,"" to ""Aliens"". Did any of the theories surprise you? Does it influence the way you see the family? 

In Chapter 28 we watch as BBC interviews the Lacks family. As I read this, it seemed to mean they were prompted a lot and not listened to as much. **Disclaimer**: I have not seen the film. I did just find a [copy](https://youtu.be/R60OUKt8OGI) on YouTube specifically from Adam Curtis. I will definitely be watching that soon. From what Skloot has written, though, it seems as though the BBC wanted to portray the family in a particular way. 

Regardless, this was the first real recognition the Lacks family had received. As a result, many of the community members worked very hard to build anything that would remember Henrietta. The other side to that recognition was people wanting to con the Lackses out of any money they might be able to get from what is called a betrayal very simply throughout this section. As John Hopkins is considering honoring Henrietta Lacks, Cofield enters the scene and begins the process to con the Lackses and the hospital, leading to a lengthy and stressful legal battle for all involved. This legal battle was handled solely by John Hopkins from what I gathered (does anyone else have a different thought here?). However, they gave up the idea of honoring Henrietta formally. 

I was shocked that John Hopkins was willing to fight the legal battle at all. They could have left the Lackses to deal with it themselves, but they got rid of Cofield for the Lackses, and for Speed, the woman attempting to start a Henrietta Lack museum. What do you think of that? Do you think they were attempting to make up for past indiscretions? 

In Chapter 29 we realize just how little the Lackses have understood about Henrietta's cells. Stories of a village of Henriettas in London and the plant-people blurred the lines between Sci-Fi and reality for this family, especially Deborah. Then, after 3 days together, bonding, Rebecca sees the medical records and reaches for them, triggering Deborah to flee the room. Do you think this has anything to do with Cofield? She still could not have trusted Skloot much. She was still a white woman asking questions. Why do you think she called her the next day. 

Finally, in Chapter 30, we go to see Zakariyya (zuh-car-ee-uh) and get a flash of that anger from him as Skloot corrects the name he uses for Gey as he is talking. Do you think his anger is justified? Why do you think the picture of his mother's chromosomes had such a powerful effect on him? 

Overall, do the interactions within the family, or between Skloot and the family, influence your perception of this story thus far? How so? Do you think Skloot is taking sides at any point? How do your biases influence your perception? 

Alright, looking forward to hearing from you all! "

bookclub,"Hey guys, u/inclinedtothelie is a bit busy right now, so I'm stepping in for this section.

This is a hugely consequential part of the book wherein the Lacks family ultimately learns of the HeLa cells. Up to now the story of HeLa and the story of the Lackses have been largely separate, but here they come together. 

In Chapter 23, Bobbette is the first to learn, from an acquaintance in the medical field, of her mother-in-law's 'immortality.'  She doesn't take the news well. It struck me that the happenstance way in which the information was imparted had a lot to do with how she took it, and her anger seems to inform the rest of the family's feelings. Do you think if the news had been imparted differently, the history of the Lackses' relationship with HeLa might have been different?

We also learn about Victor McKusick and Susan Hsu, and their interactions with the Lacks family. McKusick sought to solve the HeLa contamination problem by studying the Lacks family for essential genetic markers that could positively identify HeLa cells within other cultures, but the Lackses thought he was testing them for the cancer that killed Henrietta. Here, Hsu is a very interesting character in this drama and a firmly opposed narrative of these studies to what the Lacks family recalls. Additionally, she seems to have no regrets or remorse about her part in this, and even expresses a desire to obtain more samples. Do you buy the explanation that the language barrier between Hsu and Day led to these misunderstandings, or is there an alternate explanation?

In Chapter 24, we are introduced to Michael Rogers, the *Rolling Stone* writer whose article Skloot had been reading in her hotel room when she first arrived in Baltimore. Unwittingly and indirectly, he's the first to tell the Lackses that there was money changing hands over the HeLa cell line, and this seems to be what gets the men of the family really passionate about the issue. How do you feel about money being the main motivator of their anger?

On the other hand, Deborah has very different concerns and feelings about those cells, being horrified by the ways in which what she sees as a living part of her mother have been tortured and exploited. How do you feel about her fears, and her feeling that even now her mother lives through the cells? (Even to the point of causing accidents to protect the family!)

Chapter 25, tells us of the related case of John Moore, whose removed spleen was sold for research purposes. This controversial case, which reached the supreme court, makes the matter of discarded tissue being 'fair game' settled law -- it is legal to conduct research, sell or otherwise do anything with any tissue once separated from a living person, whether that removal was consented to or not. Does knowing the legal view of the matter, and the reasons that conclusion was reached, change your view on the ethics of the HeLa case?

In Chapter 26, life continues for the Lacks family. Deborah gets remarried, and Zakariyya is released from prison. Deborah's son, Alfred, goes down a troubling path. We're also faced with a new mystery, of where the famous photo of Henrietta came from, and from where Michael Gold got Henrietta's medical records. Nobody seems to remember anything at all. Is this evidence of the conspiracy hinted at earlier in the book, or just the result of faulty memories?

This is also where the photo insert is in my copy of the book, so as a bonus question: were there any particular photos that caught anybody's interest?

Thanks for sticking with us, and sorry for the delay. With luck, normalcy should be restored soon. "

bookclub,"Bonjour all you bookclub people, this week's poem is In Muted Tone by Paul Verlaine


Ze texte: https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/55033/in-muted-tone


I prefer a brainstormy approach -- what are your thoughts, here
are my initial ones:

------

Content I, mood:  Soft -- restrained -- hushed -- muted.  

Content II, theme: Interpenetration

About spiritual intimacy and (I infer) sexual union:
  * Tree branches twine
  * love steeps -- like tea, as the water enters the tea, so does
  the tea enter the water
  * Blending souls
  * In last stanza: the lovers' despair is embodied in or articulated by the nightengales song

Content  III, theme: surrender: yielding, giving up ambition.  To give up
vain desire is to give up most desire.

Content IV: the speaker of the poem is imposing will over the ""you"".  It's
not a ""healthy caring relationship"" kind of thing, it's: here's what you
must do achieve some goal of the speaker's.

Content V: Stanza 3 stands out in sturcture mentioned below.  The
""you"" of the poem is asleep, with a pose (arms crossed on chest)
recalling charmed princesses, saints, the peacefully dead.

Content VI: what does gold grass suggest?  Sunset? Autumn?

Taxonomy: This is a ""capture and convey"" poem where the poet is attempting
to recreate an unusual or intense mood/perception into the reader -- it
is a sharing act.

Structure I: The first 4 stanzas are imperative, the last is -- gentle
prophecy?  Prevision?  Hope? 

Structure II: All but the third stanza are about ""us""/""we"".  The
third is solely about the beloved, ""you"".

Stucture III:  a,b,a,b rhyme.  The prominent internal rhyme in first
two lines, steep and deep, might take attention to other internal
rhymes. Possibles but I wouldn't notice them as rhyme:  1. ""eyes and"" ""futile end(eavor)
2. /nightengale / despair.  On the other  hand, from steep &amp; deep, there
are strong ""ee"" sounds  in all but the last stanza: evergreen, freed,
yield, breeze.  Obviously if there's any intent of  an aural chain there,
it's put in by Shapiro,  not Verlaine.

Structure IV: progression in time in the last two stanzas?

Title: In Muted Tone -- suggests a choice on the part of the poet?
The same matter could be done in strident tone?  

Wording I: ""let us yield then, you and I"" For an Enlish-language reader
it recalls the first line of ""Lovesong of J.  Alfred Prufock"" for
someone my age anyway -- one of the most famous lines in all 20th
C. poetry, different by one word, ""yied"" instead of ""go"". (Shapiro's
translation is from the 90s)

Wording II: The ""solemn"" last word gives makes the poem seem grave and
solemn.  At first read this struck me as self-important -- translated
rhyming poems always seem jarring to me at first -- but as I
accomodated my sensibilities to the poem, it seems a gathering up.
The lover's despair, with some dignity, embodied in song carries the
themes of interpenetration (human love with the natural world) and
cessation of strife, achievement of peace.

Wording III: ""Pines' vague lethargies"" is painting with a heavy brush,
creating the mood of hush/blurriness but one of  the lines that calls
attention to it being a translation.

bookclub,"/u/tstrand1204 nominated *Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell* for next month’s read, and I wanted to come campaign for it because I think it’s an excellent choice. I read this book back in 2004 and loved it. It’s a story about a pair of rival magicians (the wizard kind) and takes place during the Napoleonic Wars in England. It’s written as though it’s from the 19th century.

There’s a lot to discuss—we can do a bunch of comparison with novels of that time period, talk about how the author changed the economy of 19th-century England to accommodate magic, look at various themes of rivalry, gender, war, etc. I’ve got a bunch of ideas already and I’m super excited about the possibility of reading with you guys.

bookclub,"Hey, everyone. I'm sorry I'm late. It probably will happen again, but I'll try to keep it minimal. 

In Chapter 17 we see the progression from no consent, or very little consent from patients, to the research governing bodies requiring *detailed informed consent* for any studies. Now, I know at some point we discussed how doctors know more than patients and should be the decider on treatments. Does this chapter change anything? 

In Chapter 18, Skloot again emphasizes the scientific advancements made using HeLa. Do these advancements make the ethical concerns from the previous chapters less severe in your mind? What do you think about how the media portrayed the experiments the doctors were doing, specifically those using only cells and no human subjects? 

In Chapter 19 we are back to my favorite part, the story of the family. I knew the abuse Joe suffered was going to end badly, but as I read what a difficult time he had, and how no one really understood, it just broke my heart. I wonder what he might have been if he had received help sooner, or if he had never been beaten and hurt to begin with. 

Chapter 20 goes over the contamination of cells other than HeLa cells by HeLa cells. We see so many doctors simply disregard the research and continue using the potentially contaminated cells. It seems that in that time doctors truly did believe they could do whatever they wanted; that they were arrogant and believed in their own infallibility. 

Chapter 21 begins to dive into the family's anger over the HeLa cells. I believe we will return to this in later chapters, but if you have anything to add, feel free. 

Finally, in Chapter 22, we finally have Henrietta's name revealed. Do you think the staff went about this the wrong way? Should they have never released her name? Why or why not? 

Looking forward to hearing from you, and again, sorry about the delay. "

bookclub,"\*\*\*Trigger warning: suicide\*\*\*

Hi everyone! I'm excited to talk about Sylvia Plath's poem, ""[Lady Lazarus](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49000/lady-lazarus)"" with you all. When I taught 11th &amp; 12th grade English a couple years ago, I did a whole unit on Plath and this poem will always stand out as one of my favorites to discuss, so I couldn't pass up the opportunity to do so again (I teach 7th &amp; 8th grade now, so there's not much discourse in my life. Just...lots of badly drawn penises.)

[Here is a recording of Plath reading the poem in 1962](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkK2fwZfVjA).

It's amazing to hear her read it herself, however, I believe it reads more like open mic slam poetry ([Olivia Gatwood comes to mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yGzMUzrgzA)). It's charged with emotion in a way that is more like a performance piece than a read-in-your-head piece. This poem demands to be read aloud, even if it's just to an empty room. I encourage you to do so. Open the poem on your phone, stand up to an empty room, and read it aloud. I promise you'll get chills.

# Background

""Lady Lazarus"" was written in October 1962, and posthumously published in Plath's semi-autobiographical book *Ariel* in 1965. She died of a completed suicide on 11 February 1963. Knowing that she wrote this poem four months before her completed suicide makes it especially chilling to read and unpack. The first drafts of this poem were written in the later part of October, when she wrote 11 poems in one week. Ranging in moods from elevated optimism to her new life to raging anger with her estranged husband, these poems are a glimpse of a struggling, overwhelmed woman who just wants to break free of the shackles of her loneliness and despair.

# Topics/Thematic statements

**Dying** \-- Right from the title we have the allusion of Lazarus in the bible rising from the dead (or, ""Prufrock""'s lines ""Lazarus, come back from the dead,/come back to you all""). The connotation of the word *Lady* in the title also tells us right away that she is the womanly embodiment of Lazarus rising from the dead. The only problem is, she has to die first. So that leaves us with a sense of reincarnation or the revisited theme in the poem that she has more than one life to live (or is it that she has more than one chance to die?)

Overall, the thematic statement is that she yearns to live and die on her own terms, away from what has been expected of her in her life. More than anything, she demands to be taken seriously.

Let's talk about the specific ways she describes dying:

&gt;I have done it again  
&gt;  
&gt;One year in every ten I manage it-  
&gt;  
&gt;The first time it happened I was ten.  
&gt;  
&gt;It was an accident

When Plath was 10, she almost drowned in a swimming accident. This would be her first brush with death.

Then:

&gt;the second time I meant  
&gt;  
&gt;To last it out and not come back at all.

In 1953 she overdosed on her mother's sleeping pills and was found three days later in a crawl space by her brother and mother. This would be the first time she was hospitalized and the therapy started. Now, there were a couple times after, like the time she slashed her legs to see what would happen.

&gt;This is Number Three.  
&gt;  
&gt;What a trash  
&gt;  
&gt;To annihilate each decade.

What a way to foreshadow what would come only four months later when she completed suicide in February. Do you think she knew it would be the last time she attempted her death?

And then, of course, what I believe to be the best lines in the poem:

&gt;Beware  
&gt;  
&gt;Beware.  
&gt;  
&gt;Out of the ash  
&gt;  
&gt;I rise with my red hair  
&gt;  
&gt;And I eat men like air.

Anticipate this phoenix rising again, better than ever before. I believe Plath wanted a do-over, a chance to go back and restart. Perhaps the idea of the electroshock therapy she underwent so many times ""resetting"" the mind can be applied here. She wanted to be reset, to feel ""typical"" and perhaps live a life free of the demons that haunted her, free of a husband who wasn't faithful and left her in her time of greatest need. Maybe if she lived in a different time when mental illness wasn't so stigmatized she could be happier, healthier, and without the shackles of the men, like her father and husband, placed on her. Maybe if the therapy actually worked she would be finally free to live without the weight of the world on her shoulders.

**The Holocaust** \-- Controversially, Plath makes many allusions to The Holocaust. At the time ""Lady Lazarus"" was written, Plath had been living in England for three years, in a relatively close time period to the atrocities of The Holocaust. In a letter to her mother, Plath sort of justifies these allusions, saying that ""no one has the right to say \[that her\] psychological hell is any different than those condemned to the concentration camps.""

The first mention is in line 5 when she describes

&gt;...my skin  
&gt;  
&gt;Bright as a Nazi lampshade,  
&gt;  
&gt;My right food  
&gt;  
&gt;A paperweight,  
&gt;  
&gt;My face a featureless, fine  
&gt;  
&gt;Jew linen

Now, of course, [we know that Nazi lampshades are a real thing](https://www.npr.org/2010/12/28/132416206/New-Book-Tells-Story-Of-The-Lampshade). She's setting us up to ask us if we are terrified of her. People in her life have left, probably unsure of how to treat her; she's been hospitalized and given electroshock and insulin shock treatment. It's no wonder she demands to know if we are horrified by the spectacle of her, just like we would be with a lampshade made of human skin.

In line 65 she says,

&gt;So, so Herr Doktor.  
&gt;  
&gt;So, Herr Enemy

that we come to the realization that MAN, the doctor who comes to ""save"" her is the enemy. The juxtaposition of a person who ""does no harm"" is blinding; he *is* harming her, getting in the way of what she believes is and should be her destiny, *her* opus. She yearns to take back control of her life *and* her death, and to do both on her own terms. In line 11, Plath calls us, the readers, ""my enemy"" and here we are being referenced again, as the spectators of what she calls ""The big strip tease"" in line 29.

Then, at the end of the poem, she brings up ash - at this point there is no question of what the allusion is here. We are brought back to the crematoria and what is left of her?

&gt;A cake of soap,  
&gt;  
&gt;A wedding ring,  
&gt;  
&gt;A gold filling.

But then, a warning:

&gt;Herr God, Herr Lucifer  
&gt;  
&gt;Beware  
&gt;  
&gt;Beware.  
&gt;  
&gt;Out of the ash  
&gt;  
&gt;I rise with my red hair  
&gt;  
&gt;And I eat men like air.

These lines are almost a spell-like curse from our wronged, misunderstood, gawked-at heroine. It's a promise that she will not be tied to this earth by any man or god.

**Being a spectacle/martyrdom** \-- this is probably my favorite aspect of this poem. She is talking to us and ironically employing the very thing she condemns - she is playing into the spectacle of being a martyr. Why would she do this? For validation? Vindication? To make the reader feel guilt? To make the reader self-aware?

On the forefront of the feminist movement, Plath's words do not garner sympathy, instead, she impores that one should live and die on one's own terms. The turning point of the poem is in lines 43-45:

&gt;Dying  
&gt;  
&gt;Is an art, like everything else.  
&gt;  
&gt;I do it exceptionally well.

WHOA. If that doesn't give you chills, I don't know what will. These lines, especially placed where they are, turn the poem from autobiographical to an anthem. Do not pity this heroine. She is in control of her own fate and she's good at what she does. It goes back to the Lazarus allusion - she is a martyr for her cause.

Then there are the lines that address us as ""the peanut-crunching crowd"". In lines 25-34, we are the circus crowd, shoving each other to get a better view of her life; the idea that the human race has a morbid fascination with death or dying and we are part of the crowd shoving and jostling our way to get a closer look.

I especially love lines 50-64.

&gt;It’s the theatrical  
&gt;  
&gt;Comeback in broad day  
&gt;  
&gt;To the same place, the same face, the same brute     
&gt;  
&gt;Amused shout:  
&gt;  
&gt;‘A miracle!’  
&gt;  
&gt;That knocks me out. 

There's a juxtaposition of the elation of someone saving another from suicide, and then that person's disappointment at being saved. We're forced to ask ourselves: what about the experience from her perspective? If she is the captain of her own fate, to say, then how can she truly be a martyr to her cause if she isn't able to go through with carrying out that fate? It's a morbid thought, but aren't we just the spectators? And then, yes of course we are because:

&gt;There is a charge  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;For the eyeing of my scars,   
&gt;  
&gt;there is a charge     
&gt;  
&gt;For the hearing of my heart--  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;It really goes.  
&gt;  
&gt;And there is a charge, a very large charge     
&gt;  
&gt;For a word or a touch     
&gt;  
&gt;Or a bit of blood  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.   

What is the cost of this spectacle? Is she truly the martyr Lazarus was? Is this connection accurate?

# Final thoughts

There are a lot of controversial topics in this poem. I started off with a trigger warning because, even if you read the poem, this discussion will probably go into great details about the apparent merits of committing suicide, according to Plath. It's a really tough topic to discuss if you have suicidal ideations but I think there is a great opportunity to discuss and debunk the stigma of mental illness. If you are one of the lucky ones free from mental illness, it might be challenging to read the poem through Plath's eyes (does that make sense? It does in my head.) More than anything, I wanted to really look at her side of the story and try to understand a little bit of what she went through.

I could say so much more on this work, but I want to hear your thoughts. What do you agree or disagree with? What was different about the way you interpreted and unpacked the poem? What did I miss? How does this poem read and interpret differently at different stages of one's life? I'm about to turn 30 myself, putting myself in Plath's shoes today was a different experience than when I did four or so years ago when I was teaching this to 17 year olds."
bookclub,"Ok, up front I just want to point out we're only discussing through the end of Book 1 here. If you've read further and want to reference it, please use a spoiler tag (can be found in the sidebar).

Ho. Ly. Shit. I told you it'd get interesting. Didn't I say it would get interesting? I didn't realize that the dinner, revelation of the traitor, assassination, clandestine invasion/coup, destruction of House Atreides, exile of Paul and Jessica, Paul's awakening as a mentat, Paul's awakening of the sleeper, the Harkonnen revelation, Paul passing up a career as a Guild navigator, and OH YEAH Paul can *see the future now.*

Unfortunately, lumping the dinner in with the rest of these events kind of diminishes its importance. It's a great exploration of Paul's abilities and his relationship with his mother, and it begins to peel back the curtain of the plots and agents and schemes that would lead to the Atreides downfall. But then we get...the Atreides downfall. So what did everyone think of Kynes during that dinner? He's still something of an enigma, and it's not clear whose side he's on. Well, he's clearly on the Fremen side, but has the emperor's protection, but is friendly to the Atreides...so what do you think happened to him?

The more I think about Yueh's actions, the more I see how that was the only way things could have gone. Many of you were unclear about what Suk conditioning was, and I think I said it was like brainwashing. So yes, there is something that can overcome Suk conditioning--love.

Meanwhile, Paul and his mother escape by working together, although maybe they didn't need to because Idaho was hot on their heels. The Voice, for those of you who are still unclear on it, is not exactly space magic (but it certainly seems like it), but the formation, pitch, and tone of an imperative based on an incredibly intimate understanding of a person such that it will be obeyed reflexively unless the target is prepared for it and has great self-control. 

The scenes with the Baron illustrate a few things about him very well: his need for control, his ambition, his appetite for pleasures, and the fact that the Emperor views him as little more than a tool. The baron is also explicitly gay and, what I believe was ""generally accepted"" at the time, also a pedophile (by which I mean I think when the book was written the two were often equated even though they have no real correlation in actuality). He might be bisexual, as is hinted later in the chapter, but if he is, he certainly has a preference. I'm curious what your opinions are on this move: painting your villain character with particular stereotypical character traits as some sort of literary device. Gender and sexuality are concepts Herbert touches on in a few points in the Dune saga, and it's one of the areas that I'm conflicted about. Personally, I believe making the main antagonist gay *and* a pedophile implies that being gay is bad, which is not cool. But I'm interested in your take--is it just a character trait and I shouldn't read this much into it? Does it somehow normalize homosexuality (it does not but if you can convince me that it does, I'll eat my steel-toed shoes)?

Since I mentioned gender, I want to dip a toe into this one. We touched on it before with the Bene Gesserit ""witches,"" attempting to create the Kwisatz Haderach, a male Bene Gesserit (the feminine organization in the universe uses a breeding program with the ultimate goal of creating a male who will be the pinnacle of their achievement and exceed them in every way). I'm not sure what it says about Herbert or his views on women, but I find it a bit patronizing and demeaning. Perhaps I am misreading it but it's an issue which has been bothering me since the last time I read it.

Anyway, let's get to Paul in the last few pages. Something changes when he finds out his father has died. The loss of his childlike innocence seems to be what sparks his mentat-like abilities (I say -like because he has no formal training, but as far as I can tell he basically has become a mentat at this point), which on its own might be enough to help him and his mother survive. But less than a day later, his exposure to the spice is enough to unlock his psionic abilities (also, perhaps, sparked by trauma). To some extent, the BG have these psionic abilities--Jessica is aware of her pregnancy, among other details which will come out later in the book. But Paul, thanks, I think, to applying this psionic awareness to his mentat-computation skills begins to actually see the future. It is described as sensing ""the future as though it twisted across some surface as undulant and impermanent as that of the windblown kerchief."" I believe that his mentat abilities unlock the broad strokes of the future--general paths based on the probable outcomes to numerous decisions. Mentats, however, are limited by the data they have. But Bene Gesserit don't need massive amounts of data, they collect information with hyperawareness--a level of granularity that enhance Paul's abilities and give unbelievable detail to his foresight. If, like me, you aren't 100% on board with space drugs giving people magical powers, I think that's your explanation--two incredible skillsets combine, when mental acuity is enhanced by the spice, to create incredibly detailed predictions of potential futures. 

So what is everyone thinking of the book so far? Has it picked up enough? What's still confusing? Where is Kynes? Will Paul and his mother make it? What about Duncan? What does the Baron do now? Shucks, what about the Emperor?"
bookclub,"Hey guys! Still on mobile, bear with me as I'm traveling.

# First, remember to be respectful! Controversy is inevitable, but remember what matters is how you handle it. *Trolls will be banned*

So in this section we start with this credit story of Henrietta's viewing and funeral, and transition into very scientific information about how HeLa helped progress science. We heard Henrietta's cells were used to develop or learn about:

* Freezing techniques (preservation)
* Standardization
* Replication
* Clones
* Stem cells
* In vitro
* Chromosomes

And more. We also learn Tuskegee is selling HeLa for $10, and eventually Reader and Vincent are selling HeLa for up to $50, and making a huge profit. 

Next, we compare this story of success to the Lacks family. Henrietta's children being hungry and abused, shuffled from house to house, and generally mistreated. We fast forward and we get to visit the home-house and see where Henrietta is probably buried. The family could not afford headstones or even markers. Running out of room, they are staying bodies. 

Finally, we learn white and black Lackses don't mix. It is completely unheard of. I think this is significant, but I want your opinions first. 

So that's a recap. I want to know your reactions. What made your say ""Discrimination"" and what made you say ""Reasonable""? What did you learn? 

I want you to consider Dr. Gey's and John Hopkins' refusal to release Henrietta's name. What was your reaction there?"
bookclub,"[I woke up to this in my news feed today](https://www.marketplace.org/2018/07/09/business/who-owns-henrietta-lacks-disembodied-cells) and I felt compelled to share it as soon as possible.

We're not really to the point in the book where we're talking about the legal issues, but the basic legal reality is that nobody owns the cells at all. Anyone who possesses them can dispose of them as they wish (thus they can be used for research, sold, or thrown away) but there's no legal right to the cells. This is true of all 'discarded tissue', legally defined as any tissue that is no longer a constituent part of a person's body.

But a new lawyer working with Ron Lacks, Henrietta's grandson, has a bold new approach that could have some really wild implications - she wants to assert that the cells are alive, human and own *themselves*. The goal for the Lacks family in this is that they intend to be awarded guardianship of the new legal entity. 

The article contains the full interview with the lawyer, Christina Bostick.

What do you guys think?

bookclub,"Hi all, apologies for not posting last week's discussion post (and accidentally inverting the schedule--my bad). I've had some stuff going on and haven't had time to catch up and post. As a result, I'm pushing back the schedule through August 10, and deleting the theme day. New schedule follows:

13 July: From ""There is no escape, we pay for the violence of our ancestors."" to the end of Book 1. 

20 July: From the start of Book 2 to ""We came from Caladan--a paradise world for our form of life."" 

27 July: From ""Family life of the Royal Creche is difficult for many people to understand, but I shall try to give you a capsule view of it."" to ""My father, the Padishah Emperor, was 72 yet looked no more than 35 the year...""

3 August: From ""God created Arrakis to train the faithful"" to the end of Book 2.

10 August: From the start of Book 3 to ""When law and duty are one, united by religion, you never become fully conscious, fully aware of yourself.""

Time permitting, I may also post a theme discussion separately on the 10th.

Again, I'm sorry for having to change the schedule. My hope is that that's a better choice than consistently posting late."
bookclub,"Okay, let's try this again. I'm sorry for any formatting errors, I'm doing this on mobile. :-/

Chapter 7 largely covers the start of cell research and how that led to Gey's ability to keep Henrietta's cells alive. What stuck out to you? Did you learn anything? Did anything in particular upset or frustrate you?

&gt; Tissue culture was the stuff off racism, creepy science fiction, Nazis, and snake oil. It wasn't something to be celebrated. In fact, no one paid much attention to it at all. 

That quote bugged me a lot. Why weren't these other items more important as well? Are we missing important discoveries and terrible tragedies right now by just not paying attention?

In chapter 8, I am most struck by Lauren Aurelian's description of Gey's visit to Henrietta, even though it is the only account of it. Does this change your perception of Get or Henrietta at all? What about of the situation?

In chapters 9 and 10, we get to see into the lives of those who were once important to Henrietta, and how this journey with the cells had affected them. I am amazed they even considered the interviews again. What do you think? I love the way Skloot describes Cootie. 

Finally, in chapter 11 we see Henrietta's cousin bind together to donate blood so she can continue to get care. We see the doctors accept there is nothing they can do. And we hear her last words:

&gt; You make sure Day takes care of them children... Especially my baby girl Deborah. Don't you let anything bad happen to them children when I'm gone.

Even as she is watching her life slip away, she is concerned for the welfare of others. Throughout the book this far, I think this is a point Skloot has driven home. In life and in death, Henrietta always gave of herself; was always concerned with others. 

What do you think?

bookclub,"##Intro

Hello again! This week’s poem is [Bluebird by Charles Bukowski](https://allpoetry.com/poem/8509539-Bluebird-by-Charles-Bukowski), a short and easy read that has lots to unpack! It was published in 1992 in his book “The Last Night of the Earth Poems.” 

##Themes

The first thing that struck me was the visual contrast of a tiny, delicate bluebird living inside the heart of such a tough person. For reference, here is a [bluebird]( http://hughvandervoort.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Bluebird-112.jpg) and here is [Charles Bukowski](http://www.latimes.com/resizer/16Rt5zkD6vLX3GvXNbODxSehWD0=/1400x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EPLLSKLIEZG4TAJDYQEZYZ6ZUI.jpg), the poem’s author. 

When I think of a bluebird, I think of hope and purity, innocence and childlike wonder. But this is quickly drowned out by whiskey and cigarette smoke, secrecy, and shame. The tone of the poem bounces from guilty to melancholy to accusatory. All of the things surrounding the narrator speak of a life spent indulging in vices – “the whores and the bartenders
and the grocery clerks” – and keeping the bluebird locked up so that people “never know that
he's in there.”

The poem is full of toughness

&gt; “do you want to mess me up?”

&gt; “stay in there, I'm not going to let anybody see you.” 

&gt; “I only let him out at night sometimes”

without ever crossing over into tragedy (“I haven't quite let him die”). There are little moments of tenderness

&gt; and we sleep together like
that
with our
secret pact
/ and it's nice enough to
make a man
weep

but our narrator never fully gives in to the bluebird. He lets him out at night, when no one is around to hear the singing, but always puts him back. He calls this ‘clever’, but to me it speaks more of sadness and loneliness than anything else. This bluebird is a part of him that he feels he needs to keep hidden from the world, something that makes him vulnerable, something he numbs with sex, cigarettes, and alcohol. 

##The bluebird

So what does the bluebird symbolize? It’s clearly not all pure and delicate, if it’s powerful enough to “screw up the works” and “blow my book sales in Europe.” It is a part of him that’s hard to repress, as he has to contend with it every day. 

Maybe I’ve been watching too much Queer Eye, but one of my first thoughts was that the bluebird represents a softer side to the author that he feels the need to repress in order to maintain a façade of what he believes masculinity to be. My interpretation was he was raised believing that vulnerability is something to be ashamed of, that displaying emotions (“I don’t weep”) is a weakness. Accepting the bluebird means ruining his image, his career, and his relationships.

I think there is also something symbolic about where the bird is caged, as though the bluebird might be the personification of his heart.

What do you think?

##Favourite lines

&gt; There's a bluebird in my heart that
wants to get out

&gt; but I'm too clever, I only let him out
at night sometimes

&gt; when everybody's asleep.

&gt; I say, I know that you're there,
so don't be
sad.

Feel free to post yours!


##Closing thoughts

The poem ends with a question – *do you?* – which I would like to leave as a closing thought. Do you have a bluebird? If so, do you know what it is? What keeps it inside? You don’t have to answer here, but think about it for a minute.

As always, feel free to comment about your thoughts on the poem – what did you notice, what did you like or dislike, what stood out, how did it make you feel?

bookclub,"Hello! 

We have seen an uptick in the number of requests for nonfiction selections. As a result, we are creating a special category for nonfiction, like we have for modern, Gutenberg, etc... 

Here is how it works. We are going to limit the number of reads going on in a month. This will be 2 books that have been voted on and the weekly poems. In addition to the 2, a community member is welcome to start an Evergreen, but the mods will not be taking responsibility for community-run Evergreens. We do request only one Evergreen per month. 

When we start the vote (this usually begins on or around the 16th of the month) the mods will announce the types of books we are voting on. The options include: 

* Modern: This is any book not currently in the public domain.

bookclub,"Hello! 

Let's do this! 

In chapter 1 I was particularly struck by the doctor's notes on Henrietta. As you read over them, how do you see the patient? Do you think the staff is being fair to Henrietta? Does it surprise you that only 4 months after giving birth to her son, she discovers she has cancer? Why do you think it wasn't caught earlier? 

In chapter 2 I am surprised by Henrietta's relationship with Day (David). 

 * What do you think about the age gap? Henrietta was 13 when she got pregnant with her first child, and Day was nearly 5 years older than her. I'm surprised there were so few people upset. Only ""Crazy Joe"" and Gladys attempted to stop the wedding. What are your thoughts on this? 

 * We get a peek into what is expected of black workers as Henrietta is starting her life. Even as Henrietta and her family travelled to ""The Promised Land"" of Turner Station, we see there will be difficult work for little pay in racist conditions. How do you think this impacts Henrietta's medical decisions (or life decisions for that matter). As we continue to read, remember these conditions and consider how they affect the Lacks family as time goes on. 

In chapter 3, we find Henrietta dealing with the news of her cancer, by not telling anyone. We also get an idea of how cervical cancer was researched and regarded. I loved the way Skloot slipped in the education without detracting from the story. What do you think of the cells being collected without consulting Henrietta? 

In chapter 4 we get to see Gey, and learn a bit about his process and his history. I found this bit fascinating. He was determined and optimistic and I love it. Except Henrietta is still recovering while Gey discovers her cells are ""immortal"". Does that change how you see Gey at all? 

In chapter 5 we get a beautiful idea of who Henrietta is. She is a firecracker of a person, bringing joy to all who knew her. Do you think this is romanticized at all from those who knew and loved her? Then we find out that the doctors did not fully inform Henrietta of the consequences of treating her cancer. They say bluntly, she would not have had the treatment if she had known she would not be able to have more children. I find myself wondering if she would have changed her mind knowing she would die without the treatment. Given... she dies with it... (Okay, that makes me sad). 

In chapter 6, we get to see Rebecca attempt to connect with the Lacks family. They are hesitant and cautious to say the least. Deborah's changing reaction surprised me. Do you think their reaction is justified? Keep this in mind as we read further. 

Okay, that's what I've got. What about you? "

bookclub,"Hello, and welcome to the introduction to *The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks** by Rebecca Skloot. 

Today I just wanted to talk about the ""Prologue"" and ""Deborah's Voice"", as well as the ""A Few Words About This Book"" section. These are the first three sections of the book, and while they aren't technically a part of the book proper, I do believe that reading, or at least having a general knowledge of what was said, is going to enhance our experience with this book. 

In the ""A Few Words About This Book"" my main takeaways were: 

* What we may consider typos and incorrect grammar and out of date or even offensive language are the way the people interviewed spoke. Some people may be irritated by this, but I've found it gets easier as the book goes on. 

* *HeLa* is pronounced *hee-lah*. 

* Scientific dates are the dates when the research was conducted. 

In the ""Prologue"", we get a peek into the mind of the author and what started her on the path to this book. The catalyst for this book can be seen as so minuscule. I'd like to know how you see it. 

Finally, ""Deborah's Voice"" is a short letter from Henrietta's youngest daughter. 

This book will be controversial. As we begin, I'd like to remind everyone to be civil. We will not tolerate prejudice, trolling, or generally disrespectful behavior. Remember we are a book club of diverse people. Where possible, be kind. "

bookclub,"Hey!

So this week we'll read another poem by Yeats, and one not terribly upbeat, so prepare yourself!

And also I'm not sure if I got too much to say about it, so I'm sorry if this is too short.

[How to read a poem by /u/surf_wax](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/7h6o9s/poem_of_the_week_the_love_song_of_j_alfred/) 

## [Here's the poem](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57294/the-sad-shepherd)

And the main points:

1. Initial, no-pressure read-through
2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem
3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.
4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?
5. What do you think the poem is about?
6. Favorite verses

---

### 1. Initial, no-pressure read-through

### 2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem

This is, as the title implies, a bit of a downer.

What caught my eye was how sad the poem ended. I thought it would end with someone actually listening to his sad cry, but it's just sad all the way through.

### 3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.

### 4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?

Well, the poem is quite straightforward, at least in its mos literal sense. It's a short story about a shepherd that is lonely and miserable and tries to get anyone to hear his story, but nobody does. Although maybe we do in part?

### 5. What do you think the poem is about?

I'm not actually sure, and I feel like I'm missing part of the historical context, because there has to be something else apart from just the poem itself, right? It feels like there has to be a more metaphorical meaning to the poem than just loneliness and sadness. However, I'm just not sure what it is.

### 6. Favorite verses

&gt;Cried out, Dim sea, hear my most piteous story!  
&gt;The sea swept on and cried her old cry still,  
&gt;Rolling along in dreams from hill to hill.   

and: 

&gt;Till my own words, re-echoing, shall send  
&gt;Their sadness through a hollow, pearly heart; 

That's about it!

bookclub,"I am trying so hard to keep up, you guys, but I haven't even cracked the book open yet, and I'm going off of decade-old memories. Worms! Kwisatch Caddyshack! Lady Arakkis! The spice must flow! Discuss!

Nah just kidding, things aren't that dire. /u/Duke_Paul is off taking care of some ""real life"" this weekend, but he(?) left me with the meat and potatoes for a talk about **duplicity** and **lies** and people being **sneaky af** (and he is probably going to regret it as soon as he sees this post). But it's our time, ladies, gentlemen and enbies, so here we go.

/u/Duke_Paul gives us a lot of examples of how a lot of things are not as they seem in his previous post:

* Jessica hides the note from Lady Fenrig
* Paul pretends to be sleeping
* The weirding room/greenhouse glass tinting the sun yellow
* Leto hiding his feelings and fatigue from everyone, hiding his faith in his wife
* Yueh's lies and how they are devastating him
* Kynes's evasion about the worms

So, to kick off discussion:

1. Do you think duplicity is a theme of the book? Do you think it's an intentional theme?
1. Given how the lies are treated, what do you think Herbert is saying about lies? Are they acceptable in certain circumstances? How do different characters use lies, and do the things the lies are hiding have anything in common?
1. Have you noticed any other instances?

Second last, are there any common threads *you're* following? Are you noticing usage of a particular color, maybe? Any kind of imagery that repeats itself, topics you've seen pop up in any sort of pattern?

And actual last, how are you feeling about the book so far? Anything you want to talk about? Questions that other readers might be able to answer for you?

Happy reading, and happy weekend."
bookclub,"A few days have passed since the scheduled end of the novel, and the end of the month approaches, and it's time for us to reflect, and share our final thoughts. This last thread is something of a free space to share whatever last things you may want to express for the book. Some possibilities include your feelings for the book, personal reviews, or interesting pieces of criticism.

First, I'd like to recognize that it is likely that few have made it here. Anyone who was looking for a light and easy beach read was very probably disappointed. Though the book was very brief in terms of absolute length, it very much ended up filling the month for me, occupying a great deal of my free thoughts. 

For all of that, I'm hesitant to render any kind of verdict on the novel in terms of 'good' or 'bad' or even 'liked' or 'disliked.' *To The Lighthouse* showed me something entirely unique in terms of writing: although I hear it constantly bandied about, one of those inane truisms that get repeated among both aspiring and working writers until the words are meaningless and any valuable wisdom contained within has shrivelled and collapsed into dust, that a writer should write for themselves -- but *To The Lighthouse* is what that truly looks like. 

Any judgement I might render for or against it is meaningless, because throughout the book I *knew* that it did not fucking care if I, or anybody, ever read it. *To The Lighthouse* is intense psychological catharsis crystallized into a form that vaguely resembles a novel, though it eschews every value of story-telling or characterization I've ever been taught as a writer or experienced through reading. 

It is a privilege, of sorts, to be invited so deeply into Woolf's mind, where the shadows of her past live out echoes of incidents in her memory in one part and bits of what didn't happen but might have done in another. Not all privileges are pleasurable, though, and reading *To The Lighthouse* has its moments of deep discomfort. 
If I appreciated one thing about the book more than any other it was the portrait of Lily as the anxiety-prone artist, and what seemed to be Woolf's very real thoughts about the making of art that Lily serves to dispense. There is very little more difficult, and less appreciated, than the difficulty of taking the fleeting visions in one's own head and committing them to paper or canvas or film, and there is a common insecurity among those of us who engage in these crafts that I feel Woolf captures in *To The Lighthouse* better than any other work I've read, perhaps because it is her direct thoughts on the matter barely filtered by even the thin veneer of fiction. 

More than anything, I can say that whether I enjoyed the experience or not, I feel I am actually changed by having read *To The Lighthouse* and that's far more than most books I have definitely enjoyed can say.


I'd like to end with the inclusion of some words by someone generally agreed to be more clever than I am.

bookclub,"*I have had my vision.*

With these words, Lily Briscoe completes her painting, and Virginia Woolf the novel, and these actions may well be one and the same, their vision the same as one another's. 

The final section of *To The Lighthouse* seemed to me a much harder march than the preceding portions. Abstractions, recollections, and tangents slowed that final journey to the Lighthouse at times to a crawl. But then, the destination was never the point of the novel, if indeed the novel has any point at all.

Structurally, ""The Lighthouse"" is divided into two parallel paths with one being anchored by Lily, and the other by the children Cam and James. These paths each meander and at times it doesn't seem to matter which path we're on, or who's doing the recollecting, but there does seem to be an aim to each of them. 

Physically, Cam and James are sailing to the Lighthouse that had been the destination promised from the first pages of the book, while Lily struggles to complete her painting. Meanwhile, the children are coming to terms with their feelings about their father, and Lily is coming to terms with herself.

With Lily, what we get is a hidden essay on the nature and frustrations of the artist and the creation of art, with innumerable bits of wit and wisdom about how difficult it can be to capture the fickle sparks of inspiration on a physical form. In a sense, I feel the book was always in part about itself being written, with Lily's painting being a stand in for the novel. 

But at the same time Lily is dealing with her painting, she's also trying to justify herself to herself, and wrangling the ghost of Mrs Ramsay that dwells in her heart and is awakened by her being in that place. In stark contrast to the end of ""The Window"" where Mrs Ramsay had announced herself triumphant, we see through Lily's memories of the past years and her associations that everything Mrs Ramsay had wrought had failed, characterized primarily by the poor results of Paul and Minta's marriage and Lily's not having herself married William Bankes. 

All in all, we get the sense that a world without Mrs Ramsay is an ill-ordered one, and that it was she who held the universe together for those whose lives she interfered in. 

Mr Ramsay gets little time to himself in the section, but his voice does come through in a few places. Early on, his interaction with Lily showcases his desire for the sympathy of women which seems to define much of his character. Without his wife as a fountain for that sympathy he is lessened and his less sanguine nature is left to wreak havoc. He surfaces again in an interaction with Cam where he disdains her ""vagueness"" (which seems to carry in this context a meaning of 'not widely learned') but also admits that this same 'vagueness' is maybe what he loves most about women.

For the most part, though we see him through his children who as we begin the journey to the Lighthouse are attempting to sabotage the trip, having to be forced into it. Cam and James have reached an agreement that they shall ""resist tyranny to the death"". 
Cam's resolve flags quickly enough, and over the course of the trip the image of tyranny, which is mostly received from James, dissolves and she sees her father for the sad, lonely old man that he is and though she tries her hardest to keep faith with her brother's crusade, she is constantly on the verge of giving her father that sympathy which he expects from women. 

This is the first we hear from James's own mind. Earlier in the book we had heard James's desire for the Lighthouse from his mother, but now we receive his resentment for being made to go against his will all these eleven years later. He feels an intense desire at first to kill his father for his tyranny, though later he revises this opinion to wanting to kill his father's tyranny which he sees as an intruder upon his father's otherwise good nature that if he could stab through the heart he could have just this better version of his father. Ultimately, his resistance ends with the simple fact of his father praising him for his safe docking of the boat.

But all this sketch of the major components of the section feels entirely inadequate a description or analysis of the whole. There is so much packed into these 46 pages that doesn't fit neatly into the shape of narrative, and it's hard to pick apart all that's there without filling twice that length at least in notes and commentary.

In a few days I'll be posting the final discussion thread for summary, review and discussion of criticism of the book as a whole, but I'll be well shocked if I've come to any real conclusions as to my feelings about it by then. 

This is the end of the novel, but if you're just now joining us know that the previous discussion threads are still open for business. I, at least, will be happy to discuss any portion of this book for some time to come. 

For now, I look forward to any contribution anybody has to offer and will otherwise see you back here on Friday in a vain attempt to wrap things up."
bookclub,"Apologies, all, for the delay. I had some issues pop up this weekend and haven't had time to post.

I promised you it would get more interesting, and did I deliver, or did I deliver?! First there's an assassination attempt, then cryptic warnings, paranoia, plots within plots, subterfuge, dissembling, and worm attacks!

So, rushing through: Paul is nearly assassinated by a little assassin-bot, but survives thanks to some luck and his excellent training. Jessica finds a room so lavish in its water use as to insult the entire planet, and contained within a message from a trusted ally, warning of a traitor close at hand. The Duke is tired, overworked, and furious that ""they tried to take the life of [his] son."" We meet a Fremen, and Idaho forges an alliance.Suspicions run high, trust runs low, albeit briefly. Husband turns against wife, but not against his son. The Duke meets Liet, who meets Paul and starts to believe the legends. They all fly out to see what sand operations look like, and the Duke makes the humane call to save the men working on the rig even at the cost of losing the spice they were mining. Such a man could command fanatic loyalty, and Paul is learning from him.

So one thing I noticed, which I had noticed starting at the end of the last section, is that everyone is lying in some form or other. Yueh, at the end of the last section, was hiding something--his conflicted loyalty--from Jessica, and she knew it but brushed it aside. In this section, Duke Leto is constantly hiding his emotional response to the attempt on his son's life, his weariness, and his worries from his men, his lieutenants, and even his son. Jessica initially hides the hidden message from her son and Hawat, although eventually she opens up. Even the filterglass in the weirding room creates a false image, distorting the light of the sun. Paul, throughout all of this, is fairly open and direct--uncomplicated and naive, not realizing, it seems, the import of his words or his questions. Edit: Forgot to mention Paul's thought about the worms and the spice, cutting through Kynes's ""lies and half-truths.."" ""If there's a relationship between spice and worms, killing the worms would destroy the spice.""

One quote I particularly enjoyed was, ""Arrakis makes us moral and ethical."" It's surprising because the planet did not have that effect on the Harkonnens, but perhaps a good thing. The desert, and natural forces in general, as a stress and a purifying element on society is definitely an interesting concept here.

So let me know what you thought, if you think it's picking up, what words or concepts you didn't get, what theories and ideas you have, etc. Or even just how you're enjoying the book in general!"

bookclub,"Hello and welcome to our discussion on *Tulips* by Sylvia Plath! Here is [the poem](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49013/tulips-56d22ab68fdd0), which was written in 1961 and later published in the collection Ariel, two years after her death. 

##First impressions

I’ve loved this poem since I first read it in university. I love the narrative element, and the way the author uses colours to represent the struggle between the peacefulness of disappearance and the explosiveness of life and the tulips. I’ve tried to unpack some of the themes I noticed while reading the poem, but there are definitely more than what I’ve listed, and I’d love if you could share your thoughts on the poem and anything you’d like to add to the analysis!

##Themes

**Eyes and watching**

The idea of watching and being watched comes up a lot – the nurses watch her, the flowers watch her, even the sun is watching her, as if she has relinquished herself and her life is no longer about action or participation, but about passive observation.
	
&gt; “They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff   

&gt; Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.”

&gt; “Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.”   

&gt; “I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow   

&gt; Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,   

&gt; And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.”   

**Colours**

Specifically the white of the hospital room contrasted with the vivid red of the tulips, and of the author’s heart: “Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in,” white walls, white caps, white lids, and then “The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me,” a rust-red engine, a bowl of red, a dozen red lead sinkers. I really love this vivid imagery because it paints a picture of the room as well as providing a stark contrast between the peace of the hospital room and the liveliness of the tulips, which I think represents her struggle between letting go of life and fighting to live. What did you think of all the colour?

**Water**

The idea of being immersed in water, and the emptiness and openness it brings, is repeated throughout the poem. It’s like a visual metaphor for the freedom she craves in death, and it brings a sense of motion to the poem.

&gt; “My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water

&gt; Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.”

&gt; “I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books   

&gt; Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.”

&gt; “Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river   

&gt; Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.”  

&gt; “The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,

&gt; And comes from a country far away as health.”

**Fishhooks**

Another image that is repeated is that of fishing hooks and sinkers, which ties into the water imagery. In the context of the poem, these hooks seem to be preventing the author from fully disappearing. 

&gt; “My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;   

&gt; Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.”

&gt; “Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,   

&gt; A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.”

**Erasure**

Again, the main struggle that I see in the poem is between life and death. The author wants nothing more than to disappear, but everything in her life, and in her hospital room (especially the tulips) is fighting with her to stay. She refers to her past life as baggage, and when she watches it disappear it brings her a kind of inner peace. One line that was particularly strong: “And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.” She says:

&gt; “I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted // To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.

&gt; How free it is, you have no idea how free——The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,”

I came across [an analysis by Jeannine Dobbs](http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/m_r/plath/tulips.htm) that I really liked:

&gt; Her freedom is both wonderful and terrible because the price is so high. The woman must give up her man and her child that hook onto her, as well as her things, her possessions. And the ultimate price--and reward--is death.

##Form

I don’t know too much about poetry form, other than the fact that *Tulips* is written in free verse – it has no meter or rhyming scheme, but it is still put together in a very careful way. There are 9 verses of 7 lines each, and some lines seem to have their own rhyming schemes or a sense of musical flow (“the nurses pass and pass”, “as the light lies on these white walls”). What did you think about the form of the poem?

##Favourite lines

Even if you don’t have any thoughts you want to share about the meaning or meter of the poem, please feel free to post your favourite lines or even a couple words that stood out to you! Here is the line that catches me every time I come back to this poem:

&gt; I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted

&gt; To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.

##Final thoughts

*Tulips* was written following Sylvia Plath’s hospitalization for an appendectomy, so there is definitely a strong autobiographical element to the story being told. I think the poem is absolutely beautiful, and I am awed at her ability to use words to create such vivid imagery. The idea of losing yourself so completely is compelling, and juxtaposed with the persistent struggle for life (the noise and pressure of the tulips, the idea of healing after sickness, the enduring connections you have to your past and your identity).  

Let me know your thoughts on the poem – what stood out, how did it make you feel, how did it achieve that feeling? Which do you think she chooses in the end - life or freedom? What patterns did you notice? What does it all mean? 

Thank you for reading along with me!

Please, nominate several poems, including any that didn't get selected last time that you still want to see us do! One poem per comment so voting is easy, just like we do for novels. The only requirement is that the poem is freely available online (please provide a link), wasn’t written by you or your best friend, hasn't been done before, and isn’t super long — let’s use Christina Rosetti’s “Goblin Market” as a benchmark and keep it to ~575 lines or below for now.

Now, I'm not precisely *jealous* of the level of activity present in the other current reads, but I think this novel deserves a fair share of the attention. No matter what your level of contribution is, you're welcome here, and remember the previous threads and the marginalia thread are still open as well, so even if you're a little behind there's a place to discuss.

Now, this new section was a distinct departure from ""The Window"" in terms of style and content, finally breaking out of the walls of the psyches of the Ramsays and their guests.

Instead, and surprisingly, we get the story of the house and grounds in the Ramsays absence, with a few major events from their lives used as punctuation and markers of time's passage to give context to the state of the house.

Mrs. Ramsay dies. Prue gets married, gets pregnant and then also dies. Andrew dies in the war. Mr Carmichael publishes a successful book of poetry. 

In the meantime, the house is falling apart and memory of the Ramsays is growing fuzzy as the full-time residents of the area also die off or drift away, and are replaced and only one aging lady combats the forces of time and nature, and largely loses the battle and her will as it becomes less and less likely that anyone will come back to occupy the house again.

Then a call comes, and all available forces are put into play to force back the advances and try to reclaim the house. When that is won, and the real war is also over, it is Lily Briscoe who arrives, along with Mr Carmichael.

This week, in a further attempt to foster discussion, I'm going to pose a few more direct questions, alongside my usual sort of observations.

- In this section a lot happens, but little is narrated and far more fates are left unsaid than are detailed. Instead, all the focus is on the house and grounds. Characters are replaced with objects and weather patterns. How does the state of the house reflect the state of England in war-time, and what do the remnants of the Ramsays left behind say about them?

- In ""The Window"", Mr Carmichael is an oft mentioned, frequently present, but largely silent figure. Compared to the Ramsays, who have suffered much loss, Carmichael's fortunes seem to have risen. What might this suggest?

- Mrs Ramsay was the focus of the early part of the novel, and the center point for the interactions of characters. In ""Time Passes"" she is suddenly and unceremoniously ripped away. It is unlikely, though, that she will be any less important for her having passed. How might her absence be defining for the coming chapters?

- There is a moment when the beam of the lighthouse is the only thing that disturbs the rooms in their decaying state. Earlier, in ""The Window"" Mrs Ramsay sat watching the third pass of the lighthouse beam and imagined herself become one with it. Is Mrs Ramsay still watching the house?

- Only one character lends human thought to this section of the narrative. Mrs McNab could not be more different a person than the well-educated, well-heeled Ramsays and their companions. What does her character show about Woolf's visions of the lower classes, and how does her character, and her unappreciated war to preserve the house, reflect on the Ramsays?

- Finally, Lily returns to the house. What does it mean that she and Carmichael are the first noted to arrive in the post-war period, essentially moving the focus of the story from the Ramsays to her?

[Here is a copy](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rnanian/Keats-Indolence.html) that
has good non-spoiler gloss for about 10 words and allusions that are
likely unfamiliar.

The rhyme and rhythm in Keats usually seems graceful and unforced to
me, but in fact there are a lot of inversions / strange word orders /
antique phrasing to achieve it.  Some inverted wordings -- stepp'd
serene, ripe was the drowsy hour, unhaunted quite, pale of cheek,
fatiguéd eye, a lawn besprinkled o'er -- etc.  It seems to me that there's a
lot affinity between this and the well-known poems of Poe -- both that
antique/spooky/driven attributes.

And the first line is
""bigly"" weird, in passive voice avoids giving the Subject (that is,
you would usually express this as ""*I* saw three figures,"" and *I*
is avoided.)  When you omit *I* for the subject, it seems to me that's
self-important or royal -- if I say ""All these things have been done"",
meaning ""I  did that  stuff"" -- that  seems to  me royal or pompous,
dramatic wording.

An irreverent summary: he gets up and sees three ghosts trotting
around, he recognizes them as avatars of Ambition, Love and Poetry,
the old L.A.P. dance if you need a mnemonic, they fade when he
recognizes them, he thinks how they're not so great as up to be
they're crack'd, sounds like he starts to drift off and then they're
back and he gives them the boot, bids them scoot.

Around line 35 is the punch line: ""For Poesy! — no, — she has not a
joy, — At least for me, — so sweet as drowsy noons, And evenings
steep’d in honey’d indolence"".  If you read this biographically, it
seems insincere: Keats was ambitious and plagued by romantic love.
His saying he is tortured by love sounds like any self-dramatizing
artist saying ""you think this is easy, you have  no idea how I suffer"".

BUT -- for me the overall effect is a powerful invocation and
celebration of the sumptuous joy of ease and comfort -- physical,
intellectual and emotional. In the comments for the next few days,
I'll sprinkle little observations about form, there is more than
enough craft to call out in this one.  

This  is one of  five odes -- if you get classic poetry at all in school,
I think Ode on a Grecian Urn is one of the most likely you'll ever get.
Ode to Autumn, Ode to a Nightingale, and Ode to Psyche are the others,
that last one was a bit of life-changer for me.

bookclub,"Welcome to Dune!

Some of you chimed in to the progress check I posted earlier in the week, which is great. Hopefully everyone made it this far without getting bored or too confused. But to that end, first, a promise: Things will pick up soon. Fairly soon. I promise. Second, questions. What questions do you have so far, or what words or phrases don't you understand? Hopefully I or others will be able to offer clarity.

Right up front, I want to apologize--we don't have the bandwidth and I don't have the time to dig into every little thing that happens in these posts. If you want to talk about something I don't mention, bring it up in the comments!

Characters we met:  
Paul Atreides, Human  
Jessica, Bene Gesserit  
Duke Leto Atreides, Duke of House Atreides  
Gurney Halleck, Weapons Master  
Thufir Hawat, Mentat and spymaster  
Doctor Yueh, Doctor  
Reverend Mother Mohaim, Bene Gesserit  
Shadout Mepes, Fremen  
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, Baron of House Harkonnen  
Feyd-Rautha, Baron's nephew  
Piter De Vries, mentat and sadist  
Let me know if I forgot anyone, please.

So what all happened in this portion? We met the Atreides family--the House, really, the Harkonnens. Paul was tested for his humanity, and the Atriedes relocated to Arrakis. We also saw into the plotting and machinations of several different groups.

First thing, we learned Paul is special. He has been trained in a way few has, to sense truth and detect minutae--his mind is truly superlative, in preparation, apparently, for the test he faces in the first few pages. But also for the test he faces throughout the book--his existence in this world, and on Arrakis.

There is a lot going on in this scene. Paul is being tested--this is a major theme for Herbert, testing or balancing--specifically, his humanity is being tested. This turns out to be another major theme--humanity, and who really qualifies as a human, and the question of survival being a question of humanity or subhumanity. The whole scenario tests him and his abilities. I'm curious about what aspects you saw being tested, and how you think you would perform in such an environment.

We also get to see the Harkonnen's scheme--plans within plans and feints within feints. Giving up Arrakis is only a temporary measure, until they can return, with the Emperor's own troops, to retake it from the failing Duke. But this is all part of a plan to kill the Duke, which is the Baron's real goal. And even within this plan he has at least one feint we've already seen--Yueh is not the only threat. (Also notable here: Herbert implies that the main villain is, apparently, gay and possibly a pedophile. I am assuming the two were perceived as related at the time, but can't say for sure. It is an interesting commentary, though--Herbert does bring up orientation and gender roles throughout these books.)

And then we turn around and find out that the Atreides already know the planet is a trap by the Harkonnens--they do not know about a traitor or any other threats, but they are wary and expectant. And apparently they have _two_ mentats.

When the Atreides arrive on Arrakis, there is an apparently terse exchange between Jessica and the Duke, which I feel doesn't really portray their relationship, as Leto seems official and standoffish. We learn about the Duke and the hardness of the Atreides line--lest you think they are sterling heroes. Good men, perhaps, great men even, but not pure heroes. There is a darkness to the family. And _then_ we meet the Shadout, something like a chief butler or majordomo (traditionally a male role), and have this exceptionally strange encounter. This time it is Jessica being tested, for what we do not know, although she quickly identifies it as whether or not she fits the legends the Bene Gesserit (BG) planted on the planet in the past. She essentially gets very lucky in bluffing her way through it. This seems like chance, but she was relying on the languages she learned from the BG, which led her to say the right thing, inadvertently. So was it luck, or would it always have been the case that she would have called the crysknife a ""maker of death?"" Following a Harkonnen occupation, wishing to win over the locals, naturally Jessica would reach to her training in an attempt to connect with them. And naturally the word for knife contained the correct keyword for Mapes. So again I ask, was it chance, or some other force at work?"

bookclub,"So we come to the end of the first part of *To The Lighthouse*, and the primary question I have to ask of all of you is this: **What do you think of the The Window as a complete object?** 

I'll leave that question to linger as I muse over some of the specifics of the latter half of the section.

If Chapter 10 was a solid stopping spot, Chapter 11 was not nearly so kind a place to pick back up. It was the most abstract chapter to date, and began a trend of Mrs Ramsay's narrative becoming somewhat more disjointed and fanciful, more prone to departures from reality than the other characters'. Right from the start though, we see a moment where Mrs Ramsay admits something surprising when she pits the idea that ""Children never forget"" against saying ""We're in the Lord's hands now."" As she reasons out this conflict, with 'children never forget' representing a placement of parental responsibility, and the 'Lord's hands' being an abdication of that responsibility, she roughly states that she doesn't have much faith or belief in a god, and reproves herself for the stray thought that ""we are in the Lord's hands."" This admission of, though she never says it, ""atheism"" seems a major revelation for her character when placed up against the accusation (now foisted off onto the children as much as possible) of atheism against Tansley (and Mr Ramsay by proxy.)

There's a moment here, also, where we see a tension on Mr Ramsay's part with James, where he almost sees James as a threat, or rival, for Mrs Ramsay's attention.

Thereafter we get to see a good deal of ""interaction"" between Mr and Mrs Ramsay, where each of them are to speaking to the other but their conversations don't seem to match up, and they continuously speak past one another, and where we see Mrs Ramsay, especially, drifting off into internal tangents and are there treated to Mrs Ramsay's very complicated feelings towards her husband. While Mr R, internally desires for solitude and to be away from his children and the many guests, Mrs R almost catches it but interprets it as a resentment towards her, but like all of Mr R's faults she attributes this as a symptom of the 'greatness' she sees in him, and seems to believe that everything that upsets her about him is forgivable for this reason, but at the same time when he does the correct thing, she suspects him of only doing it to please her, and therefore never gives him any credit for the trying. Mr R is stuck in a position with his wife where he can neither do any right or any wrong, and it seems to me a very poor place for a marriage to sit.

In Chapter 13, we're finally given the answer to the lingering question of whether ""Nancy went with them"" and finally properly introduced to the characters of Nancy, Andrew, Paul and Minta. The quartet seems thrown together, and ill-suited for one another, with the happy couple of Paul and Minta being flanked by the laconic Nancy, who would rather not be there at all, and the bitter and resentful Andrew, with Nancy and Andrew being forced together in a sense by their exclusion from the unit of Paul and Minta -- but Paul isn't *all* happy, and though the moment is in the past is stuck thinking about his proposal to Minta which he considers the worst moment of his entire life, and blames Mrs Ramsay for putting him up to it, resolving to complain to her about this - though he never actually does. This of course, seems entirely unlike the feelings of a man whose proposal has been accepted, though every other character presumes that they are now engaged, without either Paul or Minta having said so.

The main event of the section is the big dinner, which brings all of the characters together at last, although the action continues to remain in the heads and hearts of those characters, rather than at the dinner table.

As we lead up to the dinner, we see Mrs Ramsay transform with the help of her children. She puts a great deal of weight on the upcoming dinner, though no particular reason seems to exist for that importance. As she is dressed in her jewels and finery, and descends down to dinner, she sheds all of the characteristics we've come to know her by and becomes quite a bit more as the other characters see her, an imperial presence, the center of the universe that exists in this house. She is in control, dictates place and pairings and gives or withholds favor as she will, but inside she has deadened, seeming as though the function gives her no pleasure at all, but in taking the reins of conversation at the table regains some life. If she doesn't enjoy the job of it, she does like the game. 

If the novel thus far has been primarily Woolf trying to empathize with the fictionalized phantom of her mother, Woolf herself is most present in the character of Lily and we continue to see the artist compare and contrast herself with Mrs Ramsay, even while Mrs R also dissects Lily coming to favorable and critical conclusions both. While every character inhabits and embodies some part of Woolf's psyche, this particular axis between Mrs Ramsay and Lily seems the soul of the book to me.

Here we also see Tansley reveal his misogyny, and Lily go toe to toe with it, verbally teasing him as well as mentally sparring with his ideas, and gaining ground and confidence -- but ultimately giving it all up at a hint of admonishment from Mrs Ramsay, mostly itself imagined. We also see a similarity between Lily and Tansley here, where they both recognize the shallow nature of the exchanges going on at the table, and a contrast in how they deal with it. Tansley refuses to engage, but is pulled into it all by his ego, while Lily willingly partakes but keeps the core of herself aloof from it, which Mrs Ramsay seems also to do unconsciously.

Through all of this, and most of the dinner, Mr Ramsay is silent and uninvolved. There's something poignant in this that in a universe that revolves around Mrs Ramsay, only she herself seems to look at all to her husband, and she wishes that he would speak up and then she could really care about this all. She regards him in the same way everyone else regards her. Towards the end of the section, we see them truly and finally alone together and she still wants just the same thing, for him to speak, and he does and even though it is trivial it is just what she wanted, but in return all he wants is for her to say she loves him, and she knows this but she does not, feels she cannot, but that he must know it and resolves that he does and it is enough for him just to know, and feels that ""she had triumphed once again."" From her viewpoint, it seems almost perfectly romantic but when I imagine it from his, and as a husband I must, I can't help but feel crushed by this denial.

There's so much more than this, of course, and I can't wait to hear from you. Remember that discussion need not be contained to the scheduled threads, and to check out the Marginalia thread at any time to share thoughts on anything related to the novel.

Meanwhile, here's a few last bullet points:

- Your word of the week is **crepuscular**: (adj) of or resembling twilight.

- Minta uses Golden Haze. It's super-~~effective~~ attractive?

- Mrs Ramsay likes her boobies. (x-post to im14)

- Nobody actually enjoys Shakespeare, says Minta. Mr Ramsay replies that nobody enjoys it as much as they say they do, but that the texts have merit. With this in mind, how do you feel about Woolf?

Remember that the next section is extremely short, and so I've allotted a shorter period for those keeping to the schedule, so I'll see you again on Monday for the entirety of ""Time Passes."""

bookclub,"Hey!

So this week we'll read a poem by Yeats, which rhymes with Hates and not with Seats, as a non-native that was shocking haha.

We'll be talking about An Irish Airman foresees his death, and it's rather important to know the context in which it was written.

So without further ado. 

[How to read a poem by /u/surf_wax](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/7h6o9s/poem_of_the_week_the_love_song_of_j_alfred/) 

## [Here's the poem](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57311/an-irish-airman-foresees-his-death)

And the main points:

1. Initial, no-pressure read-through
2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem
3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.
4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?
5. What do you think the poem is about?
6. Favorite verses

---

### 1. Initial, no-pressure read-through

### 2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem

I honestly still don't get this poem, I know that I proposed this poem, but I'm still unsure about the motivations of the speaker of the poem. But let's go little by little.

The mood is quite... gloomy but also dreamy, it's not an immediate or imminent thing, he is not flying and going to die in a few seconds, he is probably imagining and coming to terms with the fact that one day, while flying in the war, he will die, which makes the poem feel a lot more deliberate and not desperate.

Also, Kiltartan is ""a barony and civil parish in County Galway, Ireland"" where Yeats used to stay.

### 3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.

The only thing I can say is that the rhymes happen within 4 verses so it would go ABAB CDCD EFEF etc.

### 4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?

So to me it feels like someone laid in the ground watching the clouds and thinking the poem to himself, a soliloquy of sorts.

### 5. What do you think the poem is about?

Ok, so let's talk about the historical context because I think it's rather important. The poem was written in the middle of the WWI and with almost all certainty refer to Major Robert Gregory, who while being Irish, fought for a British Air Squadron, so the whole

&gt;Those that I fight I do not hate,   
&gt;Those that I guard I do not love; 

Immediately starts to make more sense (also, do anyone gets a catch-22 vibe out of that?)

The speaker is completely apathetic about the ones that he guards and those who he has to kill, as the ones that he actually cares about (Kiltartan's poor) will gain or lose nothing when it came to the war.

&gt;No likely end could bring them loss    
&gt;Or leave them happier than before. 

Now, here's where I start to get lost: Seeing as how the speaker doesn't seem to care about defending his side nor killing the other, what is his motivation?

&gt;A lonely impulse of delight 

But what does that mean?

&gt;I balanced all, brought all to mind,    
&gt;The years to come seemed waste of breath,  
&gt;A waste of breath the years behind   
&gt;In balance with this life, this death.  

Is he being ironic or serious? It seems like it has some intrinsic importance to die fighting, but it's not actually mentioned, and as the speaker says, it wasn't a rash decision, but something thought thoroughly, so what is his motivation?

Thoughts?"

bookclub,"Alright, so now's the time for our first scheduled discussion. Groovy. So, here I am, coming off perhaps the longest, most exhausting week of my life as my son, six years old, has undergone and recovered from open heart surgery. As such, my notes for this week are utterly disgraceful. Ugly, sad things. I'm sure to have missed all sorts of things worth talking about.

Y'know, as if in better circumstances I could have *possibly* caught every stray thought and idea careening around this tempest of a novel. Ha.

So first, I'll begin with my general impression of the novel so far. This is the literary equivalent of those long awkward silences where nobody says anything so you are left to imagine what the other person is thinking, or perhaps more accurately but less commonly identifiable to more normal people those long nights I lie awake unable to sleep reflecting on old events and acquaintances and ascribing motivations and thoughts to them that are pulled more from my own neuroses than any actual information I have. This novel is like that on two levels. In the first, this is Virginia Woolf doing exactly that through fictionalized versions of her family and their companions. One the other, each character of the novel is also doing this to each other single character of the novel. What little dialogue passes between characters is largely shallow and meaningless, with the entirety of the real matter happening in the mind of a single character at a time. I got the real sense that if these characters would actually say anything to one another, much of the tension of the novel would be resolved instantly, and I'm reminded of a bit of pre-song banter by my hero Tom Lehrer:

&gt; Speaking of love, one problem that recurs more and more frequently these days, in books and plays and movies, is the inability of people to communicate with the people they love: husbands and wives who can't communicate, children who can't communicate with their parents, and so on. And the characters in these books and plays and so on, and in real life, I might add, spend hours bemoaning the fact that they can't communicate. I feel that if a person can't communicate, the very least he can do is to shut up.

There are also a ton of characters thrown at the reader in this first section, but for the most part they're all passing shadows and the book rests in the heads of just a few characters, who interact principally with only one other character at a time, and that only in a very shallow way.

Another general theme iterated frequently in the text is an almost worshipful reverence of the trappings of domesticity. Across many characters' inner lives we see both the having and lack of these features, and the ones who have them (Mr and Mrs Ramsay, mainly) feel a zealous obligation towards them, and the ones who do not, such as Lily Briscoe and William Bankes, feel profound envy towards them, and in the cases of Lily and Mr Ramsay, those feelings come almost in spite of themselves, as if they'd rather be another way but they *have* to have the feelings they do because it's expected of them.

Now to more specific matters:

One of the first things to hit me in the novel was the introduction of Tansley, from the point of view of Mrs Ramsay, as being chiefly an atheist, as if that said everything you needed to know about him as a person, and in a sense I came to see it that way as I continued to read the loose thread that follows Tansley through the earliest part of the novel, and as you see the quality applied by proxy to Mr Ramsay. I found the following quote to sum it up for both of them:

&gt; To pursue the truth with such astonishing lack of consideration for other people's feelings, to rend the veils of civilization so wantonly, so brutally, was to her so horrible an outrage of human decency . . . 

I realized here that Mrs Ramsay's assessment of atheism as a quality had nothing to do with religious belief in particular, but is a denigration to those who are so callous as to put facts in the place of faith, and particularly those who would dash her child's hopes. 

Tansley, in turn, is the first up to bat to demonstrate the feverish admiration that most of the characters will profess in their own turn towards Mrs Ramsay. All of these characters are 'in love' with Mrs R, or something she represents to them, and she in turn, well, she kind of seems to despise them all in small ways and for petty reasons. It's an interesting dynamic I don't think we've yet seem fully come to fruition, but where Tansley is concerned certainly we get Chapter 2, which proves that while Woolf tends to dance around from whim to notion and back to fancy in her prose, she's well capable of turning around and delivering a devastating sucker punch. Chapter 2 is so brief and pointed that I got a double whiplash with the sudden shift from Chapter 1 and back into Chapter 3.

Going back to Mrs Ramsay, in her we see Woolf's feminism defined by the particular prejudices the fictional matron feels about woman's place in the world, and the fealties owed to men. These are presented in a genuinely charitable light, as sincerely held beliefs, where it would have been so easy for Woolf to make her mother, through the character of Mrs Ramsay, seem pathetic and downtrodden for those views. Instead, the service and love of men and mankind gives Mrs Ramsay a strength and admirability that you'd never expect if your main preconception of Woolf was that of the literary hero of feminism. The one crack in that was the statement in regards to the worshipful love from men towards women that in her mind obligated women towards men: "" . . . woe betide the girl -- pray Heaven it was none of her daughters! -- who did not feel the worth of it . . ."" Of course, Woolf's actual mother *did* have at least one such daughter. However, it doesn't seem that Woolf at all condemns the woman, in her own time, who was happy with this sort of life, and rather than institutional revolution, feminism to Woolf, at least from this part of *Lighthouse*, seems a much more personal choice -- it was fine for her mother, but Woolf herself could not live that kind of life. Mrs Ramsay strikes again, though, in Chapter 8 when considering Augustus Carmichael's ""odious woman"" who is so cruel as to (maybe) manage the household budget and occasionally have a private chat woman to woman. It becomes plain that what regard Woolf had for her mother's views and choices was not returned in kind.

If Mrs Ramsay dominates this first half of ""The Window"", Lily Briscoe plays almost as large a part and was for me much more identifiable a character. In fact, it's hard to imagine any artist of any sort who does not sympathize with Lily's bemoaning ""But this is what I see!"" That feeling of not being able to communicate the feelings and images of your imaginings to your audience with any kind of adequacy must be nearly universal, and similar her feelings about actually having to have your work seen. Everything Lily said in regards to art hit me like a loaded freight train, even though there was nothing truly new to me in it and much of it is modern cliche, because it seems so much more genuinely represented in Lily than any newer media. Lily is also, with Mr Ramsay, one equal part of the novel's gut-wrenching portrayal of anxiety, which also resonates deeply with me. One of the lines that I particularly liked portrayed one of the prime anxiety symptoms - the feeling that everybody's got it more together than you do - in considering what it was that made her so different from someone so totally admirable and loved as she felt Mrs Ramsay must be, she determines that there's a secret that she has - that everyone has - that she doesn't, and says:

&gt; or did she lock up within her some secret which certainly Lily Briscoe believed all people must have for the world to go on at all? **Everyone could not be as helter skelter, hand to mouth as she was.** But if they knew, could they tell one what they knew?

Emphasis is mine. Additionally, there's a moment a bit earlier on where a memory, or the caricature that lives in her head, of Tansley reminds her that women cannot paint or write. Whether he ever said that precisely, or it's just implied by his attitude is not exactly clear, but it doesn't matter. I well know that voice, even if the words and the speaker are different.

So the other side of that is Mr Ramsay, who in the eyes of others comes off as utterly batshit crazy. Storming around shouting lines from ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"", and freezing like a deer in headlights and nearly exploding in rage whenever he's ""caught"" out - as if he were being subtle at all. Even in his own mind, he doesn't come off as particularly together, and the ""Q"" soliloquy doesn't seem to do him a single favor. 

But like Lily he is a creature defined by his self-perceived inadequacies, and in that I recognize myself as well. He tries to grasp his family life as a balm against the wounds of his lack of success. He wants badly to live out loud, but lacks any sort of courage and so like many of us who have extreme passion he downplays and self-deprecates and refers to his life's work as ""talking nonsense.""

It is interesting too, that Lily doesn't *recognize* their similar insecurities, and seems to think that these anxious mannerisms of his are ""little dodges"" to downplay what she sees as assured genius.

*A few bits of miscellany:* 
- Lily's ""chinese eyes"": well, that's pretty racist.
- Mrs R thinks of James's potential to be an artist, and refers to his forehead as being evidence of that. The story takes place *well* after phrenology has gone out of fashion.
- The way Bankes talks about his friendship with Mr Ramsay is the way most literature talks about dying marriages. They must have had the most epic of bromances.
- arid scimitar. arid scimitar. *arid scimitar*

Finally, I've said almost nothing on the subject of the central, but largely inert character of James. I've purposely saved this to the end. As I said earlier, I've spent this entire week with my young son in a hospital room, and especially the sight of him essentially comatose for two days after the surgery has deeply influenced my perception of a certain aspect of this book. Mr and Mrs Ramsay are very different sorts of parents, and if I had to say I'm much more like Mr R in parenting than I am like his wife. I believe firmly in telling the truth, and I'm not really very indulgent, but as I watched my son I felt a greater kinship with Mrs Ramsay's view of childhood than I ever might have done before hand. The thought that *he'll never be this happy again* seemed very real, as frightening thoughts of him never being as happy as he was before the surgery again creeped into my head - that the happiness of his youth might already be lost if anything was to go wrong. Like her, I thought that I wouldn't want to deny my child anything at all even, or especially the impossible, or at least the belief that what was probably impossible was just as likely as the predictable. Going into the surgery, I would have told him anything he wanted me too even if I knew it wasn't true, so as I read in the hours after I wanted, like Mrs R, to strike out at the 'atheists' for seeking to deny James even the *hope* of the lighthouse, even though I've certainly been a member of their ranks in the past, and will likely be more like them in the future. In these moments though, I found myself on her side and found her a much more sympathetic character than I might have predicted.


Whew.

I've said an awful lot, and now I need to hear from you! There's so much I know I didn't touch on, and I can't wait to hear what you all are taking away from this incredibly unique novel.

bookclub,"Memorial Day is done, it's hot as blazes (where I live), the kids are out of school--that can only mean one thing. It's summer! Which means it's time for our summer read. Well, reads. [Brothers Karamazov schedule is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/8l78wa/bros_karamazov_thread_schedules/) But we're here to read Dune! [This](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18519346-dune) is the edition I'm reading. It's 535 pages long, of which 489 are story--the rest are appendices and glossary. So it's not long. Your copy may be longer, but that's just because the print is bigger. I'll attempt to post on Fridays, but clearly I am not the most punctual of people, so don't hold me to that. So here's the schedule I'm anticipating. There are three books but no real chapters, just interludes of commentary, which are how we'll measure progress:

15 June: From the beginning up to and including the section starting with ""Many have marked the speed with which Muad'Dib learned the necessities of Arrakis.""   
22 June: From ""What had the Lady Jessica to sustain her in her time of trial?"" to ""Greatness is a transitory experience.""  
29 June: From ""There is no escape, we pay for the violence of our ancestors."" to the end of Book 1.  
6 July: Theme day! So American's don't have to read over 4 July.  
13 July: From the start of Book 2 to ""We came from Caladan--a paradise world for our form of life.""  
20 July: From ""Family life of the Royal Creche is difficult for many people to understand, but I shall try to give you a capsule view of it."" to ""My father, the Padishah Emperor, was 72 yet looked no more than 35 the year...""  
27 July: From ""God created Arrakis to train the faithful"" to the end of Book 2.  
3 August: From the start of Book 3 to ""When law and duty are one, united by religion, you never become fully conscious, fully aware of yourself.""  
10 August: Theme day!  
17 August: Just finish it.  
24 August: Appendices and Glossary  
31 August: Final Wrap  
7 September, if anyone wants to: Film adaptations and why they're all bad (or are they?)

*Fern Hill* by Dylan Thomas is the Poem of the week.  Here's a version with the wavy left margin similar to  the typeset copies \(I saw a few sites where it was printed left\-justified.\)

[https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/fern\-hill](https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/fern-hill)

In the comments for this thread, give your thoughts. Anything from a simple reaction like ""this line seems pointless"" to long analysis. Comment on anything you notice: you don't need an important insight to spark conversation.  An obvious\-seeming, three\-word comment like ""it's rural/farmy"" might spark elaboration by someone else.  The point is to brainstorm. Remark on repetitions, unusual words, lovely\-sounding lines, parts that don't make sense.  Below are a few questions to think about.  I'll put my own thoughts in the comments.

* What is the mood of the poem? Happy, regretful, anxious?
* What is the most vivid wording \-\- read it today, tomorrow post what you images you remember.  Read it tomorrow, in a few days post what you remember.
* Why is it called Fern Hill? \(would it be any different if it were called ""Berry Hill"" or ""Green Farm""\)
* Would you characterize it as dense/complex or simple\-seeming?
* Does the breaking up in stanzas signify something \-\- are there six discrete parts of the poem, or do you think there would be if you were deeply familiar with it?  What difference would it make if the stanzas were in different order?
* Are the phrases ""famous among the barns"" and ""honored among foxes and pheasants"" related to each other?
* What repeats \-\- what words come up over and over, what  phrases repeat; how would it be different if they didn't.

If you think of  similar questions, list them in the comments.

wiktionary dingle: A  small, narrow or enclosed, usually wooded valley.

wiktionary rick: A stack, stook or pile of grain, straw, hay etc., especially as protected with thatching.

wiktionary heydey: variant hayday \-\&gt; period of ascension, prime; but also, archaic ""An exultation of the spirits; gaiety; frolic."""
bookclub,"Hello, and welcome to the official start of our discussion of [Virginia Woolf's *To The Lighthouse*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59716.To_the_Lighthouse?from_search=true)

Please refer to the [schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/8lx4dw/to_the_lighthouse_schedule_june_2018/) for regular discussions, but feel free to contribute at any time. 

This thread is intended to catch all such discussion as doesn't fit specifically into one scheduled sectional thread, but also doesn't necessarily warrant its own individual posting. **Because of the potential depth and breadth of these topics, I'll be posting a comment chain below for social and introductory comments, so please keep all other top-level comments related to the novel.**

To promote discussion here, I'm including a number of potential veins of marginalia that may prove rich for discussion, some as suggested by my Oxford World's Classics edition's additional material. 

**Autobiographical Connections:** An important element of the novel's significance lies in the fact that the book seems to draw heavily from the actual facts of Woolf's childhood. The Oxford edition even goes so far as to state: ""No doubt our strongest idea of [Woolf's father] derives from the character of Mr Ramsay."" Woolf's life was as full of drama as any of her novels and the parallels between it and *To The Lighthouse* might be considered.

**Differing Initial Publications**: The novel appeared on both British and American shores from differing publishers on the very same day - 5 May 1927 - however, the two printings were far from identical. The prime differences are, of course, editorial in nature and most can be chalked up to differing preferences and a few to accident, but some exist that can be considered to change the character of the text. 

**Political and Social Themes**: Woolf is an author steeped in controversy, both admired and reviled in turns for her firmly stated stances, some of which seem contradictory or incompatible to the modern student. To many she is an icon of early feminism, and to others she is a pillar of classism and a vocal antisemite, despite her marriage to a Jewish man. Which sides of Woolf shine through in *To The Lighthouse*?


Now without further ado, to all those waiting impatiently you may consider this the starting gun. Ready, set, *read.*

bookclub,"Hello, all! 

This final chapter is so interesting to me. We have both the narrator and Billy, and the contrast between them. The narrator, well-off, is travelling with his friend back to Dresden. In the same moment, Billy is time-travelling, re-experiencing the corpse caves. Yet, the narrator is there, with Billy, back in Dresden, describing the horror. This makes me think the time-travelling really was PTSD, characterized by dissociation. What do you think? 

So, generally, what did you like or dislike about the book? What is your overall opinion? Any favorite parts or quotes? 

Finally: I am hoping to host a live chat on *Slaughterhouse-Five* in our discord. I think thinking Saturday evening or Sunday afternoon PDT. I'd like to get an idea of who is interested and the time frames people are available so we can try to pick a time that works for the most people.

bookclub,"l love this novel because it is inviting and beautiful and even sexual; because of the shapes of the words and paragraphs.  But it's mostly interior monologue. So if you have patience, and especially if you have compassion, then you will find something. This is a poor summary of how it describes our lives, our experiences. It is inimitable. A beautiful sentence from CH. 3

&gt; But here, as she turned the page, suddenly her search for the picture of a
rake or a mowing-machine was interrupted. The gruff murmur, irregularly
broken by the taking out of pipes and the putting in of pipes which had
kept on assuring her, though she could not hear what was said (as she sat
in the window which opened on the terrace), that the men were happily
talking; this sound, which had lasted now half an hour and had taken its
place soothingly in the scale of sounds pressing on top of her, such as
the tap of balls upon bats, the sharp, sudden bark now and then,
""How's that? How's that?"" of the children playing cricket, had ceased;
so that the monotonous fall of the waves on the beach, which for the most
part beat a measured and soothing tattoo to her thoughts and seemed
consolingly to repeat over and over again as she sat with the children
the words of some old cradle song, murmured by nature, ""I am guarding
you--I am your support,"" but at other times suddenly and unexpectedly,
especially when her mind raised itself slightly from the task actually in
hand, had no such kindly meaning, but like a ghostly roll of drums
remorselessly beat the measure of life, made one think of the destruction
of the island and its engulfment in the sea, and warned her whose day had
slipped past in one quick doing after another that it was all ephemeral as
a rainbow--this sound which had been obscured and concealed under the
other sounds suddenly thundered hollow in her ears and made her look up
with an impulse of terror."
bookclub,"Good evening! Here is our new voting thread for June poetry.

We're going to switch things up a bit -- /u/Earthsophagus is going to be introducing you to a less popular/more obscure poem every second week, starting with this Saturday.  There are two remaining Saturdays in May, so we will take the two poems with the highest number of votes.

Please, nominate several poems, including any that didn't get selected last time that you still want to see us do! One poem per comment so voting is easy, just like we do for novels. The only requirement is that the poem is freely available online (please provide a link), wasn’t written by you or your best friend, hasn't been done before, and isn’t super long — let’s use Christina Rosetti’s “Goblin Market” as a benchmark and keep it to ~575 lines or below for now. Aside from that, anything goes: any period, any poet, free verse or structured.

Voting will close on the evening of 6/5. Happy voting!"

Ok, so chapter 9. We have Billy lose his wife first. She loves him so much and it's so desperate to be by his side after his accident that she puts herself in danger and dies. 

We meet Rumfoord, who despises Billy. 

&gt; “All he does in his sleep is quit and surrender and apologize and ask to be left alone.”

I think this is related to why he doesn't want to speak to his son. 

&gt; He was all straightened out now. His posture was wonderful and his shoes were shined and his trousers were pressed, and he was a leader of men. 

&gt; “Dad—?” 

&gt; Billy Pilgrim closed his eyes again.

Do you think he's ashamed of himself? Proud of his son? Something else?

Most people think Billy is a vegetable, but his mind is reeling. He runs away from home to head to New York, where he finds Kilgore Trout's books again.

&gt; It was about an Earthling man and woman who were kidnapped by extra-terrestrials. They were put on display in a zoo on a planet called Zircon-212.

Montana plays a larger role here. At the same time as finding this book, he sees the ""What really became of Montana Wildhack?"". For the first time since starting the book, I've started to doubt his experiences with the Tralfamadorians. What do you think?"

### 1. Initial, no-pressure read-through

### 2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem

Ooooh boy, this is a heavy one, you guys should pick more merry poems to read haha.

I kinda feel like this poems speaks to us, one way or another, no matter if we've had actually somebody die that was important to us. We've all felt that pang of hurt after remembering that that someone important is no longer with us.

As for what caught my attention, I had never seen the Wind called impatient haha.

### 3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.

### 4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?

What I really like about the poem is that the speaker is not talking to us or himself, but rather the loved one, directly. He speaks of the terrible loneliness he has felt to the person missing, which is a lot more striking than just talking to himself.

### 5. What do you think the poem is about?

I think it's rather obvious that the speaker's loved one has passed away a while back, but he still gets those flashes where he doesn't remember that it is so.

At the same time he wonders how he could've lived without that strong pain of missing the loved one of always remembering that person.

I personally find it interesting, I think there's certain feeling of guilt when you notice for the first time you have forgotten for a while that that person is no longer there, even though it's perfectly normal and part of the process of continuing with your life.

### 6. Favorite verses

&gt;But how could I forget thee?—Through what power,  
Even for the least division of an hour,  
Have I been so beguiled as to be blind  
To my most grievous loss!—

So yeah, that's about it! Perhaps we will continue this, perhaps not. I don't know.

Cheers!

bookclub,"Hello!

To end our reading of Norwegian Wood, I wanted to give you some space to discuss how you felt about the book overall – any last thoughts, comments, or criticisms?

**Reviews**

I found a few reviews of the book to share, one [discussing the relationship between suicide and Japanese literature](http://mywrit340.blogspot.ca/2012/11/haruki-murakamis-norwegian-wood.html), one from [the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/24/books/rubber-souls.html), and one [from The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/06/winter-reads-norwegian-wood-haruki-murakami) about suicide and winter. 

**Toru and Naoko**

I also found a short [analytical essay](https://digitalcommons.augustana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&amp;context=wollstonecraftaward) about the one-sidedness of Toru’s love for Naoko. To me, Toru’s devotion to Naoko felt like it came out of nowhere, not like the way we saw him fall in love with Midori. It felt like he loved Naoko out of a duty to Kizuki more than anything else, and that he glossed over her suffering because he was so enamoured by her. What did you think of their relationship?

**Discussion**

Here are two past reddit threads discussing the novel, both raising very interesting questions. The [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/36vo02/disappointed_by_murakamis_norwegian_wood/) talks about the likeability and believability of the characters, and the [second](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3at4vo/finished_norwegian_wood_as_my_first_leisure_read/) talks about Toru and Reiko, and has interesting comments about Reiko’s role and the way the characters exploit each other to cope with grief.

Personally, I was surprised at how different the book was from my memory of it at 17. This time, I found the characters a lot less likeable, I was frustrated by their inability to communicate with each other, and the underlying sexism was a lot more apparent. I still found the writing beautiful, but the story felt more tragic than nostalgic and a lot of the deaths were almost arbitrary in a way I couldn’t justify. I know it may have been left out on purpose, but I wish we had been given more information about why certain characters killed themselves, instead of just seeing the effect that their deaths had on those who kept living. What were your experiences? Did anyone find it was different upon rereading it?

bookclub,"The following is the schedule for your June 2018 selection, [*To The Lighthouse* by Virginia Woolf.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59716.To_the_Lighthouse)

Date|Topic
:-:|:-:
1 June|Marginalia
6 June|The Window, Chapters 1 - 10
13 June|The Window, Chapters 11 - 19
18 June|Time Passes
25 June|The Lighthouse
29 June|Criticism, Reviews &amp; Summations

The novel is not very long, and this schedule shouldn't prove too demanding for any level of reader with each segment less than fifty pages, and Time Passes being considerably shorter than the rest. (As a result, a few days less are allotted for that.) As always, keeping to the prescribed schedule isn't necessary, and additional discussion is both welcome and encouraged.

*On availability*: Many editions exist of *To The Lighthouse* at a great variety of price points, but digital editions are available on both Kindle and Nook for as little as $0.99. Additionally, while the book is not considered public domain in the United States, it is in other English speaking countries including Australia and Canada and is thus available for free through some Australian and Canadian venues such as [this University of Adelaide edition](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91t) as well as one available as a download from the book's Goodreads page. Reddit is an international community, so keep in mind your local laws and use your own discretion when accessing these resources.

Additionally, while it shouldn't impact enjoyment or discussion it may be useful to note if your copy is based on the first British or first American pressings of the novel, as some differences both superficial and substantial do exist. More details will be included in the Marginalia thread.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to experiencing this book with all of you."
bookclub,"Hi! Let's get right into this.

&gt;There are almost no characters in this story, and almost no dramatic confrontations, because most of the people in it are so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces.

I know this is a complaint of some readers so I'd like to bring it up. Do you think this is the case? How do you think this adds or detracts from the story? 

The next thing  want to talk about is Kilgore Trout. This man wrote books that inspired Billy, even if it is not necessarily to create the Tralfamadorians. I feel like he is a big part of who Billy becomes. Way back in Chapter 5 Vonnegut says that because of the war, Rosewater and Billy ""were trying to reinvent themselves and their universe. Science fiction was a big help."" What do you think? How do you see the friendship between Billy and Trout? \(Side note, loved the money tree\). 

I liked Maggie White and her birth control, but the fact that she believes advertisers don't lie makes me sad. 

I'd like to know more about Robert and his pink guitar. With his immense sadness, and thinking about the time frame, I'm inclined to think he's hinting he's gay. What do you think?

Alright looking forward to hearing from you! "

If you’ve just finished the book, congratulations! What did you all think about the ending? I have some things I wanted to discuss but feel free to talk about anything, as usual!

**Death and grief**

First, we have Naoko’s suicide, which comes after her final visit to Reiko at the sanatorium. I wasn’t really surprised about her decision, since it felt like she had given up fighting a long time ago. What was interesting was Toru’s reaction, almost trying to erase himself in his attempt to cope with the loss. 

I thought there were some very well written sections here:

&gt; The memories would slam against me like the waves of an incoming tide, sweeping my body along to some strange new place - a place where I lived with the dead. There Naoko lived, and I could speak with her and hold her in my arms. Death in that place was not a decisive element that brought life to an end. There, death was but one of many elements comprising life. There Naoko lived with death inside her. And to me she said, ""Don't worry, it's only death. Don't let it bother you.”

&gt; I had learned one thing from Kizuki's death, and I believed that I had made it a part of myself in the form of a philosophy: ""Death exists, not as the opposite but as a part of life."" By living our lives, we nurture death. True as this might be, it was only one of the truths we had to learn. 

&gt; What I learned from Naoko's death was this: no truth can cure the sadness we feel from losing a loved one. No truth, no sincerity, no strength, no kindness, can cure that sorrow. All we can do is see that sadness through to the end and learn something from it, but what we learn will be no help in facing the next sadness that comes to us without warning. 

And Reiko:

&gt; ""If you feel some kind of pain with regard to Naoko's death, I would advise you to keep on feeling that pain for the rest of your life. And if there's something you can learn from it, you should do that, too. But quite aside from that, you should be happy with Midori. Your pain has nothing to do with your relationship with her. If you hurt her any more than you already have, the wound could be too deep to fix.”

&gt; ""I'm finished as a human being,"" she said. ""All you're looking at is the lingering memory of what I used to be. The most important part of me, what used to be inside, died years ago, and I'm just functioning by auto-memory.""

**Relationships**

A lot of relationships are explored in this chapter: Reiko wearing Naoko’s clothes after she dies, Reiko and Toru sleeping together, Toru talking about how he abandoned Naoko in her time of need, Toru ignoring Midori for weeks and then finally reaching out to her. What did you think of all these relationships and the different ways the characters communicated, or failed to communicate with each other? Where do they go from here?

Some passages I liked:

&gt; “We were alive, she and I. And all we had to think about was continuing to live.”

&gt; ""I have to talk to you,"" I said. ""I have a million things to talk to you about. A million things we have to talk about. All I want in this world is you. I want to see you and talk. I want the two of us to begin everything from the beginning."" 

&gt; Midori responded with a long, long silence - the silence of all the misty rain in the world falling on all the new-mown lawns of the world.”

**Food**

Another theme running through the novel was the characters’ relationships with food, especially Midori’s. I found an [interesting article](https://www.theawl.com/2017/02/haruki-murakamis-metaphysics-of-food/) about food in Murakami’s novels, touching on how relationships are built while sharing food in Norwegian Wood.

**Music**

In this chapter we see Reiko play 51 songs for Naoko’s funeral. I wanted to share [this link](https://medium.com/murakami-s-music/murakami-s-music-norwegian-wood-ce5aeb28f5dd) to all of the songs mentioned throughout the novel, in case you wanted to listen to any!

[This link](http://norwegianwood.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/norwegian-wood-in-music/) breaks down the lyrics of the song *Norwegian Wood* and makes connections to the story. It’s obviously just one person’s interpretation but I thought it would be nice to revisit the song again as we finish the book!

See you next time for our review thread!

bookclub,"Hey guys. 

I didn't care for this chapter, and I find myself struggling to find anything to say about it at all. That really bothers me. As a result, I think we should discuss general themes. 

Death is an obvious theme here. We see the death of ""a Pole"" in Dresden, the death of Billy's father-in-law in the airplane, the death of ""all the real soldiers""... And that's just this chapter. I have come to find the phrase ""So it goes,"" comforting. Death is inevitable, which leads me to another theme. 

War. Billy said in an earlier chapter than the Tralfamadorians viewed war as inevitable and that they choose not to look at the bad parts of their timelines. Billy, on the other hand, is forced to look at each part of his timeline, sometimes repeatedly, and has no control. I think this relates to Vonnegut's idea that we do not have free will. What do you think? Am I way off base?

Finally, truth. The narrator blatantly says, time travel is true, the naked girls are real, and the syrup that brings tears to their eyes is true. It's the simple things, I suppose, especially when you have nothing else. Do you think there is more meaning here than in gathering?"

bookclub,"Hey everyone! 

Sorry for the delay, it's been a pretty crazy weekend and I wanted to re-read this long poem to have it fresh in my mind!

So here we go.

[How to read a poem by /u/surf_wax](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/7h6o9s/poem_of_the_week_the_love_song_of_j_alfred/) 

## [""Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came"" by Robert Browning](http://www.bartleby.com/246/654.html)

And the main points:

1. Initial, no-pressure read-through
2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem
3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.
4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?
5. What do you think the poem is about?
6. Favorite verses

---

### 1. Initial, no-pressure read-through

So I know that this poem is long and kinda old, so it may be not be incredibly easy to read (especially if you are not native), but it's definitely worth it in my opinion. Try to re-read sections if you do not understand them, but don't despair! No pressure hah.

### 2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem

So the mood... The mood is so great in this poem, the first line catches you off guard and puts you immediately in a defensive stance: 

&gt; My first thought was, he lied in every word,

and if that wasn't enough, the poem immediately assaults you with a terrible image

&gt; That hoary cripple, with malicious eye

And unlike Poe's ""The Tell-tale Heart"" the eye and the expression of this ""hoary cripple"" is not innocent and in your mind, it's definitely there, in the middle of the road, waiting for you and anyone who passes to ask where the Dark Tower is.

The mood is depressing, it's dark. What I love about this poem is that the imagery is so vivid that I am there, seeing this desperate not-yet-knight young man wading through misery, tired, so tired that any end at this point is better than continuing wandering.

&gt;I hardly tried now to rebuke the spring	   
&gt;My heart made, finding failure in its scope.

At the same time, somehow the poem evokes the sense of the epic, just like Tennyson's Ulysses, of something larger than life through the struggles of one man. But maybe that's just me.

### 3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.

### 4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?

It's a story, interestingly enough told first person in the past tense, making you feel like you are hearing this person tell his tale of woe, but of triumph.

### 5. What do you think the poem is about?

Honestly I'm not sure if there is anything too symbolic about it, I find it almost like an exercise on creating a mood and telling a story.

### 6. Favorite verses

There are many that I really like:

&gt;As for the grass, it grew as scant as hair	 
&gt;In leprosy; thin dry blades prick’d the mud	  
&gt;Which underneath look’d kneaded up with blood.  

I mean, if that does not put in a terrible image in your head I think you need to work on your imagination/visualization hahah

&gt;I hardly tried now to rebuke the spring	 
&gt;My heart made, finding failure in its scope.

I know I already put these two verses, but they are just so good! It shows such desperation, and suffering, it's so descriptive.

&gt; Not hear? when noise was everywhere! it toll’d	
&gt;  Increasing like a bell. Names in my ears	
&gt;  Of all the lost adventurers my peers,—	        
&gt;How such a one was strong, and such was bold,	  
&gt;And such was fortunate, yet each of old	  
&gt;  Lost, lost! one moment knell’d the woe of years.

So what do you think about the poem and the points talked about?

That's it,

Cheers!

Edit: Oh boy the title is terrible, sorry about that."
bookclub,"Hello and welcome to our chapter 9-10 discussion! I'm away for the long weekend so this will be short but feel free to post about anything you'd like. Here's [the month's scheduled posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/8fv450/norwegian_wood_schedule_may_2018_selection/).

What did you guys think about the progression of Toru's relationship with Midori? And what it reveals about their personalities?

Are you worried about Naoko's declining mental health? Do you think she will ever truly get better and leave the sanatorium? What did you make of Toru's reaction to Reiko's letter?

In this chapter we saw Toru moving out and pursuing his own interests - I thought that was a lot more engaging than watching him pine over Naoko and Midori. He seems to be developing more of a will to live meaningfully, independent of the relationships he is in. I think the conversation he has in his head with Kizuki is a turning point for him in deciding not to give up.

&gt;Hey, there, Kizuki, I thought. Unlike you, I've chosen to live—and to live the best I know…I'm going to mature. I'm going to be an adult. Because that's what I have to do. I always used to think I'd like to stay seventeen or eighteen if I could. But not anymore. I'm not a teenager any more. I've got a sense of responsibility now. I'm not the same guy I was when we used to hang out together. I'm twenty now. And I have to pay the price to go on living.

I thought this section of the book was really quotable - I'd love to hear your favourite passages from it, or from anywhere in the book up until this point!

Here are a couple of mine from chapter 9-10:

&gt;""But who can say what's best? That's why you need to grab whatever chance you 
have of happiness where you find it, and not worry about other people too much. My experience tells me that we get no more than two or three such chances in a life time, and if we let them go, we regret it for the rest of our lives.""

&gt;""What a terrible thing it is to wound someone you really care for - and to do it so unconsciously.""

&gt;""I wrote a huge number of letters that spring: one a week to Naoko, several to Reiko, and several more to Midori. I wrote letters in the classroom, I wrote letters at my desk at home with Seagull in my lap, I wrote letters at empty tables during my breaks at the Italian restaurant. It was as if I were writing letters to hold together the pieces of my crumbling life.""

That's all for now! See you guys at chapter 11! "
bookclub,"Hi there! Guest discusser...discussionat-...guest person here today!

A few things jumped out at me as I went through this chapter. First was Lazzaro's description of what he did to that dog. From his description, and how the narrator describes him as he talks about it, it seems evident to me that Lazzaro is a psychopath. And what he describes is certainly one of the more horrifying images in the book, which is strange considering the horrors of WWII. Am I misreading this? Because it seems like Vonnegut was making a point that, as horrible and senseless as war is, individuals can be just has horrible and senseless.

I really appreciated the irony and contrast of Billy being ""Cinderella"" in the country where the fable was first recorded while the German homeless man, in death, mirrored the very actions and considerations of the soldiers the night before. 

Here's the big question: Billy knows he shouldn't mess with the two lumps in his jacket, as they will bring him great fortune. So why does he pull them out in Dresden, in the face of an annoyed doctor? He knows what will happen in Dresden, but he also knows he will not die there. Maybe he feels he doesn't need the miracles the tooth and diamond will bring him, but how can he be sure that the miracles they are supposed to work aren't what keep him alive through the bombing? Essentially, how does Billy, as a victim of time jumping, not develop a completely carefree attitude as he knows whatever situation he's in, or action he takes, will still get him to the same place in the end? 

Is there anything else I didn't cover that you found interesting?

bookclub,"Hey guys,

Sorry for the delay. Life got in the way. I am posting on mobile, so please forgive any errors. I'll try to get to a computer soon to fix anything I miss. Anyway, here is the scheduled post for *Slaughterhouse-Five*. 

* One thing that surprised me this chapter is we get confirmation Billy and they narrator are two different people. And the narrator shits out his brains. Why do you think Vonnegut put this in? Why do you think it mattered to him at all? 

* My favorite line from this chapter was: ""It was very exciting for her, taking his dignity away in the name of love."" For me, it defines so many codependent relationships. Also, I'm dealing with aging parents, and an ill grandmother who is struggling to care for herself and this line reminded me to be sure to respect them ass I'm making decisions for their care. 

* That memo by Howard Campbell hit me hard: ""America is the wealthiest nation on Earth, but its people are mainly poor, and poor Americans are urged to hate themselves."" I think this seems pretty accurate. What do you think? He was a fictional character; no one by that name released a memo similar to that. So Vonnegut see this happening as he's writing this book. Do you think anything has changed over the years? People who have experienced other cultures, what do you think?

* ""Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt."" I mean, wow. 

I find I am identifying far more than I expected with Billy, and even the Tralfamadorians... Death is inevitable and there is nothing you can do to change anything. So it goes. What about you? Do you find the book largely optimistic, pessimistic, or realistic? Something else? How are you finding it?"
bookclub,Here is the second part of my video about Norwegian Wood and how it deals with grief.  Here I go deeper into what happens to Wanatabe towards the end of the book:https://youtu.be/DT-qM_QtEZw
bookclub,"Hi and welcome back! Today we’ll be discussing chapters 7-8, but feel free to talk about anything up until this point in the novel. Here's the [discussion schedule.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/8fv450/norwegian_wood_schedule_may_2018_selection/)

**Midori’s dad**

Did anyone else cry when Midori’s father died? I was amazed that I felt so attached to him even though he is only in the book for a short chapter. I really liked the connection that developed between him and Toru. When he sat with her father alone, there was a lot of potential for awkwardness, but instead we get a heartwarming interaction that ends with Midori’s father asking Toru to take care of his daughter (at which point I figured that might be the last time we see him). In a letter to Naoko, Toru writes:

&gt; ""I still have a vivid memory of the tiny crunching he made when he chewed his pieces of cucumber. People leave strange little memories of themselves behind when they die.""

I love this part of the book because it’s very revealing of Toru’s character – he’s empathetic towards someone in a very vulnerable state, he doesn’t talk down to him, he can sense the love that Midori has for her father even though she is exhausted from taking care of her dying relatives. Maybe part of this sensitivity comes from the loss he’s experienced in his own life and his understanding of pain. It’s a nice change from the apathy we’ve been seeing so much of. 

**The student revolution**

In this section we also get Midori’s rant about the pointlessness and hypocrisy of the student revolution. She says:

&gt; ""’What is this imperialist exploitation stuff you're talking about? Is it connected somehow to the East India Company?' ‘Does smashing the educational-industrial complex mean we're not supposed to work for a company after we graduate?' And stuff like that. But nobody was willing to explain anything to me. Far from it - they got really angry.

&gt; What kind of revolution is it that just throws out big words that working-class people can't understand? What kind of crap social revolution is that? I mean, I'd like to make the world a better place, too. If somebody's really being exploited, we've got to put a stop to it. That's what I believe, and that's why I ask questions.”

What did you think of her frustration with the student politics at her university? Did you find it a relatable experience?

I also think this comes into play in Toru’s conversation with Nagasawa about what hard work truly entails. For Midori, it’s the work of running her family business just to scrape a living. For Nagasawa, that’s not enough.

&gt; Amazed at the harshness of his tone, I looked at Nagasawa. ""The way I see it, people are working hard. They're working their fingers to the bone. Or am I looking at things wrong?"" 

&gt; ""That's not hard work. It's just manual labour,"" Nagasawa said with finality. ""The ""hard work' I'm talking about is more self-directed and purposeful."" 

&gt; ""You mean, like studying Spanish while everyone else is taking it easy?"" 

&gt; ""That's it. I'm going to have Spanish mastered by next spring. I've got English and German and French down pat, and I'm almost there with Italian. You think things like that happen without hard work?"" 

&gt; Nagasawa puffed on his cigarette while I thought about Midori's father. There was one man who had probably never even thought about starting Spanish lessons on TV. He had probably never thought about the difference between hard work and manual labour, either. He was probably too busy to think about such things - busy with work, and busy bringing home a daughter who had run away to Fukushima.

What did you think of these contrasting ideas of hard work? I thought they were very revealing of the characters’ values and motivations. It also added to my frustration with Nagasawa because in order to take on a perspective like his, you have to have been born into enough wealth that the idea of manual labour for survival doesn’t even cross your mind. In this section, he struck me as incredibly arrogant and self-serving, and I was disappointed Toru did nothing to challenge his opinions. 

**Nagasawa**

In this section we learn more about Nagasawa’s relationship with Hatsumi, and we get to hear his thoughts on why he and Toru get along so well. Earlier in the month, someone pointed out that Nagasawa would be the evolution of Kizuki, if Kizuki had lived past 17. We actually see Nagasawa compare himself to a character here, and it’s not Kizuki, but Toru. 

&gt; ""We're a lot alike, though, Watanabe and me,"" said Nagasawa. ""Neither of us is interested, essentially, in anything but ourselves. OK, so I'm arrogant and he's not, but neither of us is able to feel any interest in anything other than what we ourselves think or feel or do. That's why we can think about things in a way that's totally divorced from anybody else. That's what I like about him. The only difference is that he hasn't realized this about himself, and so he hesitates and feels hurt.""

Do you agree with the comparison? What are your thoughts?

One more thing about Nagasawa, and the book overall – is anyone noticing how much sexism there is in the novel? I don’t know if it’s intentional on the author’s behalf in order to evoke the environment of the 60s, or if it’s just what he considers a normal treatment of women, but I’m bothered by the attitudes towards women in the novel. From the comments about Midori’s skirt to the objectification of women to Nagasawa’s blasé treatment of his cheating on Hatsumi “because that’s the kind of man I am,” I really feel like there’s a prevalent attitude of disrespect and a view that women are inferior. Does this bother anyone else? How do you view it within the story?

**Hatsumi**

The last thing I wanted to discuss was Hatsumi, who kills herself four years after the dinner with Toru and Nagasawa. 

&gt; I had forgotten the existence of such innocent, all-but-seared-in longing: forgotten for years that such feelings had ever existed inside me. What Hatsumi had stirred in me was a part of my very self that had long lain dormant. And when the realization struck me, it aroused such sorrow I almost burst into tears. She had been an absolutely special woman. Someone should have done something - anything - to save her. But neither Nagasawa nor I could have managed that. 

What is the longing that Toru is describing? And why do you think he views her death as inevitable? Were you frustrated by the way her life ended and how attached she was to someone who treated her like shit? Let us know!

That’s everything I have for now!

bookclub,"Wow, you guys, you really want to read *Dune*. It had 14 more upvotes than any other single nomination this go-round. I'm eager to read this with you, and I've just grabbed my copy from the Kindle store.

Those of you joining us should be able to find this easily, either at the library or in mass market paperback, often at used bookstores. There's a Kindle edition for $10, and I'd imagine most libraries that use Overdrive will have electronic copies available to borrow. Since we will be taking three months to read this, you may want to buy your own copy.

Schedule forthcoming -- I'm heading out on vacation imminently, but I'll use some of that time to come up with a schedule. *Dune* isn't incredibly long, so we're going to be a bit relaxed about how we go about this. There's a lot to talk about, though, don't worry -- I think we can fill that time up nicely."
bookclub,"Welcome to another chapter discussion for [Norwegian Wood](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/8fv450/norwegian_wood_schedule_may_2018_selection/)! How do you feel about the book now that we’re at the halfway point? 

A lot has gone down in the last couple chapters (sorry for the delayed post! I didn’t realize how long chapter 6 would be and I was travelling this weekend without my laptop), and we have tons to unpack. I’m not even sure where to start, but let’s go with what we discover about Naoko and Kizuki.

**Naoko and Kizuki**

Chapter 6 shed some much needed light on the relationship between Naoko and Kizuki, highlighting the ups and downs and giving us a bit of clarity regarding Kizuki’s death. I was particularly moved by the way Naoko phrased it here:

&gt; ""Because we would have had to pay the world back what we owed it,"" she said, raising her eyes to mine. ""The pain of growing up. We didn't pay when we should have, so now the bills are due. Which is why Kizuki did what he did, and why I'm here. We were like kids who
grew up naked on a desert island. If we got hungry, we'd just pick a banana; if we got lonely, we'd go to sleep in each other's arms. But that kind of thing doesn't last forever.”

How did you feel about Naoko’s explanation for Kizuki’s suicide and her reasoning behind their friendship with Toru? Were you surprised by it? Did it feel inevitable or avoidable? What do you think is the cost of growing up?

One thing I’m struck by is how Toru and Naoko keep using each other as proxies for Kizuki. It doesn’t seem healthy or sustainable at all and I feel like the foundation of their relationship is their desire to keep him alive, in a sense.

I was also interested in Naoko’s sister’s story. We hear about how perfect her life seemed and how similar her death was to Kizuki’s. It breaks my heart that Naoko has been surrounded by these tragedies, that she has lost the people closest to her so suddenly and without any explanation or closure. How do you feel about her as a character now that we’ve learned more of her backstory? Has anything changed? What about her relationship with Toru?

**Reiko**

In chapter 6 we meet Reiko, Naoko’s housemate at the Ami Hostel. I thought she was an interesting addition to the cast of characters. The author creates a lot of sympathy for her, allowing us to meet her through Toru before hearing her story, and letting her tell it the way she chooses to. How do you feel about her? Did you see her as a victim or a perpetrator? Do you think she is being completely honest in her account of what happened with her student?

**Miscellaneous**

&gt; ""That song can make me feel so sad,"" said Naoko. ""I don't know, I guess I imagine myself wandering in a deep wood. I'm all alone and it's cold and dark, and nobody comes to save me.”

-	Norwegian Wood comes up in this section, with Naoko requesting that Reiko play it for her on the guitar! Was it how you expected it to be included, given the introduction it gets in the first chapter? 

&gt; “We are in here not to correct the deformation but to accustom ourselves to it […] That's what distinguishes us from the outside world: most people go about their lives unconscious of their deformities, while in this little world of ours the deformities themselves are a precondition.”

-	What did you think of Ami Hostel and its philosophy? Do you agree with its method of treatment? I think it’s very valuable in theory, and it's basically a sheltered paradise, but it seems to be the kind of place that only functions well in isolation from the rest of society – it doesn’t run with the goal of reintegration in mind (which isn’t to say that that’s necessary, it’s just something I noticed).
-	I’m loving the references: to musicians from the 1960s, Salinger, Fitzgerald – this book is really grounded in nostalgia and it feels very realistically set in the past (if a little heavy-handed at times). One book that comes up a lot is [The Magic Mountain,]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Mountain) which I hadn’t heard of but it’s about a man who visits his sick wife in a sanatorium in Switzerland, in case you were also curious!

That’s all I have for now, as always please feel free to discuss anything you want from this section of the book!

[How to read a poem by /u/surf_wax](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/7h6o9s/poem_of_the_week_the_love_song_of_j_alfred/) 

## [Here's the poem](https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/stolen-child)

And the main points:

1. Initial, no-pressure read-through
2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem
3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.
4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?
5. What do you think the poem is about?
6. Favorite verses

### 1. Initial, no-pressure read-through

### 2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem

So first of all I should say that according to Wikipedia it's:

&gt;The poem is based on Irish legend and concerns faeries beguiling a child to come away with them.

Now, I think this is rather important to understand the poem. First, because there are some references to Irish locations (Rosses and Glen-Car). And second because the description of where they want the Child to go is not bad at all, but the title is not The Lost Child, is The Stolen Child, so without context you can only kinda guess that maybe the description of the faery place is not entirely honest? But if it's ""beguiling"" then maybe there's more of a foundation for that distrust.

### 3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.

### 4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?

As said above I think there's the description of this idyllic place to entice the child and tries to compare it with the suffering of the real world.

### 5. What do you think the poem is about?

Not sure how many times I can repeat the same thing haha, but I will add something to the above. I find it a bit weird how in the end the real world, after being described as ""full of weeping"" is suddenly portrayed in a good light:

&gt;He'll hear no more the lowing  
&gt;Of the calves on the warm hillside  
&gt;Or the kettle on the hob  
&gt;Sing peace into his breast,  

and yet with barely any change to the repeating four verses.

### 6. Favorite verses

Because of how it sounds I really like:

&gt;We foot it all the night,  
&gt;Weaving olden dances  
&gt;Mingling hands and mingling glances  
&gt;Till the moon has taken flight;  

That's about it.

Cheers!"
bookclub,"SPOILERS up front just in case, but I hope people in the thread have read the book.

My initial impression is I'm unsure what to make of it all. I enjoyed uncovering the chief mysteries of what exactly is the entertainment, who is madame psychosis, and what is going on in the concavity. 

That said, there are a few questions I must not have read closely enough to have answered. What was the point of James Incandenza visiting Don Gately and the poltergeist activity at the academy? I'm curious why the book had to end on such a violent end, with Orin's and Fax's deaths? What was the deal with the giant baby in the concavity? Is the reader to assume that the entertainment ended up released into ONAN sometime after the end of the book? I have a few inklings of ideas, but I'd like to hear other opinions. 

The book has a lot of disfigured or deformed characters and unflinching depictions of the depths of addiction and withdrawal which I found a little uncomfortable. I found only one part of the book actually funny and one part pitch black humorous. 

Finally, I feel that the list of James Incandenza's films could act as a sort of cypher to the book, despite a passage in the book claiming many of the films to be meaningless, because a lot of them track with much of the narrative and characters introduced in the story and can sort of act as a point of comparison and, funnily enough, a lens to look at the events of the story from a new angle.

It's a fine story with an interesting take on family, fame, love, addiction, coping, politics, art and a myriad of other things. Is there a big part of the story that I hadn't touched on?  Is there something Wallace absolutely intended to get across with his book? Do you have a take on what I might have missed in the book?

I'm going to read Journey to the East by Hesse now before starting on Don Quixote and then something a little more contemporary after that."
bookclub,"I'd like to take some time discussing a very big theme of this book, time travel and the existence of free will. The last part of the book has the alien telling Pilgrim that Earth is the only place he'd been that even had a concept of free will. 

Up until this point in the book, we have seen Billy sort of carried along through life. Everything is sort of laid out for him, if not by the military (Weary is a great example of that), then by his father-in-law, or his family, or the Tralfmadorians. He really doesn't make choices. He also can't seem to control when he travels through time, or to when. Why do you think this is? Does it have anything to do with just wanting to hammer home the idea of no free will? Or is it deeper than that? 

I do want to acknowledge that most of the time travel seems to occur during high-stress moments, but I don't think that limits the possibility of him becoming ""unstuck"" as actually happening. Thoughts? 

Feel free to discuss these points or any others that come to your mind. :) I would like to know what you guys think of this time travel stuff though. "
bookclub,"Japan has very different attitudes toward pedophilia (don’t @ me about ephebophilia, I’m not interested in making a distinction here — 13 is a child no matter how physically mature) than a lot of the rest of the world. I suspect that Murakami intended Reiko to come off as a victim, but I can only see an adult who was charged with supervising a minor and who failed to be an adult in that situation. If Murakami was a western author, I’d also be questioning Reiko’s version of events, and *why* she’s been in the sanitorium for so long. Did she change things to make herself more sympathetic? Does she stay away because she’s afraid she’ll abuse her daughter?

But Murakami is… Murakami. In *Kafka on the Shore* he has 15-year-old Kafka with his weird Jocasta complex, boning a woman he thinks might be his mother but then again is not? Given this and the part of Japanese culture that treats pedophilia as way less of a big thing than the English-speaking world does, I think it’s unlikely that we’re supposed to see anything wrong with it.

I am reluctant to read any more Murakami after this. I feel dirty. I’m not one to boycott problematic authors, but there are so many other good books out there which *aren’t* going to hit me over the head with a blasé treatment of child sexual abuse.

(Also, what *possible* reason is there to include this? Can anyone tie it symbolically toward anything else in the story? I’m squicked the fuck out but also willing to examine it from a literary perspective... things can have literary significance and still be deeply problematic at the same time.)"

bookclub,"Hello and welcome to our discussion of chapters 3 and 4! I hope you’ve all been enjoying the book so far.

Here is a list of things that stood out to me in no particular order, but as always, feel free to discuss anything you like!

- Nagasawa and Hatsumi – two interesting characters we meet in Chapter 3. I feel like their relationship is sort of set up to contrast Kizuki and Naoko’s. What do you think of them? 
- Naoko’s departure and letter to Toru, the way she says “You are not the one who hurt me. I myself am the one who did that” (44). What exactly did she do to hurt herself? I think it relates to her depression following Kizuki’s suicide, but it’s a very interesting way to phrase things. 
- I was wondering what a [zelkova tree](http://www.winterhill.com.au/trees/range/150/Japanese%20Elm/) looked like, so here are some images if you were curious as well!
- The way Toru criticizes the students at his university for the strike is giving me major Holden Caulfield vibes! Lots of angst and dissatisfaction, but he never comes up with a solution better than the one he is criticizing. 
- Midori! What do you guys think of her? She’s probably my favourite character in the book so far – she’s likeable, headstrong, and vibrant. She is the polar opposite of Naoko in so many ways. And she seems to draw Toru out in a way that makes his personality more apparent than it was before – he felt very shapeless up until he met her. Midori is the one person that I believe might shake Toru out of his way of seeing things, and help him readjust to living a meaningful life in the wake of Kizuki's death. I'm excited to see more of her. I especially liked this quote of hers:

&gt; “Just once, I wanted to know what it was like to get my fill of it – to be fed so much love I couldn’t take any more. Just once. But they never gave that to me.” (76)

bookclub,"Hey guys! How goes it? Are you enjoying your reading so far? 

I came out of this chapter with a few things I noticed in this text, things that struck me deeply or confused me. I'll highlight those items and see if we match on anything. I also want to see what meant a lot to you, or confused you. :) 

* Princess, the German Shepard. Is that ironic or what? She's completely unprepared for war, just a farmer's dog. 

* Why were the shots that killed the scouts ""inoffensive""? I would think those would be the most offensive. Maybe it's just that they were so far away they barely warranted a reaction? Maybe it is because Billy is so sick? Maybe it has something to do with our focus being elsewhere, or Billy having not bonded with the scouts, or the scouts having just left them? I'm unsure. Do you have an opinion? 

* When Vonnegut discusses the Black ""ghetto"" in Ilium, I am surprised to see him use the phrase, ""It was all they had and they wrecked it."" My grandmother has used this language in the past referring to damage done in black areas during civil unrest. ""The people who lived here hated it so much that they had burned down a lot of it a month before.""... what did they hate exactly? I'm sort of confused as to why it is included. What is the purpose? And does it reflect back on society as a whole? Do we hate what we are, or what others are, so much that we are willing to destroy everything for a chance at change? Isn't that what war is: scorching the Earth with hopes of rebirth? 

* Finally, ""I was there. So was my old war buddy, Bernard V. O'Hare."" WHAT?? I thought Billy Pilgrim was the narrator. Are we learning he isn't? Are they about to meet? Am I just really confused? 

Looking forward to finding out what comes next! What about you? Tell me your thoughts. "

bookclub,"Norwegian Wood was the first Haruki Murakami book that I read and he instantly became my favorite novelist. I decided to make a video on the main theme of the book IMO, grief. I got so into it that I decided to make two videos. Here's part one. Hope you enjoy:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo-8uN6psTo"
bookclub,"Well, a lot happens here, so l et's get right into it. 

We get to meet Billy and get a few snapshots of his life. 

* And then we learn about the Tralfamadorians. That part blew my mind. I had no idea this was going to have aliens or time travel. Does that make this a sci-fi book? 

 * So all of this comes out due to letters Billy writes to his local newspaper, which infuriates his daughter and results in her threatening to lock him up where his mother is. I thought this was part of the generation where they took care of their elders? Given, she's only 21, but why doesn't she offer to move home with him (I do recognize she is married)? Or move him in with her? Why doesn't she get him a nurse instead of just a housekeeper? I'm not sure why her immediate solution is sending him to a home, but maybe I am just sensitive to this. What do you guys think?

* Moving on, one thing I noticed as Vonnegut described Pilgrim's family was the generations of war. He was born right after the first World War, which implies his father could have fought (though it does not exactly say this.) Of course, we know Pilgrim is in the Second World War. Then we learn his son fights in Vietnam. That is potentially 3 generations of war. It's become so commonplace that it is something to be proud of. I wonder what Mary thinks. The U.S. has been at war, literally, for 222 out of it's 239 years [(In contrast, Canada has been at war for 64/151 years)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_Canada). Do you think these perpetual wars with mostly invisible armies (since very little has been fought on U.S. soil) have affected what the U.S. has become?

* I found it interesting that wear was sort of ""unstuck"" in his own way right before the scouts left them. Remember, he's picturing this beautiful moment, he's part of the Three Musketeers, and has no idea he's bothering the scouts. What did you think? 

* ""How did I get so *old*?"" This quote hit me hard. My grandmother has asked me this question. I have asked myself this question, and I'm only 30. Will we all experience this? 

These are just my thoughts, ideas, and stuff I noticed. What about you? Favorite quotes, little moments you noticed, anything. "
bookclub,"Just finished Horns by Joe Hill, which I enjoyed a lot. I had some thoughts regarding the china figurines in the treehouse of the mind scenes, and I wonder what your take is.

In the scene, there are several china figurines - Mary, two angels, the devil, and the alien whispering in Mary's ear. I think these figurines actually correspond to the characters in the book:

One angel plays the horn and is mentioned looks like Terry.

Another angel looks aloof and holier than thou, somewhat like Ig is before Mary breaks up with him. 

Mary is, of course, Merrin. Ig even calls her that when burning the place down.

The devil figurine is, I think, simply the Devil. Ig replaces the aloof angel (or his metaphorical) head with the head of the devil, making the later connection between the two.

Which leaves the question who is the alien. I tend to think the alien is Lee, who after his incident in the corn field was left somewhat less human, without compassion and human connection.

What do you think? Does that make sense? Is it actually obvious to everyone? Is it wrong?"

### 1. Initial, no-pressure read-through

### 2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem

Now, it might be because I've listened to Rachmaninoff's ""The Bells"" several times, but even in English (not that I know Russian) the whole poem has a certain sing-songy quality to it. I think part of it is because of the repetition of words like Bell, but it also has high and lows and with the constant use of the exclamation mark it screams to me of it being sung. 

Together with that I feel like there's some sort of urgency when reading it, it's almost like I need to rush to keep up with the poem. Just like last week's poem was slow and deliberate, I felt this one was speeding up over and over and sometimes stopping, and starting all over again.

### 3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.

### 4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?

I don't think there's a story per se, but it is a way to show how many different and contrastive feelings and concepts one thing may mean and give.

### 5. What do you think the poem is about?

Apart from what I already said I think not so much, maybe it's also about the importance of sound in life? I don't know just trying to grasp at straws here haah.

### 6. Favorite verses

Honestly the third stanza is the best for me haha:

&gt; They can only shriek, shriek,  
&gt;                   Out of tune,  
&gt; In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,  
&gt; In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire,  
&gt;             Leaping higher, higher, higher, 
&gt;             With a desperate desire,  
&gt;          And a resolute endeavor  
&gt;          Now--now to sit or never,  
&gt;        By the side of the pale-faced moon.   
&gt;             Oh, the bells, bells, bells!  
&gt;             What a tale their terror tells  
&gt;                   Of Despair!  

It's almost Lovecraftian I feel

That's it for this week!"
bookclub,"Hello and welcome to our first chapter discussion for Norwegian Wood! You can find [the month’s schedule here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/8fv450/norwegian_wood_schedule_may_2018_selection/) or in the sidebar.

Let’s talk about the first two chapters! How do you like the book so far? What are your first impressions of the story, writing style, and the characters? I’ve picked 3 topics for today, but feel free to discuss whatever you’d like!

**Toru and Naoko**

What do you make of Toru and Naoko? I was struck by how ambivalent Toru seems to be about the life he’s living. He acts as if nothing matters - he doesn’t care where he lives, what his roommate does, or what he studies in university - and yet this carefree life doesn’t seem to be satisfying or rewarding at all. He doesn’t seem happy. At the end of chapter 2 we learn a bit about how this perspective may have been shaped by Kizuki’s death at 17:

&gt; There was only one thing for me to do when I started my new life in the dorm: stop taking everything so seriously, establish a proper distance between myself and everything else.

What are your thoughts? Is Toru passive by nature or is he shaped by the tragedies that surround him? 

My first impression of Naoko is that she seems to feel perpetually misunderstood. Twice we see her voicing a feeling to Toru (when she describes her depression in ch.1 and Toru says her problems won’t last forever, and when she describes searching for the right words in ch.2), only to say that he has completely missed the point. I’m not sure what to make of it yet, but I feel like this may foreshadow what’s to come for her. What do you think? Was there anything else that stood out to you?

**Memory**

The idea of memory and loss comes up pretty instantly, with Toru, now 37, reflecting about his past on his flight to Germany in chapter 1. 

&gt; ''What if I've forgotten the most important thing? What if somewhere inside me there is a dark limbo where all the truly important memories are heaped and slowly turning into mud?'' 

This adds a sort of intensity to the book – we can see that his self-reflection is not just passing nostalgia, but an attempt to preserve a very painful and significant time. Toru’s recollection of the walk in the woods also makes it clear that memory is a reconstruction, not a foolproof record of how things happened – he remembers things that weren’t really there (the well), and by the same token, may be omitting equally important things to the reader.

**The song**

I thought it would be interesting to take a closer look at the song that inspired the book’s title. If you haven’t already, you can listen to The Beatles’ [Norwegian Wood]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXJmg1LtajY) from the *Rubber Soul* album here! There’s some background information on the [Wikipedia page]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Wood_(This_Bird_Has_Flown\)) as well.

To me, the song seems to parallel the plot of the novel – the lyrics are about a man who has an affair with a woman who doesn’t return his feelings. At the end of chapter 1, Toru admits that he knew Naoko never loved him. 

How do you think the song relates to the novel?

That’s all I have for now! Hope you’re all enjoying your weekends!

bookclub,"Hey everyone. As [scheduled here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/8g9mcx/slaughterhousefive_schedule/), this is the first post re: *Slaughterhouse-Five* by Kurt Vonnegut. 

I am really sad that I don't have a hard copy of this book because there have been a lot of fantastic quotes already, things I would love to highlight and tab and return to time and again. I'd like to spend some time talking about those quotes, and the quotes from other works that Vonnegut uses. 

&gt; ""*Eheu fugaces labuntur anni*"" - Alas, the fleeting years glide swiftly by. 

I love this quote. I think it is beautiful. In context though, I wonder why it is used there. Immediately after, he pulls out ""My name is Yon Yonson."" Maybe it is paying respect to all of the time that has passed since the war, since Dresden. What do you think? 

&gt; ""mustard gas and roses"". 

First off, I thought mustard gas was invented in the '60's, so I learned something. I like the contrast here. I am finding I really appreciate Vonnegut's language. The clipped sentences are jarring, but in a way that I feel like I know the narrator. I love how he weaves the clipped sentences with longer, more descriptive language. 

&gt; ""Another thing they taught was that nobody was ridiculous or bad or disgusting."" 
 
This is counter to so much of what I've been taught, and what I've experienced. What about you? How do you deal with this information? 

&gt; ""World War Two had certainly made everybody very tough."" 

This is interesting to me. I wonder if the war really did make people tougher. Times were hard, certainly. Survival was never guaranteed. I wonder if the people of Europe and Asia, where the war was fought, were/are tougher than the Americans. 

&gt; ""'I tell you what,' I said, 'I'll call it ""The Children's Crusade.""' 

&gt; She was my friend after that.""

Aren't all wars just the crusades of children? Isn't it sending our youngest, strongest people to slaughter another group of young, strong people? Now, taking it to another level, are the leaders of wars just children as well? 

Now, my brain is fresh with *Catch-22* by Joseph Heller, but so many of the leaders in that book were focused on childish ideals instead of general human advancement or prosperity as a whole. They wanted a promotion, or they were angry and wanted to take that anger out on those around them. They acted out of fear or confusion. Perhaps, in addition to a reference to the actual Children's Crusade, and the fact that war is waged by children, it is calling leaders who have to solve their disputes with war childish? What do you think? 

&gt; ""It is so short and jumbled and jangled, Sam, because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre."" 

This is beautiful and I love it. 

&gt; ""This one is a failure, and it had to be, since it was written by a pillar of salt."" 

Because he looks back... get it? Beautiful. I love this line. 

I'm looking forward to hearing from you all. "
bookclub,"Hey, guys. 

I'm sorry I'm 2 days behind the schedule, but I finally finished and I figured we could go ahead and have our chat. **If you have not finished the book yet, feel free to come back later, or make a post when you finish, even if that is weeks or months from now. I will be paying attention. :-)**

So, what do you think of that ending? I mean, he's heading to Sweden? Do you think it was a good place to stop? Why do you think Heller ended the book there?

Do you think there is meaning in it being Nately's girlfriend that is constantly trying to kill Yossarian in the end? 

Heller's treatment of women throughout this book was incredibly troubling. Even the women he labeled as competent and respectable were harassed and abused. Do you think this was just a sign of the times, or is it something more? 

What was your least favorite part of the novel? What was your favorite part? Who was your favorite character? Least favorite?

I'm looking forward to hearing what all of you have to say."

I'm not sure a book has ever had this much of an impact on me, and though I tend not to reread, I anticipate revisiting this one frequently. Most of us seemed to get a lot out of it, and I suspect it's one of those books where you can read it over and over again and find something new every time. It's a shame, I think, that it's mostly famous for being long and not so much for being *good*.

So. Since this is our last (scheduled) post, talk to me. Even if you're a lurker. Even if you just post a little comment saying, ""I read it,"" or ""I'm almost done,"" or ""I fell so far behind I might be done by December,"" or ""I gave up."" I won't judge you! It'd be neat to have a count of who's been following along all this time.

What was your favorite or least favorite part of the book? The part you thought was most artful? The part that made you fall asleep?

Which characters did you love and hate, and did any of your beloved characters become your most hated, and vice versa?

If you're a writer or a storyteller of some sort, has it had an impact on your writing? Inspired you?

Have you learned about the history of the Russian Campaign of 1812? Did you do any extracurricular reading to make sense of it? (If so, and if you read the second part of the epilogue, did Tolstoy's viewpoint make sense to you?)

Last, and importantly, do you feel like a total badass for finishing it? Because you are.

We're going to take a break from Big Reads for a month, but we'll be voting on another one in a little more than a week. In the meantime, please remember that you can always, always post about this book here -- I know not a lot of people do, it's a bit more of an effort than making a comment, what if someone downvotes your post, etc., but it's always seen and appreciated by myself and the other mods, and I think the rest of the sub. We're here because we want to discuss good literature, and just because we're closing the book on scheduled *War and Peace* posts, that doesn't mean we have to, you know, close the *literal* book. I'll look for your posts in the short-term, and hope I get comments on mine when I reread this thing in a couple years."
bookclub,"Hey everyone!

So first of course, I will apologize about the lack of Poem of the Week last week, completely my fault.

But let's get to it, we are going to read ""Meditation on a Grapefruit"" by Craig Arnold

[How to read a poem by /u/surf_wax](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/7h6o9s/poem_of_the_week_the_love_song_of_j_alfred/) 

### [Here's the poem](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/52980/meditation-on-a-grapefruit)

And the main points:

1. Initial, no-pressure read-through
2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem
3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.
4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?
5. What do you think the poem is about?
6. Favorite verses

### 1. Initial, no-pressure read-through

### 2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem

So I gotta say that at first this poem reminded me of Sylvia Plath's ""Cut"" for some reason. After re-reading the poem I think I finally see why my mind connected the two: there's some odd sensual vibe to both of them, our of something that is generally not sensual.

With this particular one, the way it is written and the structure of it makes it seem like a ritual of some sort (not to mention the words ""discipline"" and ""devout""), something quite methodical and slow and careful and sensual. But it also seems to be about more than the simple act of peeling a grapefruit, and this is hinted at in the first three verses and the last two.

### 3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.

As always.. I have no idea haha. But there is something worth mentioning, I think. That the indentations or spaces seem to be quite deliberate, even make one verse into two and I wonder why not just make it another verse altogether. Thoughts?

&gt;like cotton padding        a cloud of oil

### 4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?

### 5. What do you think the poem is about?

Honestly... I'm not sure yet, I think it's something I need to mull over for a bit and re read the poem. I could understand the whole poem being about rituals of our every-day living that make the whole living bearable and possible, maybe appreciating those little moments of calm and ""meditation"" as it were, but those last two lines make me entirely doubt my reading. Within and without what?

### 6. Favorite verses

I think the whole last part is lovely

&gt;a pause     a little emptiness

Like a gathering of strength to go through the agitations of the day.

bookclub,"Hey, all! We're very close to being done with *War and Peace*, and are going to be starting a new Big Read, taking place from June through August.

It's still only April, but I mention it now because voting starts in a couple of weeks. If you have a long (&gt;450 pages) book you want us to do, please keep it in your back pocket, and for the rest of you, keep an eye out for qualifying novels you might want to read. Stuff that would work (and that I'll definitely be nominating): 2666, Mason &amp; Dixon, Infinite Jest, A Suitable Boy, Middlemarch.

I'll post a voting thread on May 8th, and we'll conclude voting on the 15th. See you then."
bookclub,"Voting has closed and the books we will be reading in May are *Slaughterhouse-Five* by Kurt Vonnegut and *Norweigen Wood* by Haruki Murakami!

If your selection was not chosen this time, please consider adding it to the Accumulator for more visibility in the future. 

Moving forward, as always, we are accepting volunteers for read-runners. If you'd like to manage either of these reads, please message the moderators. 

Schedules will be produced soon and we should start on or around May 1. "
bookclub,"Well -- I don't really have a lot for this one. This covers the second half of the first part of the epilogue.

A couple questions, though. I got some interesting reactions to the last discussion: namely, a couple contrasting viewpoints on the Rostovs' and the Bezukhovs' marriages. So what's your argument? Do you think either of the couples is happy? Does Natasha come into herself as a non-society woman who is sensible AF, or does her immediate dowdiness and her deferment to Pierre keep her from being happy? Do the Rostovs work on their marriage and find happiness or do they bicker? On a more meta level, does Tolstoy concern himself with the women's happiness?

Did you read the second part of the epilogue? Are you going to?

We'll wrap up on Saturday with discussion of the rest of the second part of the epilogue, plus an overarching discussion of the book as a whole. I'm also hoping to get a headcount of people who made it all the way. We're so close!"
bookclub,"I'm sorry guys, I'm being really unreliable this month. Got some personal stuff going on, but everything is fine. 

What's your feedback on the book so far? 

I read that the characters are all based on Heller's friends from when he fought in WWII. I can only imagine these people. What do you think? Could you love with even a dumbed down Aarfy? "
bookclub,"Hey guys. Sorry for the delay. Camp NaNo is taking it out of me. 

* What did you think of Milo selling out? Does this justify Yossarian's earlier paranoia at all? 

* The Chaplain had a rough time here. How do you feel about him? Is he annoying? Or just doing his best? 

* It seems like Yossarian gets pretty close to being discharged this time, only to have it pulled away. This really bothered me. What affected you? "
bookclub,"Well, thank goodness for this epilogue, right? Part 4 ends almost like *Gone with the Wind*, open-ended but hopeful, but Tolstoy clears up a lot of the questions we might still have about who winds up where.

Natasha and Pierre marry, and are happy together; Natasha becomes sensible and down to earth. Rostov, predictably, continues to have money management problems but overcomes them -- but he and Marya don't seem half as happy. Poor Sonya festers as a spinster and no one seems to like her (ugh).

I can't think of a whole lot to say about the epilogue. Do you find it interesting? Do people wind up where you thought they would? (I'm surprised at Tolstoy's poor treatment of Sonya -- he was sympathetic before, and he doesn't really try to get into her head here.) Talk to me!

**A note on Wednesday's reading:** The first part of the epilogue is story. The second part is Tolstoy's philosophical and historical musings on the war. I point this out because I was disappointed to discover that I'd run out of story before I thought I had.

Full disclosure, I didn't read the second part of the epilogue and I don't intend to. That doesn't mean you can't! I'll still post a discussion thread on the 28th, and we'll also wrap up the book with any overarching discussion you want to have then."
bookclub,"Guys, I'm so sorry. Life has gotten away from me and I forgot to post, though I kept meaning to throughout the day. 

So, let's keep it simple again. What do you think so far? What common themes stand out to you? 

What do you think about the increasing furor of insanity and paranoia?"
bookclub,"Back to Pierre now. In this section, I noticed some parallels with the beginning of the book. Years earlier, Pierre suffers a tragedy and comes into a fortune and a wife. I can’t find it (I guess that’s the trouble with such a long book), but it’s made clear to us that he has no idea what to do with his riches, and he doesn’t seem to notice or care that people are suddenly his friends and value his opinions because he has money. He lets himself be talked into a really bad marriage.

This time, he *also* suffers a tragedy, and *also* comes into a fortune (and, I think, he’ll acquire a second wife). But notice the difference! Instead of being lost and bewildered, Pierre is happy. Wildly happy. He’s self-confident; the esteem in which people hold him is genuine because he’s had a truly remarkable experience in the war. They even embellish his stories and say that Napoleon was there. He confides in Natasha and Marya like he confided in Vassily, but his confidence is respected, as is he. He’s the one in control.

Once we got past Kutuzov (who I hadn’t realized until now was real, whoops), I was absorbed. Pierre’s happiness is a pleasure to read about. (Although Tolstoy ruined the end of it for me with his misogynistic “*intelligent* women aren’t *real* women” crap.) I think Pierre and Natasha are going to get their happy ending.

Thoughts on this part? Do you think it’s a good match? Why do you think Natasha starts to cry and then dismisses Pierre?"
bookclub,"Good evening! Here is our new voting thread for May poetry.

There are four Saturdays in May, so we will take the four poems with the highest number of votes.

Please, nominate several poems, including any that didn't get selected last time that you still want to see us do! One poem per comment so voting is easy, just like we do for novels. The only requirement is that the poem is freely available online (please provide a link), wasn’t written by you or your best friend, and isn’t super long — let’s use Christina Rosetti’s “Goblin Market” as a benchmark and keep it to ~575 lines or below for now. Aside from that, anything goes: any period, any poet, free verse or structured.

Voting will close on the evening of 4/24. Happy voting!"

In short, the narrator of the poem has felt lonely since childhood and continues to feel alone: ""The mystery which binds me still."" Why might the narrator feel this way? Perhaps because his/her feelings come from a source different from where others' stem:

&gt; I have not seen  
&gt; As others saw—I could not bring  
&gt; My passions from a common spring—  
&gt; From the same source I have not taken  
&gt; My sorrow—I could not awaken  
&gt; My heart to joy at the same tone  
  
The ending is a depressing one—the narrator believes he/she will continue to see demons instead of feeling less lonely: ""(When the rest of Heaven was blue) / Of a demon in my view—.""  
  
A little historical context for his poem:

&gt; “Alone” is a 22-line poem, originally written in 1829 and left untitled and unpublished during his lifetime. The original manuscript was signed “E. A. Poe” and dated March 17, 1829. In February of that year, Poe’s foster mother Francis Allan had died. In September 1875, the poem, which had been in the possession of a family in Baltimore, was published with its title in Scribner’s Monthly. The editor, E. L. Didier, also reproduced a facsimile of the manuscript, though he admitted he added the date himself. The poem is now often included in anthologies.
&gt; 
&gt; “Alone” is often interpreted as autobiographical, expressing the author’s feelings of isolation and inner torment. Poet Daniel Hoffman believed “Alone” was evidence that “Poe really was a haunted man.”

There is end-rhyme and meter—both of which are not too important in the meaning of poem itself. This one is a downer!"
bookclub,"Hey guys, 

We are about halfway through it! How are you doing? 

I'm just going to hit on a few aspects of the chapters, not even one per. I am really enjoying it! So, let's get right to it.

&gt; There were too many dangers for Yossarian to keep track of. There was Hitler, Mussolini and Tojo, for example, and they were all out to kill him. There was Lieutenant Scheisskopf with his fanaticism for parades and there was the bloated colonel with his big fat mustache and his fanaticism for retribution, and they wanted to kill him, too. There was Appleby, Havermeyer, Black and Korn. There was Nurse Cramer and Nurse Duckett, who he was almost certain wanted him dead, and there was the Texan and the C.I.D. man, about whom he had no doubt. There were bartenders, bricklayers and bus conductors all over the world who wanted him dead, landlords and tenants, traitors and patriots, lynchers, leeches and lackeys, and they were all out to bump him off. That was the secret Snowden had spilled to him on the mission to Avignon —they were out to get him; and Snowden had spilled it all over the back of the plane.

&gt; There were lymph glands that might do him in. There were kidneys, nerve sheaths and corpuscles. There were tumors of the brain. There was Hodgkin’s disease, leukemia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. There were fertile red meadows of epithelial tissue to catch and coddle a cancer cell. There were diseases of the skin, diseases of the bone, diseases of the lung, diseases of the stomach, diseases of the heart, blood and arteries. There were diseases of the head, diseases of the neck, diseases of the chest, diseases of the intestines, diseases of the crotch. There even were diseases of the feet. There were billions of conscientious body cells oxidating away day and night like dumb animals at their complicated job of keeping him alive and healthy, and every one was a potential traitor and foe. There were so many diseases that it took a truly diseased mind to even think about them as often as he and Hungry Joe did. 

I love this quote. I feel like it just captures the insanity of it all and Yossarian's paranoid brain. Amazing. 

&gt; ‘It’s not my business to save lives,’ Doc Daneeka retorted sullenly.

&gt; ‘What is your business?’ 

&gt; ‘I don’t know what my business is. All they ever told me was to uphold the ethics of my profession and never give testimony against another physician.

The irony here is strong. I love it. I think Doc Daneeka really came through in this section. 

&gt; ‘And don’t tell me God works in mysterious ways,’ Yossarian continued, hurtling on over her objection. ‘There’s nothing so mysterious about it. He’s not working at all. He’s playing. Or else He’s forgotten all about us. That’s the kind of God you people talk about—a country bumpkin, a clumsy, bungling, brainless, conceited, uncouth hayseed. Good God, how much reverence can you have for a Supreme Being who finds it necessary to include such phenomena as phlegm and tooth decay in His divine system of creation? What in the world was running through that warped, evil, scatological mind of His when He robbed old people of the power to control their bowel movements? Why in the world did He ever create pain?’

&gt; ‘Pain?’ Lieutenant Scheisskopf’s wife pounced upon the word victoriously. ‘Pain is a useful symptom. Pain is a warning to us of bodily dangers.’

&gt; ‘And who created the dangers?’ Yossarian demanded. He laughed caustically. ‘Oh, He was really being charitable to us when He gave us pain!

Beautiful. Right? 

Alright, those are my favorites. Tell me what you think or what you hate or what you love! "
bookclub,"Lest we think of Pierre’s captivity as too happy, Tolstoy hits us with a bunch of war horror in this installment. Executions! Child soldiers! Child soldiers dying! Starving regular soldiers! Heartbreak!

We barely meet Petya, Tolstoy does as good a job as he can endearing him to us (the concern he has for the French drummer boy! omg Petya &lt;3), and then boom, he’s dead. Who else had to go back all, “Wait, what?” and reread that part? And poor Natasha, losing Andrei and then, suddenly, having to be strong for her mother when Petya dies.

What do you think of Natasha and Marya’s continuing friendship? Now Marya can identify with Natasha doubly; they have both lost Andrei and they have both lost a brother.

I tried to pull some discussion questions from the internet, but inadvertently spoiled myself about something, so I’m going to stop there. Let’s end on a high note, though — participate with me! Do you have a tiny little observation? Some turn of phrase you loved? Do you want to discuss the symbolism of the dog in depth? Anything goes."
bookclub,"Wow! Today got away from me. It seems like that is happening on post days. &gt;.&lt; 

Okay, this time I want you to lead the conversation. You tell me what you thought about chapters. What stood out to you? What were your favorite quotes? 

I promise to come and comment on every post, so don't be shy. :) "
bookclub,"Well, things got interesting with Pierre, didn’t they? He’s been miserable AF for the entire book, and then we get hit with him being super chill and happy in his POW status. Tolstoy explains why:

“The satisfaction of his needs … now that he was deprived of them all, seemed perfect happiness to Pierre, … that he forgot that a superfluity of life’s comforts destroys all the happiness of the satisfaction of one’s needs….”

Which makes sense. It’s not *being comfortable* that gives us a sensory reward, it’s the transition from discomfort to comfort — all the things that Tolstoy lists here. Pierre has never experienced want, and like some kind of reverse Maslow’s hierarchy, he doesn’t actually get to experience any of those transitions until he’s been through some real hardships.

I wonder if it’s going to have a lasting effect. Will all his money make him miserable once he’s free? I also think it wouldn’t be surprising if, having found the secret to his own happiness, he was killed, so I’m a little worried about him, going into this next section.

What did you think of this section? Any thoughts on the parts I didn’t mention?"
bookclub,"Hi, guys. Sorry, I'm running a bit behind. Like before, I am going to bullet point some of my questions or favorite quotes of this section. I hope you respond either to my bullet points or with your own observations. =D

* ""In the morning he stepped from his tent looking haggard, fearful and guilt-ridden, an eaten shell of a human building rocking perilously on the brink of collapse."" What an AMAZING quote.

* ""Colonel Cathcart had courage and never hesitated to volunteer his men for any target available."" Ain't that always the way? It seems all too common that leaders volunteer others for inevitable death to accomplish their goals. What do you think about this? 

* If anyone can explain command structure, I'd appreciate it. I don't really understand who is in control of who... 

* They say Catch-22 is where you have to do everything your commanding officer says you have to do, but I thought it was when you would be insane if you flew willingly, had to ask to be proven insane, and if you asked you were proven sane and then had to fly... which is correct? 

* In ""McWatt"" we see Yossarian admit to not having a liver problem and taking the fruit and giving it away indiscriminately. Somehow this makes Milo trust him. This seems so counterintuitive to me. Why would you want to trust someone who blatantly admits faking to get a note? Maybe he wasn't faking? 

* ""But that was war. Just about all he could find in its favor was that it paid well and liberated children from the pernicious influence of their parents."" - I like this. A lot. 
 
* That court scene though... 

* I love that Yossarian spoke to Major Major, and damn, Major's life... just hell. I am looking forward to the next section!

Okay, what are your thoughts?"
bookclub,"Hey!

So this week we'll take a stab at ""The Envoy of Mr. Cogito"" by Zbigniew Herbert.

[How to read a poem by /u/surf_wax](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/7h6o9s/poem_of_the_week_the_love_song_of_j_alfred/) 

### [Here's the poem](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48501/the-envoy-of-mr-cogito)

And the main points:

1. Initial, no-pressure read-through
2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem
3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.
4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?
5. What do you think the poem is about?
6. Favorite verses

However, before getting into it I think we should talk a bit about the first thing it caught my attention: This poem is a translation.

I did not know we could propose translation of poems. 

As a bit of background I studied translation at university and I do read poetry in my native tongue so I know a little about the translation of poetry, but it's not at all a strong foundation.

I find the whole aspect of translation a flawed exercise from the start, specially if it's poetry. Even when it's a poem that has no special structure or meter and it doesn't rhyme, the subtleties that are lost or injected into a translation are generally, to me at least, too noticeable, and I'm of the camp of ""a translation should not read as such"" so the translator should be invisible. But it's just not possible.

As an example, I've read some of Pablo Neruda's poetry and tried talking about it with a English speaker, and even though Neruda's poetry has no overt structure attached to it all of the translations I found were not bad per se (although some really are), but just lacking on what I read in the original.

So when reading any translation of any poem of a language I do not understand (I'm particularly fond of Haiku) I assume out of the gate that it has lost some of the original nuances and has gained some just by the choosing and discarding of some words.

My personal viewpoint in this moment of my life is that there's not much to do, it's just a flawed experience, but it's still better than not reading certain poetry and literature.

What do you think?

---

Ok, so now onto the poem.

### 1\. Initial, no-pressure read-through

### 2\. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem

So apart from the aforementioned translation aspect, what catches my eye is the lack of punctuation, it makes it a bit hard to discern where the sentences finish of if they continue.

I think I'm missing some context about the poem since it seems is part of a bigger whole. But who do you think is the speaker of the poem? Is it Mr. Cogito speaking to himself or is someone speaking to him? 

The mood of the poem kind of reminds me of the night before the death of Jesus Christ when he prayed not to be killed, but accepted his fate at the same time.

&gt; they are there to say: no one will console you

### 3\. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.

It's free verse. Yes I know, I never add anything in this part.

### 4\. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?

I think it's the inner thoughts of Mr. Cogito himself 

### 5\. What do you think the poem is about?

My perception is that it's about Mr. Cogito who is sent to someplace as a messenger where they will kill him, and no matter what he has to do it. And he is trying to calm himself, trying to put the importance of the mission without elevating his ""sacrifice"" as something noteworthy because he does it (if that makes sense).

&gt;repeat: I was called—weren’t there better ones than I

### 6\. Favorite verses

&gt; and let your helpless Anger be like the sea  
whenever you hear the voice of the insulted and beaten  

What I like about it is that I have no idea what ""being like the sea"" could mean. The sea means very different things to different people and at different time. Is it a calm and peaceful sea? Is it an eternal sea? A furious and stormy sea?

&gt; and do not forgive truly it is not in your power   
to forgive in the name of those betrayed at dawn

That's it.

Cheers!"
bookclub,"To my disappointment, a lot of this section was background information on the war. It's not uninteresting, but it's *less* interesting than my favorite characters, and seeing the count of hours left in the book on my Kindle, it feels wasted. We have had so much Pierre and Andrei and Natasha and everyone else, but that's about to come to an end forever.

Andrei's section was the most interesting, in my opinion. What a strange death scene. I'm not sure what to make of it. With a 21st-century (lay) understanding of medicine, I can guess that Andrei died of sepsis, but Tolstoy seems to take pains to explain it in what must be 19th-century thoughts. *What* he thinks Andrei died of is never explained, other than he got better and then worse, and had a prolonged but, interestingly, not entirely sentimental decline. There was more than enough time for a puke-worthy romantic death scene, and a lot of authors at the time (and even now) would have milked that for all it was worth, but Tolstoy... doesn't. He takes a step back. Andrei kisses his son because he feels like it's expected of him. He's cool with dying. Even the women seem pretty resigned to it; their tears upon meeting dry up quickly.

And how about Marya? It's like she's a whole different, capable person now that her father's dead. Her brother is gone, now, too, so she's the head of the family. I hope she becomes a formidable matriarch now that there's no one to overshadow her. If she does marry Rostov, and I expect her to, I think she's going to be the person in charge in that relationship.

Thoughts? Feelings? Hopes? Dreams?"
bookclub,"Hello, all! 

We had a lot of interest in *Catch-22* by Joseph Heller, so I am hoping we have a good turn out here. 

So, I'm going into this story blind, which I seem to be doing a lot lately. These are questions or topics I had while reading. Feel free to address any bullet point I throw out there, or come up with your own! 

* Why does Yossarian call everybody crazy? Does this imply he himself is actually the insane one? Was that Heller's intention? 

* I love the conversation between Orr and Yossarian in Chapter 3 about the apples. I think it establishes Orr as a really light-hearted kind of guy who is adept at changing Yossarian's mood. 

* Is anyone else concerned with Yossarian wanting to murder people all the time? I mean... why... violent deaths too. 

* It seems Heller likes to use positive statements with negative evidence that seems to disqualify his positive statements. He does it fairly often. One example is when Yossarian is talking to Doc Daneeka. Any idea why he does this?

    &gt; Doc Daneeka was Yossarian’s friend and would do just about nothing in his power to help him.

* ""... There was no telling what people might find out once they felt free to ask whatever questions they wanted to."" may be my new favorite quote. Is there anything you have read that you love so far? 

* The end of Chapter 5, Chief White Halfoat, confused me. Does anyone have insight into that final scene? 

Looking forward to hearing from you all! "
bookclub,"Apologies for the brevity; it's been a looooong day, and I'm still preparing for tomorrow. It's 8pm PDT and I haven't quite finished; for most of the rest of you, it's either tomorrow or close enough to midnight that it might as well be, so I'll get this up now.

We meet our old favorites. Helene has died in probably the most darkly comical way she could. Any thoughts about that? Then we move on to Marya and Rostov, who have a budding romance despite Rostov's second thoughts (and a little to-do with Sonya that I don't fully understand). Any insights into what's going on with him?

Then Pierre... experiencing real strife for the first time in his life. How do you think he's dealing with it? Is it more of the same, or is war turning him into a Strong Independent Man?"

bookclub,"Hey!

So... surprise! We got 5 Saturdays on March, not 4 as we thought...

We decided to grab one of the poems of the last month to fill this Saturday. Let's get on with it.

[How to read a poem by /u/surf_wax](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/7h6o9s/poem_of_the_week_the_love_song_of_j_alfred/) 

### [Here's the poem](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44640/my-lost-youth)

And the main points:

1. Initial, no-pressure read-through
2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem
3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.
4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?
5. What do you think the poem is about?

The poem should be on the public domain, but I won't copy it in its entirety because it's kinda long.

### 1. Initial, no-pressure read-through

Despite what I just said, it's not terribly long, it might seem that way at first, but it's nowhere near some others we have read *cough*Goblin Market*cough*

### 2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem

So, of course, I think the first thing that jumps are the lines:

&gt;""A boy's will is the wind's will,   
&gt;And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts."" 

The obvious question is: what do these two lines mean to the speaker?

Also, what mood does the poem incite in you? To me it's like nostalgia and a bit of fear? Not sure if fear is the right word, but the repeating lines are continuously preceded by verbs like ""haunting"", ""throbs"", ""murmuring and whispering"", ""chill"", etc. It's something that he cannot escape would be my guess.

### 3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.

Apparently it's called [""Sprung Rhythm""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprung_rhythm), which is ""designed to imitate the rhythm of natural speech"".

### 4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?

So this poem is definitely autobiographical, and it's about his childhood in Portland. To me they seem images of his childhood (in fact, the stanza about a sea-fight is an actual [event that happened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_HMS_Boxer))

### 5. What do you think the poem is about?

So apart from what has been said already, I like the underlying juxtaposition between the dreams of a boy with adventure (which is my interpretation of many of the mentions of seas, and Hesperides and the sea) and the old man's nostalgia for the tranquility of his natal city.

And I'm adding a sixth!

### 6. Favorite verses

So I'm adding this section just to mention a few that really caught my attention, feel free to add yours!

&gt; And catch, in sudden gleams,   
&gt;The sheen of the far-surrounding seas,   
&gt;And islands that were the Hesperides   
&gt;      Of all my boyish dreams.    

Love the image of islands out of reach being a mythological garden.

&gt;And the dead captains, as they lay   
&gt;    In their graves, o'erlooking the tranquil bay,   
&gt;        Where they in battle died.   

And 

&gt; There are dreams that cannot die; 

---

So what do you think of the poem? And why do you think the Lapland song verses and its repetition is so important for the poem?"
bookclub,"Okay, you guys, we are about to enter the home stretch. If you’re on schedule, you should be about 75% of the way done, about to freefall into Volume IV and the conclusion of the book. If you’re not on schedule, you’re somewhere else, and that’s okay too. We’ve come a long way these past three months!

What are your hopes and dreams for the final section? Will Andrei die? Will Pierre finally find happiness and confidence? Will Natasha grow up?

Let’s talk about Pierre in this final section of Volume III. He’s got grand ideas that don’t mesh with what we know of him in reality. He thinks he’s going to assassinate Napoleon, but then he runs into a French officer, *saves his life*, wtf Pierre, and enters into an uneasy friendship with him that prevents (or gives him the excuse not to?) the act that he probably wasn’t going to perform in the first place. I’m thinking both, *f’ing Pierre*, and also *thank god*.

So he bumbles around the city, rescuing children and generally trying to do what’s right, which is probably one of the bravest things we’ve seen him do… a bit like the duel and his defense of Natasha, but in my opinion more mature and noble than either of those things. I’m proud AF.

The Rostovs look back from the little progress they’ve made out of Moscow to find the city burning behind them. Sonya tells Natasha about Andrei, and she reunites with him, finds forgiveness and sits at his bedside, maybe to watch him die. I’m not sure if this is maturity or not. She’s not running from the choices she’s made, but I wonder how much of that is for her and how much is for Andrei. If he’s actually dying, do you think it makes his death better?

We end on a bit of a cliffhanger, with Pierre arrested and Andrei’s fate uncertain.

What did you think of this section? Are you eager to start the next part? "
bookclub,"Whew, lots to discuss here. I read this over two nights, so hopefully I get the main points. This section was one of my favorites yet.

1. Except for the part where frickin’ Andrei can’t decide whether he’s alive or dead. What do you think about this part? Tolstoy is too good a writer to employ the same deceit twice, in my opinion, so I have high expectations… unless maybe this trick was new when he wrote the book, and it’s only after more than 150 years of repetition that it seems old and tired.

1. Does the evacuation of Moscow remind anyone of the burning of Atlanta from *Gone with the Wind*? I haven’t had time to compare, and it’s been close to ten years since I’ve read the book or watched the movie, but I got that same panicked, chaotic sense of destruction probably common to all cities under attack.

1. The lynching of Vereshchagin. Then the crowd did something that surprised me: “And only when the victim ceased to struggle and his cries were replaced by a drawn-out, rhythmic wheezing, did the crowd hurriedly begin moving around the prone, blood-stained body. Everyone went up, glanced at what had been done, and with horror, reproach, and astonishment, pressed back again. / 'Oh, Lord, the people are like beasts, how could he be alive!' was heard in the crowd.” The very crowd that beat him to death (he dies almost immediately after this). I think there’s a lot to talk about here—mob mentality, a quote from *Men in Black* about a person being smart but people being stupid, the idea of people unwilling to face what they’ve done as part of a group so they blame the group instead and conveniently forget they’re a part of it. This is another really excellent way in which Tolstoy puts himself forth as a great observer of human nature, and it’s almost parable-like in its execution (no pun intended).

1. Jumping back, the behavior of the Rostovs as they pack, and the joy which infects Natasha and some of the others as they jettison their worldly goods to help evacuate the wounded soldiers. Do you think they’ll regret it?

What did you think about this section?"
bookclub,"Hello! Sorry I didn't above last night like I said I would. There was a storm and we lost WiFi connection. :-(. 

So, the winner with 89 votes is *Catch 22* by Joseph Heller! 

Next we will be taking volunteers for read runner. As soon as we have a schedule, it will be posted as a thread and in the side bar. The read should begin April 1st. 

Looking forward to reading with you!"
bookclub,"Hey everyone!

So this post was supposed to come out yesterday and I have no excuse, I just simply forgot!

So let's get to it:

[How to read a poem by /u/surf_wax](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/7h6o9s/poem_of_the_week_the_love_song_of_j_alfred/) 

### [Here's the poem](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/53086/home-burial)

And the main points:

1. Initial, no-pressure read-through
2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem
3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.
4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?
5. What do you think the poem is about?

### 1. Initial, no-pressure read-through

It happens to me but since I started reading poetry aloud I cannot do it in silence now, it loses so much when it's only read by the mind and the sounds don't come out of our mouths. I'm sure I'm not the only one, right?

### 2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem

I have not read Frost too long nor too much, but the first thing that popped to me was the fact that there are two people talking in the poem, which is quite different from what I came to expect after reading ""To Earthward"" or ""Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"", etc. It's also expressly a story with almost straight-forward dialogue, unlike usual poetry.

It's also quite a sad poem, because not only does it deal with the death of a child but also how two people ""that love"" seem to be torn apart because of not understanding each other's feelings.

I really like the double meaning of the birch fence:

&gt;“Three foggy mornings and one rainy day  
&gt;Will rot the best birch fence a man can build.”

### 3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.

According to [shmoop](https://www.shmoop.com/home-burial/rhyme-form-meter.html) it's Blank verse, or ""unrhymed iambic pentameter""

### 4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?

Despite the fact that the majority of the poem is comprised of the dialogue, there's still quite a bit of descriptions that makes you understand where you are and makes the whole thing more vivid. It also follows the ""show, don't tell"" rule, where both of the people are quite distinct and you can read the emotions on their own dialogues, from the sometimes-calm-and-sometimes-agitated impotence he feels:

&gt;Don’t—don’t go.  
&gt;Don’t carry it to someone else this time.  
&gt;Tell me about it if it’s something human.  
&gt;Let me into your grief. I’m not so much  
&gt;Unlike other folks as your standing there  
&gt;Apart would make me out.

To what Amy feels, what to me feels like just raw pain and grief, and restlessness:

&gt;‘Not you! Oh, where’s my hat? Oh, I don’t need it!  
&gt;I must get out of here. I must get air.  
&gt;I don’t know rightly whether any man can.’  

### 5. What do you think the poem is about?

While I definitely think that it's about grief, to me it feels to be more about the consequences of grief, the different ways people deal with it and the rift it can create when there's such a difference in how two people deal with pain, and how much pain can blind us from the pain of the other.

But of course, what do you think?

What do you think of the husband? Is he actually trying to reach the wife? What do you make of the last line?

What do you think of Amy?

That's it for this week, sorry again for the delay.

Cheers!"
bookclub,"Thanks for bearing with me yesterday! I had an excellent time being a toursit, and you are getting a higher-quality post for your efforts today. Also, many thanks to /u/elphie93 and /u/jdtait for their top-level posts! You guys are great!

So, this section. Check out this Milgram-esque obedience to authority bit after the battle: 

&gt; At any moment all these men might become horrified at what they were doing, drop everything, and run away wherever their legs took them.

&gt; But though by the end of the battle the men felt all the horror of their actions, though they would have been glad to stop, some incomprehensible, mysterious power still went on governing them ….

While [Milgram’s study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment) has been [called into question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment#Validity), going along with the crowd is still a common enough experience that we experience real anguish in situations like this. I’d be surprised if anyone hasn’t been in the position of these soldiers, doing something they think they shouldn’t be doing or don’t want to do, just because everyone else is doing it too and they’re afraid of ridicule/summary execution.

The reaction to Helene’s remarriage is similar, I think. No one (except Marya Dmitrievna) really questions it; they just go along with it because some authority must have blessed it: “…and to doubt the correctness of the decision would mean to risk showing one’s stupidity and inability to live in society.”

How are things going at the Rostovs’? Did Pierre have the reaction you thought he would upon going home? Is Andrei really, *really* dead this time? Talk to me!"

bookclub,"Quick recap of these chapters: Yuri is still with the partisans when winter sets in. Conditions are grim, and a bunch of women and children show up (turns out women are incredible, capable of way more than the men are),and somehow they tough it out, thanks largely to steak and, not surprisingly, vodka. One poor nutcase kills his own family before scarpering off, which we probably all could have predicted, and so could Yuri, if his darned coke-addled bunkmate and (somehow) division leader hadn't kept him awake for days on end. Finally we get news that the White offensive has broken, at least in their area, and the Reds (whom we now know as Soviets) have turned the tide. We also learn that Yuri's family might be dead, or in mortal danger. So naturally, Yuri chooses that moment to escape (which it seems like he could have done whenever he wanted to) and flee to...Lara. After a long, brutal journey, he is finally reunited with her, but immediately comes down with something. She nurses him back to health, and many deep conversations ensue about love and culture and philosophy. We find out that Yuri's family is safe but has relocated to Moscow. Yuri, who is no doubt completely healthy by now, decides to stick around to continue his ""recovery"" for a few months. Eventually, he receives a letter from his poor, grieving wife, which is where chapter 13 ends. 

I would like to discuss a very important theme that really comes out in these chapters: Love. Both Yuri and Lara seem to love two different people equally, if differently. Yet some of their statements seem to contradict this, such as when Lara asserts that she would return to Pavel if he would return to how he once was, or Yuri's continual pining for Tonia and his family. So do you think that Yuri does love both Tonia and Lara, or does he feel something different? Do you think it is possible to love two people equally?"
bookclub,"Hi all, I was wondering how many of us are still left reading this giant book 3 months in.

Only a few people post in the threads, but I figured there will be others out there who have fallen behind, read ahead or simply have nothing to say! 

So who is still going? Which part are you up to? Are you determined to finish?"
bookclub,"...And it was totally avoidable, too! I am ditching you to scratch off an item on my California bucket list, since there's a non-zero chance I'll be moving out of state soon. Plus it's my birthday weekend. I planned to pre-write a post and put it up while I was out, but work got busy today and it's just not gonna happen.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to make a top-level post about this upcoming section tonight or tomorrow! I will still make a regular post on Sunday, but I'd love to check in while I'm taking a break tomorrow and see a bunch of W&amp;P discussion.

Is there anything you noticed about this upcoming section? Any patterns with the rest of the book? Are you worried about Andrei? Are you still back in Part 2 and want to talk about something that happened in there? Hit me!"
bookclub,"Whoa, okay, Andrei is kind of not being all that nice to Pierre right now. I know why he's snippy AF but damn. And Pierre just seems to kind of take Andrei's underhanded cruelty at face value, poor guy.

There are a couple notable sections here: Andrei's wartime ennui. Everything is pointless! People are just killing other people! War is terrible! He waxes philosophic on the nature of war in a way that I think is 100% Tolstoy making his own opinions known. What do you think of his opinion on the nature of war?

We look over Napoleon's shoulder for awhile and Tolstoy seems to want to make an argument about his cold here. Is the battle lost for want of a dry nose? He thinks not. Napoleon's too good for that, and the Russians are even better, to be able to defeat Napoleon at his best.

Then we have Pierre, bumbling around the battlefield on a horse he can't control and being the least important person, absurdly, in the most important place in the whole battle. (I loved this line: ""On the contrary, it seemed to Pierre that this place (precisely because he was there) was one of the most insignificant places of the battle."")

Then we see Andrei injured again, and badly. But he wants to live? Will he? TUNE IN NEXT TIME....

Thoughts? Feelings? Opinions?"
bookclub,"Hey guys. Sorry for the delayed post, some stuff came up. 

Let's keep this post easy. Just tell me your favorite part of the book so far. What strikes to your heart? What confuses you? What makes you angry? 

I'll try to respond to every comment. "
bookclub,"I loved it all, every part of it. Part 7 has brought me to a whole different level of immersion, as someone who wanted to commit suicide in a past, I could so much relate to Anna’s feelings, when she spends so much time thinking about her death, how it’d solve all her problems. But she realizes she’s still alive, there’s world around her, she bursts into tears. I had these exact feelings. Those are heavy thought to carry on your own, and she happened to be alone at the critical moment.  My relationship with Anna has morphed from ‘absolutely love her’ to ‘frustratingly disappointed’ to being very compassionate to her. 
Every character in the book is fantastic, no one is perfect, yet still very likable.

bookclub,"Tolstoy has a lot more to say about mortality this time than any other so far. The section opens with Pierre (I think, I am under a cat right now and the book is way over there) being a bit in denial about leaving Moscow and getting the news from Julie, who subsequently flees while he sits around twiddling his thumbs, in apparent disbelief that it's ever going to happen to Moscow/him.

He's finally prompted to act and on the trip he sees troops, some of whom are doomed to die, acting completely normal, and it blows his mind a little bit. Why, he wonders, are they not preoccupied with their own impending deaths? He's pretty sure he would be.

We cut to Andrei, who's in despair and feels contemptuous of Marya calling their father's death a ""trial"", because he wonders for who? Dad is dead, it's not a trial for him, surely. (Interesting how Andrei thinks of this from the point of view of his father, and Marya thinks of it from her own point of view. Do you think that has something to do with their different relationships with the old prince, and how capable either of them was of relating to him?) He is pretty sure he's going to die the following day, though I can't see that he has much justification for it -- maybe it's because he's preoccupied with death in a way he wasn't when his wife died. (Does his misogyny make him incapable of internalizing death when it happens to a woman, when it's all-consuming when it happens to a man?)

And then, not so much death-related, Pierre's acknowledgement that he doesn't understand military maneuvers and yet his belief that the right thing is being done by sending the soldiers to the top of the hill... I'm sure it's significant in the literary sense, but I wanted to point it out because I think it's another example of somewhere every single one of us has been in one area or another.

What did you think of this section? It feels very preparatory -- I'm eager to see what happens during the battle."
bookclub,"Hey everyone!

So this week we'll talk about a poem I had never read. Sadly, I'm also kinda sick so my comprehension skills are sub par, and this poem is absolutely eluding me.

But first, the usual links!

[How to read a poem by /u/surf_wax](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/7h6o9s/poem_of_the_week_the_love_song_of_j_alfred/) 

### [Here's the poem](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45234/the-emperor-of-ice-cream)

And the main points:

1. Initial, no-pressure read-through
2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem
3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.
4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?
5. What do you think the poem is about?

### 1. Initial, no-pressure read-through

### 2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem

The first thing that caught my eye was the words used. I've found that my non-nativeness does make reading some poems a bit hard, but this was a real challenge I'm still not sure I've got a hold on. 

Because one thing is to use words like ""wench"" or ""concupiscent"" but what would ""deal"" mean ""Cheap pine or fir wood"". And what does the stanza:

&gt;Let be be finale of seem.

even mean? I just can't get my head around it.

### 3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.

### 4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?

Now, thankfully, there's this [""poem guide""](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/articles/70138/wallace-stevens-the-emperor-of-ice-cream) which makes sense of the whole poem (and also makes my self-esteem go back to its original level)

&gt; If you’re confused by now, you’re not alone: celebrated critic Helen Vendler noted that the poem, despite its fame, “resisted explication for some decades.” 

### 5. What do you think the poem is about?

My recommendation is that you try to make sense of the poem before reading the poem guide, but not feel bad if you need to read it to understand a bit more of it. It seems that the poem is really obscure in its entirety.

I'm really sorry about the lack of quality of this week's poetry discussion, my head throbs and I can't make a ton of sense of it. But I hope there's some good discussion about it!

bookclub,"Welcome back!

Chapters 7&amp;8 certainly felt pretty slow to me. Lots of transportation, and let me tell you, riding on a crowded train in Russia is not fun even in the 21st century. 

***
**Background information:**

One thing I want to point out is the relative chaos that is the backdrop to these chapters. As we see in these chapters, there is still a front-line presence against the German-Austrian forces, plus the Bolsheviks (whom we now know as the Soviets), but also Mensheviks (the Whites), and the Greens. There were many factions and governing authorities at this time because, with the fall of the imperial government, communities (soviets) started establishing their own local governing bodies. This breakdown of governance is why you see the emphasis on bartering materials, the lack of organization and leadership, and the confusion from region to region on who is fighting whom, and who is in control, etc. 

Since I haven't mentioned it before, now seems a good time to briefly discuss Russian naming conventions. Firstly, Russians are formally referred to using their first name and their ""patronymic,"" a name derived from their father's first name. For males, it is usually constructed by adding ""-ovich"" to the end of the name, while for females it's ""-ovna."" These patterns change depending on spelling, but that's the general rule. That's why Yuri is Yuri Andreievich, and Tonia is Tonia Alexandrovna, but her father is Alexander Alexandrovich. Of course, they still have their family names (Zhivago, Gromeko, Komarovsky, Antipov, Strelnikov) which are sometimes used to refer to them. It can get confusing, which is why I recommend having a name list with the different names when you read. However, it is also interesting to know this, because while Yuri's father may have been well known--as ""Zhivago,"" Yuri would likely be introducing himself as Yuri Andreievich, and the Zhivago name would only be revealed later. Russians also make liberal use of ""diminutives"" in their names. These are typically ""-ochka"" or ""-enka"" replacing a vowel at the end of a name, or just ""-ka"" if the name ends in a consonant. The key is to look for the root of the name. Finally, Russians also use a lot of nicknames in addition to and together with diminutives. Yuri (Юрий) becomes Yura (Юра), which is shorter in Russian, Antonia becomes Tonia, Pavel becomes Pasha, and Alexander becomes Sasha. As you can see, these are not always shorter than the originals, and, in the case of Alexander--Sasha don't necessarily look like each other. And then you add diminutives, so you get Pashenka or Sashenka, and at that point you really do just need a reference document.

***

**Discussion:**

While there wasn't a lot of action, per se, I love these chapters because they really capture the day-to-day life and chaos of Russia during this time period, as well as really pointing to some key fundamentals of Russian identity. The way Tonia handles packing the belongings and asking friends to watch their apartment to how the family handles the entire train ride and the ups and downs it entails hits on the humility, tenacity, pragmatism, and just all-around salt-of-the-earth-iness of the Russian people. The vignette about Vasia, the wrongfully imprisoned boy, and Private Voroniuk who was responsible for the number of his charges ""with his life"" highlights some of the darker elements of Soviet life and rule. There developed an intense self-preservation instinct at any cost, while at the same time the demands of the government coupled with extremely severe consequences encouraged fraud and dereliction. 

We also meet Strelnikov in these chapters, who...let's just say his character interests me. It's heavily implied that he is the presumed-deceased Pasha Antipov, as well. At a minimum, he seems smart, capable, reasonable, and passionate.

Two of my favorite parts of these chapters were the Mikulitsyns and Anfim Efimovich. The Mikulitsyns because their reaction to the Zhivago's arrival, blunt and unpolished as it was, reveals the basic realization of most families during this time period: *We can't help you, we need all we have to survive ourselves.* Ironically, they seem to be doing all right, but that seems to be irrelevant. Efimovich, on the other hand, is a staunchly idealistic Marxist...whom, it turns out, is a central player in the black market. Again, the irony gets me, but also the reflection of Russian society: it viewed the revolution as inevitable and necessary and inescapable, as is mentioned several times, but who really bought into it? From the beginning, a small number of ideological purists fought for it, while most people actively worked to undermine it to preserve their own wealth and well-being.

I think my absolute favorite part of this section happens on the train, in Ch 7 S 18: ""All these days he lay in his bunk and slept and woke and thought and listened. But there was nothing yet to hear,"" followed in the next section by the rushing of spring and all the sounds that come with it. The translation doesn't really capture the depth of meaning here, as, for example, he was listening *carefully*, or *paying attention* to something, and the ""thinking"" is more along the lines of pondering or meditation.

***

**Your Turn**

Sorry for the walls of text. What are you thinking? How is the pacing and the character development in your opinion? Do you think Strelnikov is actually Pasha, or is it just a story someone made up? What was your impression of the entire journey to Varykino? What parallels or allusions did I miss here? What other questions do you have?"
bookclub,"I've had a hella long day, you guys, and I am about to head off to bed. I didn't want to disappear without putting up a post, though! And I expect to be in better form on Saturday.

We had a lot happen in this section: the older Prince Bolkonsky's death, Marya's ""wickedness"", the short-lived siege of the muzhiks, Rostov's rescue, Andrei's meeting with Denisov.

What do you think is in store for Marya now that her main tormentor is dead? Is she going to be on the lookout for a new one? What did you think of Andrei's reaction to Denisov? What about the old prince's last words?"
bookclub,"A lot happened in these two chapters, so let's do a quick recap. 

We have the war on the front lines ending and Yurii and Lara heading home. Yurii wants to ensure Lara does not think he's in love with her, but she squashes that pretty squarely before leaving the town. We see a death and then Yurii leaves as well 

In Chapter 6 the Zhivago family goes through a tough time, and it's unclear if they are going to survive until they head back to Urals. 

So that's a very quick and dirty recap. Tell me what you think of the book so far. Who is your favorite character? Any predictions? 

I know I came into the story knowing nothing, and I find myself looking up Russian history to see what is happening. If anyone has an understanding of the time frame this was occurring, please, share your insights! 

Looking forward to hearing from you! "
bookclub,"Hey everyone!

So this week we are going to be talking about a favorite poem of mine, ""To Earthward"" by Robert Frost.

[Here's the usual link](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/7h6o9s/poem_of_the_week_the_love_song_of_j_alfred/) about how to read a poem by /u/surf_wax 

[Here's the poem](https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/earthward), (note that it's a window that you can scroll downwards).

And the main points as always:

1. Initial, no-pressure read-through
2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem
3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.
4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?
5. What do you think the poem is about?

So let's get started!

### 1. Initial, no-pressure read-through

Since I've read it many times over I cannot remember what it was that I first thought about it, what I do remember is that every time I re-read it always shocks me how long it actually is, I always think is far shorter than the reality.

### 2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem

Does something jump at you? To me what has always jumped is the second stanza, not for a particularly especial reason, but because it seems to be to leave an idea undeveloped:

&gt;The flow of—was it musk

And I've never understood if that's just me and my lack of skill or it's just how Frost meant it.

I also really like that while the poem is neither about nature or flavor/taste, it's still quite interconnected to the point of making it impossible to remove either from the poem and making the poem make sense.

What is the mood? To me there's something very bittersweet about the poem, but in a good way, something melancholic, almost nostalgic but still not regretting how things currently are, just accepting the change.

### 3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.

I absolutely suck when it comes to meter so I'm going to refer to this [kellyrfineman.livejournal.com
](https://kellyrfineman.livejournal.com/361077.html) that says:

&gt;It is written using eight cross-rhymed stanzas: ABAB, CDCD, etc. The meter selected is iambic, which was pretty common for Frost. The first three lines of each stanza contain three iambic feet; the fourth contains only 2.

### 4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?

As you may have seen the poem is divided into two, the past and the present. It's in part telling a story, as I said earlier, it's, to me, explaining a feeling or a want through tastes an nature (very Frost to have a poem about nature). And yet, I don't think that ""telling a story"" is the right expression either. What do you think?

### 5. What do you think the poem is about?

I think it's about growing old/maturing and how that changes perspectives and what we want, either because we have changed perspectives or because we just can't appreciate the same things like we did before: 

&gt;I craved strong sweets, but those  
&gt;Seemed strong when I was young;

### Others:

* What do you think the title means/refers to?
* So what do you think about the second stanza? 
* Who is the speaker talking to?
* What do you think the author means when he says: ""The hurt is not enough:/I long for weight and strength/To feel the earth as rough/To all my length."" Could it be because he wants to die and be buried? (I read that in another part, and I'm not sure I agree)
* Do you think this poem only applies to love? Or would it apply to other aspects of life?
* Do you like the use of nature in the poem? 

Either way, I love the poem and would love to hear your thoughts!"
bookclub,"The war and the peace are coming closer together.

I loved this section a lot because Pierre was so relatable. Aside from his defense of Natasha, he's been more or less milquetoast the entire novel. Like before, he comes up here with an improper opinion about the war that he hasn't thought out very well or anticipated the reaction to, and he goes down in flames in front of an audience who won't let him talk once rebutted. He seems to realize that better this time, though, and he tries to fix it, to no avail.

I think this is something that's very difficult to do in a shorter book. We see character growth frequently -- it's more or less a hallmark of good literature -- but showing character growth in such small and realistic increments is something not a lot of novels have the luxury of doing because they're not 1200 pages long. I feel a bit like I'm watching a long TV series instead of a movie -- Tolstoy can just cram stuff in where otherwise he wouldn't have been able to.

Then we have Smolensk, which is threatened by Napoleon's approaching army, along with Bald Hills (Andrei's father's place). Prince Nikolai has a senior moment and doesn't really get the full import of the letter until later, much like Pierre's earlier failure to follow a communication to its conclusion. (Are there any more examples of this?) Then we see the townspeople fretting, and the innkeeper Ferapontov setting fire to his own grain stores to keep the French from getting to it. He starts this section out thinking that the idea of fleeing is ridiculous, he hits his wife for wanting to flee, and then he flips and just destroys everything when the pressure becomes great enough.

I found the whole thing unsettling. What did you notice about this section?"
bookclub,"There is a ton of stuff going on in these two chapters. In fact, there's more action and character development than some full-length novels. An engagement, death of a loved one, assassination attempt, two weddings, two children, a war, large sums of money changing hands, and, of course, the beginning of the revolution.

So how is the book coming along? How are you doing with names and locations and general historical knowledge? How does the pacing feel in these chapters compared to the first two? While it covers less time, it felt more rushed, like Pasternak was hopping from highlight to highlight in a few densely-packed years.

A few things I wanted to bring to your attention/point out: There is a lot of foreshadowing that I didn't pick up on the first time I read this (I'm a bit further along the novel already, but haven't finished it yet). Not only does Yuri begin crafting one of his first and most popular poems, there were also a number of references to aspects of the Revolution that will come up later on. Additionally, what do you think of the parallels between Yuri's and Lara's lives? In many ways they mirror one another, and in many ways they are opposite: Both get engaged/married, move, and have children, but Yuri's marriage is largely forced on him while Lara forces hers, Yuri's family and education elevate him to an upper class while Lara is allowed to participate in high society because of her affiliations, and the war affects each of them differently--Lara by pulling her husband away from her, and Yuri by forcing his family to flee.

So, what are your thoughts? What questions do you have? I, for one, am excited for the next couple of chapters and the promise of the Russian Revolution!"
bookclub,"I liked this section better than the last one -- it seemed to require less political and historical context to understand. I could lie back and enjoy it a little more.

We've got Rostov, who's being flirty with the doctor's wife in the war camp. Do you think that's because he misses Sonya or because he doesn't?

I thought his heroism was interesting. He doesn't know what he's doing, but everyone else treats him like he's actually a war hero. What do you think the ""unpleasant feeling which wrung his heart"" was? The entire thing reminds me of growing up and learning that adult competence is a big scam -- I think Rostov has breached the hero threshold, and he's still the same scared guy he was before, only now it's been made clear to him that the other heroes are also like him. Or maybe he feels like he's an imposter, and he's not actually equal to these other, clearly more competent war heroes. Thoughts?

Natasha briefly finds God, but manages to be less annoyingly pious than Marya. It passes like a teenage phase. Do you think it helps her out of her depression? What do you think of the doctor taking responsibility for her recovery?

And what's going on with the comet and Pierre's numerology? He has to do some serious contortions to get his number at 666, but wholeheartedly believes its truth when he does. How does this relate to Natasha's brief piety? Does it do the same thing for him that her thing does for her?

And last, Petya gets caught up in patriotism like his big brother Rostov did earlier. I expected him to die in the crowd scene, and now that he's survived, I expect him to die in the war, but maybe not. We've seen so little of him so far that he seems expendable.

What did you think of this section?"
bookclub,"Beforehand I should say that I'm still in chapter 5, so maybe I'm lacking information that appears later in the book.

I'm finding this book a bit hard to follow as I'm reading it in English and it's not my first language but, as I understand it, Zampanò dictated his words to some PhD candidate called Maud Fife-Harris according to the footnote on page 55. 

However, I remember that a few pages back, there was a ""could of"" in Zampanò's part. I specifically remember it because it surprised me, although I didn't think much of it then. I can't find the page where it appears, but I'm looking for it.

Of course, we can find that error a million times in Johnny's writings, but never in Zampanò's. Maybe it's because it's 2 am or because this book is making me completely paranoid, but I've been thinking that maybe Johnny messed with the text for some unknown reason. 

Also, it would really help me if someone could explain what exactly happened and page 40 that made Karen scream. A book falls from the shelf and ???

I'm aware that it's a very stupid question, but as I said I'm having some troubles following some parts of the story, although overall I'm enjoying it so far.
"
bookclub,"Alright, so we met a lot of characters in these first two chapters, and we watched a man die, a girl ""become a woman"", and a revolution begin. 

I went into this book with no knowledge of it, or what it is about.

So I want to know your first impressions. What do you think of the writing? The characters? What about the setting? I feel like we've traveled over most of Russia, though I'm sure I'm wrong.

I am struck by hearing of meeting Yurii's father only as he dies. I wonder if he knows his father is dead, and whether or not he has inherited any of his money. 

Alright, nothing off limits! "

bookclub,"Okay, let’s talk [“Rime of the Ancient Mariner”](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43997/the-rime-of-the-ancient-mariner-text-of-1834)!

“Rime” is a classic poem, pretty long, and it’s had a definite impact on pop culture. It’s where we get our albatross-as-unwanted-burden idiom, Iron Maiden made a 14-minute song out of it, Dr. Frankenstein quotes it in *Frankenstein*, the Coast Guard even has a crew designation of the Ancient Mariner aboard its ships.

This is my last Poem of the Week, and they can’t fire me anymore, so I’m going to do something a little different. “Rime” is definitely a poem, but it’s also a short story, and I think that while we’d benefit from several reads, few of us are actually going to do that. What I want to do is to treat this poem like a short story.

It opens with the Ancient Mariner lurching around someone’s wedding, and he accosts an innocent guest to start telling him this story. The guest tries to dismiss him, but I guess uninvited lunatics can be compelling sometimes, and he’s hooked.

The Mariner launches into this story about heading out on a ship. A storm happens and they flee south into the Antarctic and are mired in ice. After an undetermined length of time, an albatross appears, and with it, their salvation from the ice; the ice splits and they’re on their way. The albatross stays with them as they sail north. Eventually, the Mariner gets bored/drunk/possessed and shoots it with a crossbow.

Everyone is pissed at him. The albatross brought their wind, and now it’s dead, what the actual hell, Mariner. Because this is a poem, the wind dies and leaves them hanging out on the sea, unable to move. (At this point we get the phrase “Water, water everywhere / Nor any drop to drink,” which I hadn’t realized was from this poem.) They’re thirsty, they’re hungry, they’re beset with sea monsters and nightmares.

The crew hangs the albatross, whose body they have somehow saved, around the Mariner’s neck. After awhile, he sees a sail on the horizon. There’s no wind, and yet it’s coming toward them quickly. It seems to be a ghost ship, with a scary vampire woman at the helm and deaths (skeletons?) hanging around her. This is really not a good sign, and the crew of the Mariner’s ship give him dirty looks and then they *die*.

The wedding guest seems glad at this point that he wore his brown pants. But the Mariner assures him that he’s not a ghost. He’s alone on the ship now, it’s a bad moment. He can’t pray. He hangs out for seven days in complete agony and fear, with sea serpents as his only companions. He unconsciously blesses them because hey, look at all the neat colors, and that’s when his luck changes. He’s suddenly able to pray again, and symbolically, the albatross falls from around his neck into the sea.

He sleeps. When he wakes up, it’s rained and he has water to drink. A wind comes. The ship starts moving. And, uh, the dead crew rises. There are several references made to this happening in a dream, but it’s unclear to me whether this is actually part of his dream or not. The wedding guest interrupts again because he’s scared, but the Mariner tells him to shut up and keeps telling his story.

The corpses do a weird chorus as the sun rises, which seems to move the ship. After they stop, the ship moves kind of weirdly and the Mariner, in some kind of fit, hears a voice say to another voice that he’s done his penance for the crime of killing the albatross.

There follows a scientific discussion about what makes the ship move and navigate by itself, and then the voices are gone. When the Mariner wakes up, he’s struck by the eeriness of the corpses, which seem altogether different than they did earlier. But the mood changes abruptly: the ship moves on, he feels hopeful, his home harbor appears! But oh damn, he turns around and the deck is strewn with corpses again, and there’s an angel hovering over every one; evidently they were puppeteering the bodies. Creepy. But then real life comes for him; someone’s rowing out to meet him. It’s a Pilot (?) and a Hermit.

When they reach the ship, the ship straight up sinks. The Mariner falls in the water, but the people in the boat pull him out, thinking he’s dead. He moves, and they freak out. The Pilot’s son thinks he’s the devil. And the Mariner has never been the same; he’s cursed or something, and has to wander the land, telling his story to specific people to alleviate the pain in his heart. The wedding guest is delivered back to the joy of the wedding, but is a changed man.

…Dang, yo. I haven’t read this since my senior year of high school, and all I remembered was the lone Mariner and the albatross and major troubles on the sea. Like the wedding guest, I am actually kind of struck to find myself in my living room at the end of the story, drinking a soda and listening to the dishwasher. This is a powerful poem, and it’s a *masterful* one. Look at all the distinct moods. We have the joy and hope of a wedding and of setting sail; the boredom of getting stuck in the doldrums; the fear of being stuck in the ice; straight up *ghost ships*… damn.

Also, this thing is so full of symbolism that there’s barely room for words. Colors! Religion! Death! The albatross! Weather and astronomy! Look at all the religious imagery, this thing is like *Billy Budd* on steroids. The albatross is the burden of the cross, the angels appear, death and the devil have enormous parts. Prayer figures heavily into this thing. I’d actually like to talk about the symbolism, but because there’s *so much* of it, it’s hard to know where to start.

Coleridge uses a lot of language that’s evidently archaic for the time. I think I can pick some of it out, but this poem is 200 years old, and it’s a bit difficult for me to tell what’s old-old and what’s just old. I think “kirk” for “church” is not old-old, but who knows. A lot of it just looks like Scots.

A spot check tells me the poem is written in alternating iambic trimeter/tetrameter (every other syllable stressed, three/four stresses per line).

So. What did you notice about this poem? What did you like about it, what did you not like? What symbols were you able to pick out? What do you think the “moral” was, if there was one? How has it changed the wedding guest? What was the point of the hermit? Who’s suddenly a Coleridge fan?"
bookclub,"So... what did we think of this part? I was all ready to write a big long post about it, and then I actually read it, and I'm at kind of a loss. It was 90% military maneuvers and diplomacy, and while I'm often riveted, this time I wasn't, and I can't find much to say about it. I'm sorry!

Andrei, though! Did anyone feel like it was less about Natasha than about Anatole stealing something from him? A lot of you started out disliking him, and I am getting closer and closer to that point.

What did you like? What did you dislike?"
bookclub,"Hey everyone!

So as you may know I'm not an expert at all, so my posts will only work for kick starting the whole discussion and won't be too in-depth.

So first, the same as always: [here is a link to the first discussion where /u/surf_wax outlined how to read a poem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/7h6o9s/poem_of_the_week_the_love_song_of_j_alfred/) 

Second, here are the basics. Each number corresponds to a read-through of the poem:

1. Initial, no-pressure read-through
1. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem
1. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.
1. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?
1. What do you think the poem is about?

## And the poem: 

&gt;The last Night that She lived  
It was a Common Night  
Except the Dying—this to Us  
Made Nature different  

&gt;We noticed smallest things—  
Things overlooked before  
By this great light upon our Minds  
Italicized—as 'twere.  

&gt;As We went out and in  
Between Her final Room  
And Rooms where Those to be alive  
Tomorrow were, a Blame  
  
&gt;That Others could exist  
While She must finish quite  
A Jealousy for Her arose  
So nearly infinite—  

&gt;We waited while She passed—  
It was a narrow time—  
Too jostled were Our Souls to speak  
At length the notice came.  

&gt;She mentioned, and forgot—  
Then lightly as a Reed   
Bent to the Water, struggled scarce—    
Consented, and was dead—  

&gt;And We—We placed the Hair—  
And drew the Head erect—  
And then an awful leisure was  
Belief to regulate—  

### The first thing that catches my eye,

same as the last time we looked at a Emily Dickinson, is that some words are capitalized (this is not shown on the Bartleby's version, FYI) that wouldn't normally be. On some words it could be understandable, if you take a word like Night or Nature and capitalize them, they become almost like entities. But what about Common, Dying, Us, Jealousy, etc?

### So what is the poem about?

Death, of course, but not of the speaker of the poem, but of a close another. What I really like about Emily Dickinson is that usually they are quite straight forward without becoming dull or unworthy of a more in-depth look.

A thing to note is that Emily Dickinson had several concepts that appear throughout her work, and two of them are present in this poem: the struggle with death and faith.

But somehow the poem does not give me a sense of gloom or despair, there is some restlessness, sure, but there is also something delicate about the whole thing, about dying too:

&gt;Then lightly as a reed

### Some questions

* What is the mood of the poem for you?
* Why do you think are the emotions of the speaker (and group) of the poem? 
* Why do you think that they feel jealousy for the dying woman, and at the same time they had to ""regulate"" their faith. 
* Faith on what and in what way? 
* What do you think that ""narrow time"" means?
* Do you think the capitalization of certain words means anything?
* Does a particular line jump at you?

Because one line does jump at me, it's the third line where the poem shows us that this is not a normal night:

&gt;Except the dying

I'm looking forward to your different point of views!

Cheers!

P.S: I'm sorry if some of the writing is not incredibly cohesive, my English is pretty good but not without fault."

bookclub,"We used to have marginalia posts for all current reads, but dropped them last spring to encourage more separate posts (as well as limited use or evidence of interest in the marginalia threads). Now that it has been a while since that change, and since there are some new people who have joined our bookclub, I am wondering if people would be interested in having marginalia posts again.

There is more information about them [in the Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/wiki/brainstorm_posts), but here is the basic description of what they are:
&gt;Marginalia threads are a form of brainstorming.

&gt;You'd jot ""ironic"" or ""same veil image"" in the margin of a book or on a sticky note or in your memory -- something you notice even if it may not be significant. A comment in the marginalia thread can be scarcely more than that. Any half-baked glimmer of an idea, a guess about where it's going, a note-to-self about how the author is setting things up -- that's the kind of thing that belongs in marginalia."
bookclub,"We are HALFWAY DONE. And I am even more in love with this book than I was before.

A lot of the book, being character-driven, has been somewhat short on plot, and while there's nothing wrong with that, we get to see Tolstoy's plot prowess in action here with a novelette-length subplot about fickle Natasha's failed elopement with Anatole, and Pierre's attempt at damage control.

I think Pierre is finally starting to come into his own; he's seeing Helene for what she is, putting himself in harm's way to correct a wrong, and -- notably -- he backs out of a situation in which he finds himself subject to a duel, evidently having learned from the original snafu. This section is not about Pierre, but he's arguably the character about which we learn most.

bookclub,"Hey everyone!

So I'm taking over the Poem of the Week for the foreseeable future, let's hope it remains active! I don't want to be the only one writing my crazy theories about why *eye* does not rhyme with *symmetry* no matter how much you like William Blake.

So here's the line up for March:

* [""Rime of the Ancient Mariner"" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43997/the-rime-of-the-ancient-mariner-text-of-1834) - March 3
* [""The Last Night That She Lived"" by Emily Dickinson](http://www.bartleby.com/113/4020.html) - March 3
* [""To Earthward"" by Robert Frost](https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/earthward) - March 10 
* [“The Emperor of Ice Cream” by Wallace Stevens](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45234/the-emperor-of-ice-cream) - March 17 
* [""Home Burial"" by Robert Frost](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/53086/home-burial) - March 24

And yes, we have two poems the same day since one was delayed.

I'll also keep the invitation open: if anyone wants to lead the discussion of a specific poem you are more than welcome, just let me know! It would be great having someone with a more in-depth knowledge of a poem speak about it.

Thanks for reading and voting for the poems. Hope you'll join us in March!

"
bookclub,"Welcome back to the poem of the week! And thanks for waiting an extra day for me. This week's selection is [""Hymn to Intellectual Beauty""](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45123/hymn-to-intellectual-beauty) by Percy Bysshe Shelley. It has a bunch of fancy indentations, so despite it being far out of copyright, I won't reproduce it here.

[Here is a link to the first discussion where I outlined how to read a poem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/7h6o9s/poem_of_the_week_the_love_song_of_j_alfred/) And here are the basics in list form. Each number corresponds to a read-through of the poem:

1. Initial, no-pressure read-through
1. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem
1. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc. 
1. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?
1. What do you think the poem is about?

What strikes me first is the format of the poem. Check out those indents. Do the indented and extra-indented portions have relationships to each other, or relationships in common with the lines above? Are they asides or do they denote rhythm? Also look at the capitalization. We have three words in all caps: BEAUTY, LOVELINESS, and SPIRIT; and we have a number of words/phrases that are capitalized as though they're personifications: Power, Demon, etc.

What's the narrative here? When he's a boy he goes looking for ghosts. What does he learn, and what changes? What does he find instead?

What do you think he means by ""intellectual beauty""? I went into this expecting something about scholars and logic, but that's not what I get out of the poem.

Impressions? Thoughts? I really like this one."
bookclub,"

I hear a lot of people saying they dislike Natasha! Who here has read *The Catcher in the Rye*? It's one of those books that most of us have to read in high school, and it's almost universally *reviled* because Holden Caulfield is so goddamn annoying, you just want to throttle him. Stop being so sanctimonious! Stop acting like you know everything! You're like sixteen years old!

I read *Catcher* when I was 20 and I couldn't finish it, I hated Holden so much. I read it again ten years later, and not only finished it, I loved every moment of it, in the vicariously-embarrassed way that keeps me from watching *The Office*. Holden didn't get any less obnoxious -- and I'm not arguing that we shouldn't roll our eyes at Natasha. But suddenly, their behavior rings a lot more true. Holden is one of the best-written characters I've ever read *because he's annoying AF*. Everything that makes him annoying also makes him a completely genuine and heartbreaking teenager. Natasha is the same. She's dramatic, she's angsty, she's impulsive; she's still figuring out things like impulse control, she's impatient because she's young (I remember how long a year was when I was a teenager), she acts like small things are the *worst things ever to happen to her* because she has so little life experience that they actually are. (Compare to how a small child will lose its shit over something little that anyone older would take in stride, or how most people's first teen breakup is one of the hardest no matter the content of the relationship.)

So while I cringe at some of the things she does, I'm also in awe at this grown male author who writes a teenage girl with such realism and understanding. Who writes everyone with such realism and understanding, really. In the first chapter here, there's a point at which ""the countess summoned Sonya to her and, *with a cruelty neither of them expected*, reproached her niece for luring her son away and for ingratitude."" This is such a good line, I think primarily because of the acknowledgement that people often act against their intentions and don't understand why they do what they do. Tolstoy is a master of noting little things like this, and every time I open this book I'm excited about what I'm going to find to get excited about next.

What did you think about this section? How's Pierre's ennui treating you? What about the old prince and his cruel behavior to Marya? Were you disappointed when Boris went for Julie instead of Marya? I want her to be happy and I'm getting impatient waiting for her ship to come. (Maybe her father will die soon? But he's so much fun to hate. Maybe Andrei will tell him off?) Are you excited to see Anna Mikhailovna put her oar in re: Boris and Julie's relationship?"
bookclub,"Here are the last 4 chapter summaries!

**Chapter 21**: Frankenstein is accused of murder and shown the corpse. It is his best friend Clerval, and he collapses. He spends 2 months in a fever, and wakes in prison. However the magistrate has written to Victor's father, and he comes to visit his son. The case goes to court and Victor is freed when it becomes clear he has a solid alibi. He pursuades his father that they should leave for Geneva immediately.

**Chapter 22**: Victor struggles to enjoy being among mankind, as he has ""unchained an enemy among them"". Elizabeth writes that she does not wish to contribute to his unhappiness with their marriage if he does not desire it. Victor replies that he wants to marry her very much, and has an awful secret he can only reveal after the wedding. After arriving home a wedding date is set for 10 days later. Victor starts carrying pistols and a dagger in case his monster tries to attack him. Victor and Elizabeth are married, and start their journey to their newlywed abode.

**Chapter 23**: Victor and Elizabeth stay at an Inn for the night. She can tell her is fearful, and he bids her to retire to bed so she won't have to witness the fight between him and his creation. When he hears her scream he understands the monster has come for her and not him. Elizabeth is dead and Victor is tormented. Victor rushes home, and his father dies of sadness not much later. Victor is kept in a solitary cell as he rages and seems mad. Once he is free he rushes to the magistrate and finally tells his story. The man half believes him, but can do nothing. So Victor decides to commit to destroying his creation himself.

**Chapter 24**: Victor leaves Geneva and pursues the monster around the world. The monster even leaves notes and clues to make sure he stays on his tail. Victor is utterly tormented by all he has lost, and often escapes into sleep in order to see his lost family and friends. Victor ends his tale to Walton by describing just how far North he had chased the fiend. Walton writes that Victor's health is failing and his crew wish to return home. Victor asks Walton to destroy his creation if he dies before it is done. After Victor passes away, Walton finds his monster in the room stricken with grief and horror. They argue, and the monster explains he never enjoyed killing, and he abhorrs himself for the misery he has caused. He declares that he will go as far North as possible before killing himself in a fire so no man can be curious about his remains.

Wow, we're done! Did you story end how you predicted? Who do you pity more, Frankenstein or his monster? Was the book what you expected, or something totally different?"
bookclub,"Wow, a lot to talk about here!

First there's Nikolai and the rest of the Rostovs on the hunt. He's really sinking in the ranks for me, first there was the gambling debt, then the way he treated his father, then the way he was paying it back, now he's *wolf hunting* (I know it was morally fine back then, but I am living in 2018), I'm just... not okay with any of this. The sweet few moments with Natasha didn't do nearly enough to redeem him.

What about Natasha's pining? She's prime marriage age, but it's clear she's also still a child, and suffering under the burden of having to wait for her fiance while not having yet learned patience.

Also the masquerade and the fortune-telling! I don't care if they're traditional, if you put stuff like that in a book, it has some symbolic and/or foretelling purpose. What do you think those are? Does it mean anything that when Sonya and Nikolai met in the barn that they were both dressed like the opposite gender? (I kind of loved that part.) What about Sonya lying that she'd seen Andrei in the mirror?

What did you get out of this section?"
bookclub,"The winner is... 

[*Doctor Zhivago*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Zhivago) by Boris Pastrnak! 

Now, we still need a [read runner](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/wiki/readrunner). Respond here or message the mods to volunteer.

bookclub,"Alright, guys. We've finished it; a lot happened in Part 3 and we leave Montag as he begins his trek back toward the city with his new friends. I want to know about your emotions as you read this part. 

Finding out Mildred and her friends all turned him in was expected, he had rubbed their ignorance into their faces, and they had left angry. Still, I was hurt for him. I could tell he had held out hope that if only he could expose them to the books, they might change their minds and want to experience them as he had. I have felt that hope and that disappointment. How did you experience this revelation? 

I thought the escape was neat, what did you think? 

I love that Montag ends in a place of home. Leaving him with like-minded people who are actively trying to change their situation inspires me. "
bookclub,"Summaries as per usual!

**Chapter 17**: Frankenstein's monster continues to try and convince him he needs to make a second monster. The two debate back and forth, the monster arguing that he is ""malicious because [he is] miserable"". Eventually Frankenstein agrees, and travels back to his family full of dread for the ""abhorred task"" he must complete.

**Chapter 18**: Victor delays his task, and suffers periods of melancholy. His father asks if it is because he is conflicted about being betrothed to Elizabeth, as he may think of her as a sister. Victor reassures his father he very much loves Elizabeth, but must take a trip to England before marrying. Clerval joins him, and they spend 3 months travelling. 

**Chapter 19**: Victor and Clerval spend several months in London before beginning a slow journey to Scotland via many English cities and counties. Victor is still suffering, and describes himself as a ""miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity...intolerable to myself"". Still he delays his tasks, and expects the revenge of the monster on his family and friends at all moments. When they reach Scotland he sequests himself on a sparsely populated island to begin work on his second creature.

**Chapter 20**: Frankenstein begins to make a second monster, but is quickly filled with doubts. He destroys his partial creation and incurs the wrath of his original monster, who threatens to make him ""curse the sun that gazes on your misery"". Frankenstein takes his partial creation out in a boat to dump in the sea. He falls asleep in the boat and wakes up lost, eventually drifting to an Irish town where he is immediately told he is suspected of murder.

Well, that chunk of reading certainly sped up a lot in the last chapter! 
What were your thoughts? Did Frankenstein make the right choice in destroying the second monster he was making? Why did he delay so long in the creation knowing it was infuriating his original creation? Is Clerval dead? Victor sounded like he was mourning and remembering his friend fondly at the end of chapter 18. 

Also one of Frankenstein's issues is that the two monsters may have had offspring and tortured future generations. But couldn't he simply make the new monster sterile??"

bookclub,"[Link to the text.](https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/there-will-come-soft-rains) However, I will also copy the poem below, as it is in the public domain:

***

There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,  
And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;

And frogs in the pools singing at night,  
And wild plum trees in tremulous white,

Robins will wear their feathery fire  
Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;

And not one will know of the war, not one  
Will care at last when it is done.

Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree  
If mankind perished utterly;

And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn,  
Would scarcely know that we were gone. 

***

For lack of a better method, I'm going to rely on /u/Surf_Wax's methodology for reading poetry, but first need to mention a couple of items. First, this poem was published in 1918, just before the end of World War I. Secondly, you may be familiar with the Ray Bradbury short story by the same name, which explores a similar concept but in trademark Bradbury-style.

**1. Initial, no-pressure read-through**

The text is short and seems fairly straightforward, so I guess just did anything jump out at you in your initial read?

Immediately, I was struck by the natural beauty described (if thrown by the casual mention of frogs). It lends to a sort of peaceful appreciation of the nature all around us that we typically ignore.

**2. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem**

What jumped out at you in your initial read--having read the whole poem once (or a few times), what do you make of it now? What mood or tone is Teasdale conveying, and who or what is conveying it?

Again, the poem imparted a peaceful, bucolic, and almost beatific sense to me. The fact that she nailed four of the five senses just makes it the more powerful.

**3. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.**

The poem is comprised of six rhyming couplets in irregular tetrameter. I have no skill in interpreting the importance of these aspects of the poem, so I'll leave that analysis to you. 

**4. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?**

I suppose technically a descriptive piece, this poem feels much more like a persuasive piece or even an argument, without ever stating its point. Rather than railing against the blood and the sorrow of war, Teasdale settles for pointing out its ultimate futility. This nihilism is present in her other works, as well, which makes me think it's more than just an anti-war poem. While it does clearly strike a note against war and conflict, it just keeps going to the futility of war and, ultimately, of all of humanity.

**5. What do you think the poem is about?**

Well, I played my hand early on this one. As I said above, it strikes me as being about the futility of both war and the human race, especially in the face of something as immutable and unending as the passage of time and nature's ability to reclaim.

But what did you see? What have I missed? What do you think of it? "
bookclub,"We have reached Book II Part 4 and are somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% done, depending on your copy! Who's still with me?

The theme this time was love and marriage, which goes together like a horse and carriage... except not, because there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of *marriage* happening. What the actual, Andrei. He goes to ask his father's permission, but Pierre, who seems to have a bit of a crush on Natasha and also some regrets that he's stuck with Helene, privately thinks that Andrei should just disobey his father because he's a grown ass adult, and marry Natasha immediately.

Frankly, I am not all that impressed with Andrei in this section. His inaction reminds me of Pierre, but while I can relate to Pierre's decision paralysis, I can't get behind an adult who's been to war needing Daddy to give his blessing to something that's none of Daddy's business.

And what about Rostov? I admit I *may* not be 100% on this because I *may* have been making mayonnaise in Stardew Valley while I was reading this part, but I gather that the Rostovs' money problems have worsened, and Nikolai, doing the books on his visit, is stomping around like he didn't just blow an upsetting amount of money in a single night.

What did you notice? Are people behaving as you'd hoped or predicted? "
bookclub,"Posting a little early before I head off to bed for the night! Minor chapter summaries for this section:

**Chapter 13**: The monster continues his tale about the cottagers. A foreign woman arrives and everyone is joyful. Her name is Safie and Felix teaches her to speak his language - the monster learns at the same time. He learns about religion, history, empires, governments and more. But this means he also learns he had no money, family, friends or property and he despairs.

**Chapter 14**: Over time he learns the history of the family. It seems Safie's father was wrongly imprisoned and sentenced to death in Paris. Felix - a young man from a well off and respected family - is outraged and promises to help the man escape. He slowly falls in love with Safie in the process, and she planned to stay behind with him once her father had escaped back to Turkey. The father secretly doesn't approve of the match. Meanwhile the Parisian government throws Felix's father and sister in jail, and their money is taken and the family exiled. Safie escapes her father and eventually finds Felix. 

**Chapter 15**: The monster finds 3 books to read, and increases his knowledge and ""ardor for virtue"". He also discovers Victor's journal in the clothes he took, and reads about the process of his creation, and Victor's horror at what he is making. The monster is thrown further into despire and curses the ""hateful day when I received life!"". He still desires the kindness and friendship of the cottages, and decides to visit the blind father alone, as he knows his appearance is terrifying. He does so and it goes well - the father even mentions that he can testify to the sincerity of the monster and will help him. Then the other 3 arrive home. Safie flees, Agatha faints and Felix beats him.

**Chapter 16**: The monster is furious and destroys part of the forest nearby. He decides his plan was too sudden, and goes back to the cottage - but the family has fled. He decides that although he hates his creator, he will seek him out for pity and redress. On his journey to Geneva he saves a girl who is drowning, and is subsequently shot by a man who sees him. He is filled with hate again. Once he reaches Geneva he comes across William in the forest and decides that as children are unprejudiced he will raise him as a companion. When he discovers William is related to his creator he strangles him. He also takes the locket and plants it on Justine who he finds sleeping in a barn. Finally he tells Victor that he cannot leave the mountain until he creates a ""companion...of the same species"" so he is no longer so terribly alone.


So the monster did kill William after all! As well as framing Justine. That answers two questions. 

Do you think what the monster did was understandable? What about how the cottage family react after he shows himself? And will Frankenstein create a second monster?

I'm not convinced he will because when he was saved from the ice at the start of the book, he only seemed to be pursuing a single individual..."

"
bookclub,"We still hanging in there? I enjoyed this part -- we've got Rostov, we've got Andrei, we've got Pierre, we've got Natasha. Thoughts:

Interesting how Pierre worked so hard to do good things for his peasants, and Andrei just kind of unexpectedly made it happen after being all like, ""lol poor people"" in the last section. Why do you think he did it? Does it mean he actually sees them as people, or do you think he holds his old opinions?

Pierre has continued to be a member of the Freemasons, but he seems to be separating them ideologically. He urges them to act, but they're repulsed by what they perceive as his swing toward Illuminism. My copy has an end note that says it was basically the Freemasons but had ""republican political goals"", which I think in this context means that they were for a government of the people, instead of an empire. (Russia wouldn't become a republic until 1917.) It seems like Pierre is just constantly doomed to have good intentions but to be ineffective. Do you think we'll see any character growth in this respect?

And last, is Pierre the most boring journal writer ever? I think so.

What did you find notable about this section?"

bookclub,"Hi everyone! Spoilers in this post for anyone who has not finished Part 2!

There is a lot of contradictory information regarding the timeline of this book so I'd like to propose we accept Faber's rundown of the timeline, which basically asserts it's been about 40 years since books have been outlawed, but the decline of readers started long before that. Fair enough? 

I love Faber's explanation of what qualifies as literature or quality. For me, it's on page 83. ""The good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies."" He goes on to talk about the pores of life and I think Bradbury just captures the reality of it there. So much of what comes out now is sugar... 

Anyway, tell me what you thought of ""The Sieve and the Sand"". Any thoughts are welcome! Did your feelings on Mildred change at all? How do you see Faber? Beatty? Any predictions for the end of the book?

Did your heart drop as they pulled up to Montag's house? I've read the book before and my heart still dropped..."
bookclub,"Hi, everyone! Sorry for the late notice. We will move our discussion of “Rime of the Ancient Mariner” to 3/3."
bookclub,"Sorry it's a little late folks, life got away from me! Minor chapter summaries as per usual:

**Chapter 9**: Justine has been put to death for her alleged crime, and the family moves to their house out of the city walls. Victor takes late night boat rides and considers drowning himself. His whole family grieves, but Victor tortures himself with guilt - ""I, not in deed, but in effect, was the true murderer"". Eventually he leaves on a journey into the mountains.

**Chapter 10**: Victor finds some consolation in nature, and decides to go to the lonely peak of a huge mountain. He meets his monster, and he can speak! The monster begs Frankenstein to listen to his story, and explains how miserable and wretched he is. How men spurn and hate him, so he has taken refuge up the mountain. Frankenstein rages at him, but eventually agrees to hear his tale - ""I felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were"". 

**Chapter 11**: The monster begins his tale. He recounts the beginning of his life, which was overwhelming as he could not distinguish between his senses, or process their input. He found himself in a forest, and explains how he discovered food, nature and fire. He comes across a village and is chased away by the people there. He hides himself in a wooden shack attached to a house, and finds himself watching the family who live there.

**Chapter 12**: Frankenstein's monster continues his tale of watching the family in the cottage - an old blind father, his son Felix and daughter Agatha. He begins to understand some of their language, and in the cover of night does tasks to help them - such as collecting wood and clearing snow. He puzzles over their unhappiness with a life of 'luxury' (fire, food, clothing and company). He also views his own reflection for the first time and is horrifed. The chapter ends with his hope for a joyous future in which he wins the favour and love of the family by being able to speak to them.

Did you enjoy this section? What do you think about Frankensteins monster now - is he a killer?

I was very surprised he could speak. I was also frustrated when Victor hadn't learned from his mistakes and threatened and raged at his creation who was begging for compassion. I'm unsure if the monster is a killer or not - maybe he did it to draw Frankenstein home? He does threaten to ""glut the maw of death...until it be satiated with your **remaining** friends"". Key word remaining...so he knows about William and Justine? 

I did like the monsters story though, his slow accumulation of knowledge and language. How do you think the cottage family will react when he finally shows himself?"
bookclub,"Wow, okay, you guys, who was reminded of modern politics when they read Pierre and Andrei's conversation about peasants? Damn. I know that both sides have been around for thousands of years, but it was still a little jarring to see it play out almost word for word like something you'd hear today.

I thought I was starting to like Andrei, but I think Tolstoy just turned me completely against him. Pierre comes off kind of sweet and noble here, but -- and I love this part -- he's not knowledgeable or savvy enough to understand that he's actually doing harm. It's like when you donate to a charity only to find out that they're killing dogs like PETA or suing other breast cancer nonprofits like Komen.

We've talked a lot about how relatable many of the characters are in many of the classics we've read, despite us being separated from them by sometimes hundreds of years. It actually feels kind of great, at least to me. But what about the futility? Do you think we've made substantial headway on our problems with war and poverty, for example, since W&amp;P was written?

I thought it was interesting that Pierre and Marya had both similarities and contrasts re: religions and morals. I also thought it was interesting how his POV section described her eyes as ""pretty"", when she's been described as plain this whole time.

And what about Rostov? He wants to repay his family within five years; do you think he's going to at all?

What struck you about this section?"
bookclub,"Hi all, welcome to our second scheduled *Frankenstein* post. 

We will discuss chapters 5, 6, 7 and 8 here. I'll do a quick recap of this section so far.

**Chapter 5**: Frankenstein finishes his creation and brings it to life. After one look he is so horrified that he flees the room. He falls into a terrible sleep plagued by nightmares, and wakes to see his ""miserable monster"" reaching for him with a ""grin"" on its face. He flees once again. After wandering the city for hours, he stumbles upon a carriage containing his old friend Henry Clerval. Henry is overjoyed to see him, and gives Frankenstein news of his family. Frankenstein takes Henry back to his place, and is awash with relief to find his monster gone. He then falls ill for some months, with only Clerval to care for him.

**Chapter 6**: Frankenstein receives a letter from Elizabeth full of news from home - she writes about Frankenstein's brothers, Ernest and William. She also writes about a close family friend/servant, Justine. Once Frankenstein is recovered from his illness, he introduces Clerval to the city and to his professors. He discovers that the sight of chemical apparatus, and the discussion of the subject by his teachers would ""renew all his agony"". To avoid this, he decides to study languages with Clerval instead. Frankenstein makes plans to go home, and spends a lovely summer with his friend, which returns his ""feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity"".

**Chapter 7**: Frankenstein receives a letter from his father which explains that his little brother William has been murdered. His father explains how deeply this has affected Elizabeth, and begs Victor to come home with peace in his heart. Frankenstein starts his journey home immediately, but delays his arrival by staying in a near-by town. He decides to visit the spot where William was murdered, and heads out at night in a thunderstorm. To his horror he sees his awful creation for the first time in two years - and is convinced this is the murderer of his brother. He maintains that ""the mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact"". He rushes home to see his family, and discovers that Justine has been accused of Williams murder - he is insistent that she is innocent, something Elizabeth also believes. 

**Chapter 8**: The family goes to Justine's trial to hear the evidence put forth. Justine attempts to act dignified in the face of this horror, but cannot explain away key pieces of evidence - such as the miniature of William's mother found in her pocket that was stolen from William as he was murdered. Her characters witnesses also don't do enough to sway the jury, and she is found guilty. Frankenstein wants to explain that his monster is the real killer, but knows he would sound like a raving lunatic if he tried to explain. The next day Frankenstein hears that Justine has confessed, and he and Elizabeth go to visit her in jail. She explains that she was forced into confessing by her confessor/priest who threatened to excommunicate her. Elizabeth and Frankenstein appeal on Justine's behalf, but she is put to death for her 'crime'. Frankenstein is tortured over the fates of William and Justine - ""the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts"". 

Wow! These 4 chapters gave us a lot. What were you initial impressions? Have your feelings on Victor Frankenstein changed? Do you think his monster is the murderer? Also how did you feel about the big time jumps - apparently it is 6 years since Victor left home!

I really disliked Frankenstein in these chapters. He was horrified by his monster, and immediately washed his hands of his creation! He was overjoyed when the monster disappeared, and didn't try to find him at all. He then spends 2 years larking around with Clerval, and doesn't stop to think about what he has created, or what his creation may be doing. This comes right back to bite him in the ass when he thinks the monster has murdered his brother.
His mistakes cost two people their lives, and yet he remains self-absorbed. He laments that although Justine suffered, ""the tortures of the accused did not equal mine"" as hers was the ""misery of the innocent"". 

I don't know how he can redeem himself after this. "
bookclub,"Okay, you guys, I am burning out on summaries, so in the interest of making me not dread War and Peace days, let’s do something else for a bit.

In II.2.2, Pierre meets a Freemason, who tells him about believing in God. I think often these sorts of conversations are a way for the writer to inject their own philosophy into the text, but I also think that in this case, it has a lot to do with Pierre.

What does Pierre take from this conversation, do you think? He wants to hear more and seems to find it useful, but do you think it’s *actually* going to be useful to him, or is he doing his thing where he allows other people to guide him without fully thinking about what they’re doing? And how is it different from Marya’s experience of religion? (Does it make her happy? Does she have a different opinion of riches vs poverty?)

It’s interesting that he cites women as his predilection in the next chapter, when we have seen that that’s not the case.

What did you think about this section? Rostov’s gambling? Andrei and Marya’s caring for the baby?

And as always, please feel free to make new top-level posts discussing the book! There is so much to talk about here."
bookclub,"Hey everyone! This is the scheduled post for Fahrenheit 451, Part 1. 

So: There are a couple of key points I would like to address. Feel free to comment on my points/questions, or come up with your own. :) 

1) Clarrise. Wow. This character is beautiful. She's got the innocence of youth combined with an unexplained wisdom. What do you think of her? 

2) Mildred. Fuck this woman pisses me off, but I get it at the same time. Don't we all strive to find some version of contentment? But she's willing to ignore everything and treat her husband poorly, to find her's. What do you think of Mrs. Montag? What do you think she was mouthing from the doorway? 

3) Montag has 20 books hidden in his ventilator. 20 books seem like a lot for him not to have read any of them. And what did he do differently that got him caught this time and not the previous 20 times he stole books? 

Alright, what caught your eye? Looking forward to what you all have to say! "
bookclub,"Hi all, welcome to our first discussion post about *Frankenstein*. 

This chunk of reading covered any introductions/prefaces your edition contains, the initial letters and chapters 1, 2, 3 and 4. I will give a little summary of the events so far!

**Letters**: We started the book with a series of letters from a Robert Walton to his sister Margaret. We get a little background on Walton, a man who seems determined to ""tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man"" and has a great passion for exploring. Notably, Walton also writes about his desire to have a deep and special friendship, and despairs that this is not something available to him on his trip. 
On his voyage, he and his crew rescue a man stuck on some ice - a man with wildness in his eyes, but the sort of demeanour that makes Walton think he was once ""a noble creature"". The man admits to searching for someone who fled from him, and seems concerned and miserable. After speaking to Walton about the purpose of his voyage, the man agrees to tell his tale, hoping to impart some wisdom.

**Chapter 1**: The narrator gives us a short history of his parents and their romance. It seems that his father was much older than his mother - and although he loved her deeply, he married her partially in order to make up for the wrongs done to her. The narrator also gains an adopted sister, ""a being heaven-sent"". 

**Chapter 2**: The Narrator continues to relieve his lovely childhood, and explains a little of his temperament - curious and intense. He also introduces us to his friend Henry Clerval. The narrator explains how he came to read the books of ancient scientists/philosophers, and became obsessed with the elixir of life.  Eventually, in the arrogance of youth, he throws off his initial beliefs, but maintains that the truth cannot be known by any man and deems natural history ""as a deformed and abortive creation"".

**Chapter 3**: A sad chapter. The narrators mother dies nursing his sister and he explores how grief affects oneself. He also leaves for school, and meets a professor who lets him know just how much time he wasted studying his ancient philosophers. The narrator does not like this professor, but does seem to enjoy a lecture on chemistry by a second professor. This lecture sets him (now named as Frankenstein) on the course of studying modern scientists and philosophers, men he had previously shunned. 

**Chapter 4**: Frankenstein throws himself into his studies, so much so that he doesn't visit home for 2 years. He is now obsessed with the question of where life came from, and studies death intently. Suddenly Frankenstein is hit with an idea, a light ""so brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple"" he wonders why he is the first to think of it. He knows how to give animation to lifeless matter! Frankenstein begins to create a new species to give life to, a species that "" would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to (him)"". He starts, with single minded pursuit, building his first creation. 

Ok, so that's what we've read so far! What did you think of the start of the book? 

Having never read it before, I was very confused about why we were reading letters about an arctic voyage. I liked the set up though, the idea that although Frankenstein is still in the middle of his own 'story' (chasing someone who fled him) he starts to tell Walton how he ended up where he is. This makes the book more interesting to me - the idea that although Frankenstein is still suffering the consequences of his actions, he wants to tell his story as a warning.

What are you initial impressions? Thoughts on the man Frankenstein? Do you enjoy the writing style so far? "
bookclub,"Welcome to February, and Part II! OMG you guys, this took me so long. I am not allowed to try to do it all on Friday night anymore.

**Chapter 1**

It’s January 1806, 18 months since the beginning of Part I. Rostov and Denisov are on leave, and Rostov takes Denisov home with him. He surprises his family by arriving unannounced. Sonya is still taken with Rostov, and Natasha embarrasses herself by buddying up to Denisov. R and D sleep late and when they wake up the kids tumble in and look through all their crap. Natasha has burned herself to prove her love for Sonya (???). She’s also over Boris and says she won’t marry anyone.

This part jumped out at me: “Rostov was very happy in the love that was shown him, but the first moment of their meeting had been so blissful that his present happiness seemed to little to him, and he kept waiting for more, and more, and more.""

We meet:

* Dmitri, a servant
* Mikhailo, an old servant
* Prokofy, a footman

**Chapter 2**

Rostov is suddenly dignified and no longer childish. He has no time for Sonya, either! His father, who has mortgaged his estates to have cash on hand (or so I gather?) arranges a dinner at the English Club for Prince Bagration.

Anna Mikhailovna (annoying pushy Anna) arrives! She steals Rostov’s errands but he’s happy about it, so whatever. She also arrives with news, which she very casually mentions in a way to get the Rostovs to ask her about it. Turns out Dolokhov has… boned Helene (Pierre’s wife)? Or been alone with her in such a way that is suggestive of having boned?

Then we get some background about how Bagration came to be so celebrated in Moscow, and some updates on all the characters… including Andrei, whose death is mentioned almost in passing. Anyone else get an emotional gut-punch that was actually kind of worse than it would have been via a drawn-out death scene?

We meet:

* Feoktist, a chef
* Mitenka, a steward
* Maximka, a gardener

**Chapter 3**

The party! Pierre is there and moping. Bagration arrives, and he’s awkward. Someone brings him a bunch of poetry and he wilts, but dinner is announced and he is saved. Older Rostov makes his Rostov the younger talk to Bagration even though they’re not really well-acquainted. A toast is made to the emperor and Rostov gets all emotional again. His dad cries when they toast to him, lol.

We meet:

* Count Rastopchin, an old man
* Valuev, an old man (sounds like a grocery mart)
* Naryshkin, an old man
* Shinshin
* Bekleshov
* Fyodor Petrovich Uvarov

**Chapter 4**

Pierre reflects on Dolokhov. Also, everyone is being mean to Pierre. Finally Pierre can’t take it and he reacts badly to something Dolokhov does… and gets himself into a duel. Good job, Pierre.

The next day he meets Dolokhov in the woods. Even in this situation, Pierre is giving him allowances: “Maybe I would have done the same thing in his place. I even certainly would have done the same thing.” However, instead of apologizing as his second (Nesvitsky) urges him to do, Pierre goes for it! Even though he’s never shot a gun.

**Chapter 5**

“It was obvious that the affair, having begun so lightly, could no longer be prevented by anything, that it was going on by itself, independently of men’s will, and would be accomplished.” (“The Ten Duel Commandments” from *Hamilton* is stuck in my head, incidentally.) Pierre shoots, and though he can’t see it at first, he has shot Dolokhov! Evidently the rules allow Dolokhov to shoot him, and Pierre sheepishly makes himself a good target, but Dolokhov misses. Nesvitsky takes Pierre home, and Denisov and Rostov take Dolokhov back to Moscow. Rostov goes to talk to Dolokhov’s mother and tell her that he’s dying.

**Chapter 6**

Pierre gets home and tries to sleep, but can’t. He recollects his relationship with his wife for awhile, and decides to leave her. She comes in the next morning and is horrible to him. Apparently she wasn’t boning Dolokhov? But she takes the opportunity to tell Pierre how awful he is. He snaps and rushes her. Then a week later he gives her power of attorney (wtf Pierre) and goes to St. Petersburg.

**Chapter 7**

Back to Bald Hills and the Bolkonskys (Andrei’s people). Andrei’s body was not found! When Marya is told that Andrei is dead, she reacts with… the book uses the word “joy”, but it sounds more like competence, like she knows what to do and sort of comes into her own here. Not sure, though. She starts to tell Liza (Andrei’s pregnant wife) a bunch of times but doesn’t. Marya doesn’t lose hope, but Andrei’s father does.

**Chapter 8**

Liza’s breakfast has disagreed with her. A midwife is called for. Marya seems to think that the baby is coming. She waits.

Marya’s old nanny tells her the story of her birth. The doctor arrives — but wait! It’s not the doctor, it’s Andrei! He’s alive! I am so relieved right now. He runs to his wife’s rooms.

**Chapter 9**

Andrei goes in to see his wife, but she’s too messed up to be fully aware of what’s just happened. He leaves and paces awhile, and the baby is born! But when he goes in to see his wife and child, he finds Lize dead on the bed. Andrei goes to see his father, who hugs him and cries. Later on, Lize is buried and the baby is baptized.

Some notes about this part: Liza’s eyes do a lot of speaking, but I don’t think Tolstoy ever says that they speak her actual thoughts. I wonder if these are her thoughts, or the thoughts that Andrei and his father are worried that she has.

We meet:

* Prince Nikolai Andreich

**Chapter 10**

Back to the Moscow crowd. Rostov has a fancy new job, and Dolokhov doesn’t die! If anything, he’s gotten more annoying. It’s winter 1806 now. All the boys are at the Rostovs’ place courting the young ladies. Natasha hates Dolokhov and thinks he’s been unfair to Pierre (girl, same). Dolokhov has an enormous crush on Sonya.

The war gains some traction again. Rostov and Denisov are going back to it after the holidays.

We meet:

* Marya Ivanovna, Dolokhov’s mom

**Chapter 11**

Oh god almost done

Rostov (referred to here as Nikolai) is having a goodbye dinner. When he gets home, it’s clear that something has happened! Turns out that Dolokhov proposed to Sonya, who refused him, lol. Nikolai is pleased by this. He tells Sonya he loves her, and she tells him she loves him only as a brother.

* Iogel, a dancing master

**Chapter 12**

A ball! The Rostov girls are super pretty. Denisov admires Natasha, and Rostov, under pressure to dance, asks Sonya to dance. Denisov does a fancy little thing and then, even though he’s suddenly in demand as a dancing partner, hangs out with Natasha the whole night."
bookclub,"Look at us! We finished the first quarter of *War and Peace*!

**Chapter 12**

A war council happens and there is a lot of communicating by looks. Andrei and the others decide on a plan of attack. Andrei daydreams about being a hero.

**Chapter 13**

Rostov, patrolling the picket line, is falling asleep on his horse when he hears a noise. He goes to check it out with a few hussars and gets shot at. Excited, he asks Prince Bagration to put him in the first squadron so he sees some action, and the request is granted.

**Chapter 14**

Morning. They clean up camp, throw what they can onto the fires, and begin to march in the heavy fog. Confusion ensues. A group of soldiers meets the French in an especially foggy basin and they shoot at each other, but the action doesn’t really begin until the sun comes out and Napoleon gives the signal.

**Chapter 15**

More waiting and confusion. The emperor asks Kutuzov what’s going on, and Kutuzov tells the emperor that he’s waiting for the columns to be all lined up. The emperor is not okay with this. 

We meet:

* Miloradovich, a general

**Chapter 16**

The Apsherontsy regiment (Russians, I’m not sure why they get a name) panics and everyone flees back to where they came from, causing a stampede. The French shoot at Kutuzov, who gets hit in the leg. Andrei takes control and leads the soldiers back to the French. He is evidently hit or shot in the head.

What’s the deal with the red-haired artillerist? Do you think what happened there could be symbolic of the war as a whole, or at least this battle? Does it have any significance re: what happens to Andrei immediately afterward?

**Chapter 17**

Miles away, Bagration sends Rostov off to ask the commander in chief if they can start the action where they are. Rostov rides off across the lines and observes that the fighting gets more intense the farther he goes, but the battle is nearly as chaotic to him as it is to me.

Eventually he finds Boris, who tells him about his first battle. He rides on and finds groups of fleeing men. Turns out the Russians and the Austrians were shooting at each other. It’s not clear that this was an accident, either. By the end of the chapter, he has not found the emperor.

**Chapter 18**

As though he’s traveling through time and not distance (well, it’s getting later, but you know what I mean), Rostov keeps noticing the breakdown of the army the farther he goes. Rumor is that the emperor is wounded and the commander in chief might be dead? But it turns out the emperor is fine and is trying to jump over a ditch on his horse. Rostov, suddenly shy, doesn’t know what to say, but Toll appears and comforts the emperor, who is now crying.

I think Dolokhov might get killed by a cannon, but it’s hard to tell.

**Chapter 19**

Napoleon finds the wounded Andrei. Andrei is too hurt to care; his wound is a much bigger thing to him in the moment than Napoleon is. Napoleon tells his aide to get him help, and when Andrei wakes up he’s a POW. Napoleon arrives and praises the Russians like there aren’t any hurt feelings over the whole war thing.

Andrei laments that he doesn’t really believe in God like his sister Marya does and thus gets no comfort from it. The doctor thinks he’ll die, and he and the other wounded are given to the villagers (I think?) to care for.

We meet:

* Prince Repnin, an officer and Andrei’s fellow prisoner
* Lieutenant Sukhtelen

Thoughts about this section? I’m kind of exhausted after reading it — I thought it captured the monotony of battle without being particularly monotonous; Rostov’s reaction to seeing the emperor and not knowing what to do with himself was particularly believable."
bookclub,"Okay, first of all, you guys knocked it out of the park last week when I was sick. A+. I should get sick more often. Well done!

This week we're discussing ""Pioneers! O Pioneers!"" by Walt Whitman. It's a little too long to quote, so [here's a link](http://www.bartleby.com/142/153.html).

[Here is a link to the first discussion where I outlined how to read a poem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/7h6o9s/poem_of_the_week_the_love_song_of_j_alfred/) And here are the basics in list form. Each number corresponds to a read-through of the poem:

1. Initial, no-pressure read-through
1. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem
1. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc. 
1. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?
1. What do you think the poem is about?

If I wasn’t like twenty feet from the Pacific Ocean, I’d be ready to pack up a horse and wagon and start west. If ever a poem captured the romance of an era, it’s this one. This is some enthusiastic stuff. Just Rosetti with her fruit in “Goblin Market”, Whitman uses language judiciously to get the spirit of pioneering across. Look at some of these bits:

&gt; Have you your pistols? have you your sharp-edged axes?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Down the edges, through the passes, up the mountains steep,
&gt;
&gt; Conquering, holding, daring, venturing as we go the unknown ways,

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; We primeval forests felling,
&gt;
&gt; We the rivers stemming, vexing we and piercing deep the mines within,

&amp;nbsp;

I’d go on but it’s almost the entire poem. He makes it sound like an army of youthful pioneers, marching across the prairies, lumberjacks and fishermen, “taming” the west like it’s a war to be won. (It reminds me of Rostov’s pride and his willingness to die for the Russian emperor, a little.)

At the time this was written (1865), the west was sparsely populated with white and some black Americans. The Donner party had reached Sacramento twenty years earlier, and the Mormons had been in Utah for more than a decade. The first Homestead Act was three years old, and the Ingalls family would move from Wisconsin to Kansas in just four years. There was very much a sense of romance surrounding the westward movement.

The poem has 26 stanzas but it’s kind of all over the place. No rhyming, no real rhythm. Lots of repetition, though, beyond the obvious, and lots and lots of alliteration. Interestingly, while Whitman is speaking about breaking ground, his form was also somewhat groundbreaking (at least according to Shmoop, which I’m using for reference) — [the long lines he uses were somewhat unusual](https://www.shmoop.com/pioneers-o-pioneers/calling-card.html) at the time.

I also want to call your attention back to [“Let America Be America Again” by Langston Hughes](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/7iqsop/poem_of_the_week_let_america_be_america_again_by/). He uses the line “O, Pioneers!” in the poem as a deliberate callback to Whitman’s poem, noting that *his* people, and many others (Indians get a mention; they are conspicuously absent from “Pioneers, O Pioneers!"") were left behind by the American dream and westward expansion.

What are your thoughts on the Whitman poem? Do you think Hughes’s functions as a rebuttal?"
bookclub,"Okay, that was enough peace. Time for war.

**Chapter 7**

Rostov has gotten a promotion and a new horse. He finds Boris and Berg! (We met Berg earlier, in Part 1.) Also a letter of recommendation, but he doesn’t want the job he’s being recommended to. He relates the story of how he was wounded but embellishes a lot. Prince Andrei arrives and tacitly dislikes Rostov’s story. Rostov is angry and embarrassed and they have kind of an oddly adversarial conversation, in which we learn that they don’t actually know each other. Andrei leaves and Rostov hates him but also wants to be his friend.

(I just want to take a minute and say how much I love these little details about people’s motivations and feelings.)

**Chapter 8**

The emperor shows up to review the troops, and Rostov, lined up with everyone else on his horse, is euphoric. It’s kind of adorable. He wants to die for the emperor!

**Chapter 9**

Boris goes to visit Prince Andrei, who might be able to help him out of the guards and into some battles. They go to find Andrei’s buddy Prince Dolgorukov, who tells them about how they’re going to upset Napoleon. Dolgorukov gets called away to chill with the emperor before Andrei can ask him to do anything for Boris, but Boris is okay with it because he’s right next to important people (Dolgorukov and the nearby emperor)! Andrei has an odd confrontation with Prince Adam Czartoryski.

We meet:

* Prince Dolgorukov, an adjutant general
* Prince Adam Czartoryski, a short guy who Andrei hates

**Chapter 10**

Rostov sees zero action and is bored. The soldiers returning bring back a bunch of French POWs and one dragoon who is unaware he’s been captured. Rostov buys the horse. Now he has two horses. And the emperor is back! Rostov has a crush on him, sort of. Denisov points this out and Rostov is upset.

We meet:

* Captain Kirsten, an old guy

**Chapter 11**

The soveriegn is a little bit of a sensitive soul. Some military stuff happens. Andrei goes to talk to Dolgorukov. Turns out D saw Napoleon, wow! He was unimpressed. Kutuzov is not optimistic about the battle that will happen the next day.

* Villiers, a court physician
* Count Tolstoy, a count

What did you think was remarkable about this section? NGL, it was probably my least favorite part of the book, and I hope that the next section (more war, and the end of Book I) is a little better."
bookclub,"This is a fairly short read, with only 3 parts. We are going to do this read fairly quickly, over the first 3 weeks of the month, checking in during the middle of the week, each Wednesday.

bookclub,"Hi everyone! 

I'll be read runner for one of February's picks - *Frankenstein*. 
*Frankenstein* has been done before on this sub, back in 2012, but the mods are kindly letting us do it again. 

I've picked a pretty frequent schedule for this read - roughly 4 chapters every 4 days. *Frankenstein* is a short read (most editions come in easily under 300 pages), so frequent discussions will keep us involved all month long - even if you zoom ahead and finish early!

**4th Feb**: Preface and chapters 1, 2, 3 and 4

**8th Feb**: Chapters 5, 6, 7 and 8 

**12th Feb**: Chapters 9, 10, 11 and 12

**16th Feb**: Chapters 13, 14, 15 and 16

**20th Feb**: Chapters 17, 18, 19 and 20

**24th Feb**: Chapters 21, 22, 23 and 24

**28th Feb**: Marginalia, Final Impressions etc.

I'm one of those rare characters who has never read *Frankenstein* before - nor have I seen a screen adaption. I know next to nothing about the plot beyond the obvious, that Frankenstein creates a monster. So i'm pretty excited to finally read this book, and have some great discussions about it! 

As always, please feel free to make your own posts about the book - any discussion is good discussion :) "
bookclub,"A short little section this time. I could have kept going, actually. I don’t dislike any of the storylines or any of the characters — they’re not all likable, but they’re all interesting. This frequent hopping around and short chapters help to keep my interest, but it’s also helpful that Tolstoy is a compelling writer and seems to know all his characters very well.

**Chapter 3**

Vassily and Anatole visit Andrei’s dad, Prince Nikolai, who is the guy out in the Moscow countryside who’s a jerk to his daughter. He hates Vassily and has a goddamn fit at the steward when the steward has the road plowed to make it easier for Vassily to get there. They re-cover the road, lol, and Vassily needs extra help when he arrives.

Anatole is pretty and Marya is not, and Marya kind of hates herself for it. The other ladies (Lise/Elizaveta/the little princess and Mlle Bourienne) make her change about a hundred times but it turns out the problem is her face. She goes to dinner as she is and finds comfort in her religion.

We meet:

* Alpatych, the steward

**Chapter 4**

Anatole assumes he’s going to marry Marya regardless, but he extra likes Mlle Bourienne. Nikolai, back in his study, is thinking about all this and figures Marya will be unhappy with Anatole, completely missing that she’s already unhappy in his house. He comes out and proceeds to make her cry, good job Nikolai.

Vassily has the marriage discussion with Nikolai and Nikolai agrees. Meanwhile, Mlle Bourienne is having her own fantasies about Anatole.

**Chapter 5**

No one can sleep except Anatole. In the morning, Mlle Bournienne and Anatole meet each other in the garden, and Marya, who’s been sent off to decide whether to accept the proposal, catches them in each other’s arms. Amazingly, she comforts Mlle Bourienne, and then, when asked, she says she doesn’t want to marry, ever.

Check out Prince Nikolai’s behavior in this section, by the way — what he wants and what he acts like he wants are two very different things.

**Chapter 6**

Count Rostov hears that his son was wounded and Anna Mikhailovna, who is living with him for some reason, goes to comfort him. They keep it from his wife but Natasha (the 13-year-old) picks it up pretty quick, and with uncharacteristic maturity, doesn’t ask about it in front of her mother. She tells Sonya (the cousin) when she gets it out of Anna, though! There’s a lovely little detail in here about Natasha not crying until she sees Sonya’s reaction and it sinks in."
bookclub,"Hello! We started this voting cycle with a goal of one book for February; however, we have overwhelming support for two selections. Under our Evergreen Rule, we have the ability to make that a reality, but it is up to you, the community. 

The winner for February (by 8 votes, mind you) is *Fahrenheit 451* by Ray Bradbury! 

We had 18 votes for *Frankenstein* by Mary Shelley this cycle. *Frankenstein* was selected way back in March 2012, and qualifies for discussion at any time under what we call **The Evergreen Rule** which basically states ""Once selected, always on topic."" So, if a person wants to read *Frankenstein* on their own and post, go for it! However, I know the draw of this sub lies in the organized reads, punctuated by a regular discussion about a selection. As such, if any person wants to create a schedule and be the [read runner](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/wiki/readrunner) on *Frankenstein*, we will put your schedule in the sidebar and promote the read as a normal February selection. 

We already have The Big Read, *War and Peace*, and we will also have *Fahrenheit 451*, otherwise we might add *Frankenstein* as a secondary selection for February, but as it stands, I think we can only incorporate it if there is a community member leading the charge under The Evergreen Rule. 

Thanks for your votes and your consideration and patience this month! :) "
bookclub,"Here are our poetry selections for February:

""Rime"" was about 50 lines longer than the parameters I specified in the voting post, but it also had two more upvotes than the next poem down, so I figure the community has spoken.

If you would like to lead discussion on any of these, please comment here or shoot me a PM. I generally fly by the seat of my pants on these; I link, reproduce the poem if it's in the public domain (all of these are), post a link on how to interpret a poem, and say some things about it. I might do some research on cliffsnotes.com or one of those sites to find discussion questions or see if I was off base on what I thought the poem was about. You don't have to be a poetry expert, I'm certainly not.

bookclub,"We got war, we got peace, we got your neighborhood read runner writing this at the last minute on Friday night. Which is most tense? I don’t know!

**Chapter 16**

Andrei walks around and thinks about tactics, and then he overhears a conversation between officers about death. I can’t remember who the atheist is — is it Andrei? If so, he has a kindred spirit, because Tushin, the guy we saw without shoes previously, says there’s no heaven. Then a wild cannonball appears!

**Chapter 17**

Prince Andrei finds Prince Bagration and gives him a report. Zherkov, the guy who made fun of Mack, is also there, cracking jokes. There’s absolute chaos… a Cossack is killed in front of them, Tushin’s company is firing cannons at the village. A lot of this chapter is about Andrei’s observation of Bagration — his ability to lead, to suggest orders rather than bark them, and his unflappability in the face of battle.

**Chapter 18**

Bagration and Andrei get closer to the fighting. They encounter the wounded, the tired, and the silly. Both Russians and French march toward each other and meet.

**Chapter 19**

Zherkov is sent into danger on an errand, and he loses his nerve. I would too. He’s supposed to tell the left flank to retreat, but he doesn’t. The officers there argue about what to do. The German wants to retreat, the Russian urges him to attack. While they’re arguing, they’re surrounded. Rostov is in this regiment, and his horse is shot out from under him. The French run toward him and frightened, he flings his pistol at them (lol) and runs away. He seems to get away, but it’s hard to tell.

We meet:

* Bandarchuk, a hussar

**Chapter 20**

Timokhin, Dolokhov’s captain, drunkenly scares off the French. Dolokhov is with him, and with a French prisoner in hand, appeals to Major Ekonomov: he’s been wounded in battle and he’s still done some heroic stuff. Looks like he’s angling to get his promotion back. Tushin, meanwhile, has set the village on fire (with his cannons) and is in high spirits despite his regiment having been nearly halved. Prince Andrei arrives and tells him to retreat.

Now that we’re seeing characters in action, as opposed to looking on while it happens, what differences do you see between them?

We meet:

* Major Ekonomov

**Chapter 21**

Good news! Rostov has survived. He is completely whiny, which… justified. His injuries appear to be more psychological than physical. Tushin takes in a number of strays, including Rostov.

Bagration is in a house having dinner in front of a French prisoner, who he is not feeding. The battle is being recounted for him. Tushin appears and is upbraided, but he and Bagration just kind of look at each other timidly. Andrei rescues him. Rostov, meanwhile, is homesick.

**Chapter 1**

Back to peace! Vassily is here. Also, he needs 40K, so the obvious thing to do is have Elena/Helene, his daughter, married to Pierre. And everyone wants a piece of Pierre now! He feels well-liked and important, but it sounds more like he’s being taken advantage of. Vassily has obviously talked to Anna Pavlovna, who’s trying to push Pierre toward Helene.

**Chapter 2**

Vassily feels entitled to Pierre’s gratefulness. He sets something up for Helene’s name day (and refers to her as Leyla here — same character, though). Pierre is torn! He doesn’t want to marry Helene, but he can’t seem to do anything about it.

At the party, does your copy switch to present tense for a couple of paragraphs? Why do you think Tolstoy did that?

Pierre just sort of lets the moment go on, awkwardly, until Vassily walks back in and acts like Pierre has proposed. And Pierre and Helene go along with it. She kisses him, and a month and a half later, they’re married. I, uh, did not expect that. Good job standing up for yourself, Pierre!

What did you think of this section? Do we still love Pierre? I’m a little bit appalled at his cowardice. How do you think it compares to the battlefield behavior we’ve seen? Pierre is too afraid to disappoint anyone; is he running away from it in the same way that Zherkov avoided his errand? Or is he running full tilt into battle because he knows it’s expected of him?"
bookclub,"&gt; Hey, everyone! /u/wthisccchanel asked me to post this when I did W&amp;P this morning. All credit to them!

Hey guys! Glad to see you still sticking with this read. It’s been a wild ride, hasn’t it? We’re almost halfway through yet I have SO many questions! Let’s get to it.

I found Chapter XIII unnerving, but it was a definite page-turner. It’s already scary seeing the house (literally) unfold from an adult’s point-of-view, let alone a child’s. How do you think all this house-business will impact Chad and Daisy? Do you think they will just regard it as a childhood nightmare?

Well, Tom definitely is my favourite character and I am gutted to see him go (die?). What did you think of him saving Daisy? What do you think of the house now? I imagined it collapsing on itself and can’t wrap my head around the entire thing. If I were Navy or Karen or even the real estate agent, I would want a word with the person who built this thing!

I found the parts with [ missing bits in the brackets ] annoying to read, but it surely added a new effect to the reading experience. I ended up pencilling in the missing letters/words if I knew them, have you guys been annotating your book too?

The XXXXXXXXXX bits were even more frustrating to read than the [ empty spaces ] ones. What did you guys think of all this omission?

I always had a cold feeling towards Karen, but during Chapters XIV and XV, I warmed up to her and it made me understand her more, getting more emphatic of her. Are the people she interviewed real? I recognised a certain King on page 361.

I probably would not have been able to fully comprehend the whole segment about isotopes, protons/neutrons, and particles-from-the-beginning-of-time that make up the house in Chapter XVI, but I still wanted to read about it. Are you finding that you want more out of this book than what the author is giving you?

Loved Navy’s letters to Karen in Chapter XVII. This chapter really showed us a deeper view into their topsy-turvy relationship.

And again with the experimental/annoying format. “F” for “s” in Chapter XVIII. Jefuf. Chapter XIX was a succinct section on Navy’s work before the house, sort of a neat little read.

I think, like Johnny, I am going insane as well. Are you?"

bookclub,"**Chapter 7**

Nesvitsky is stuck on the bridge amidst a crowd of soldiers trying to cross.

**Chapter 8**

There is some confusion over setting *feuer* to a bridge and Rostov goes to do it, but he hasn’t brought anything to do it with, so he stands around uselessly. Nesvitsky watches the battle as though he’s in the upper bleachers of a football game. 

**Chapter 9**

Andrei brings good news to the minister of war, but while he’s excited about it initially, the minister dampens his enthusiasm. I’m noticing a bit of a theme in this section of things not going quite as their protagonists expected them to — Andrei’s news, Rostov’s first battle experience.

**Chapter 10**

Andrei goes to his friend Bilibin’s house and freshens up. Bilibin is a bit of a jerk about the victory, but Andrei keeps his temper. We find out that the French have captured Vienna. Right around this chapter, Andrei starts being referred to occasionally as Bolkonsky.

We meet:

* Bilibin, a Russian diplomat who is Andrei’s friend, and who I will be forever misreading as “Bilirubin""

**Chapter 11**

We haven’t seen Ippolit Kuragin in a long time, since maybe I.1.3, at the party in St. Petersburg, where he didn’t do a whole lot. He’s Vassily Kuragin’s son, the non-screwup. He and Bilibin have a snob club, and Andrei hangs out around them for awhile before casually mentioning he has to go see the Austrian emperor and impressing them all.

**Chapter 12**

Andrei fills the emperor in on the goings-on of the battlefield and gets an award. He gets back to Bilibin’s place to find him evacuating; evidently some Gascons (d’Artagnan??) have tricked the Russians and gotten the French army across the bridge. Andrei has a fantasy about how he’s going to be responsible for turning the army’s luck around. Bilibin reflects that they’ve been “Macked”, lol. Andrei runs off to rejoin the army.

**Chapter 13**

Prince Andrei fights his way back through the retreating Russian army, to find that they’re supposed to battle the French. Prince Bagration heads off into probable doom while Kutuzov keeps Andrei with him, despite Andrei’s wish to follow Bagration.

We meet:

* Prince Bagration
* Weyrother, an Austrian general

**Chapter 14**

A trick happens and Bagration’s troops don’t die at the hands of the French, and somehow this positively affects Kutuzov’s. My downstairs neighbor is playing super loud music and I can’t concentrate.

**Chapter 15**

Andrei goes to Bagration and tours the camp. He encounters Dolokhov, who’s at the line confounding a French soldier by speaking in rapid French.

We meet:

* Captain Tushin, who has no boots
* Sidorov, Dolokhov’s… company commander? Friend?"

In this thread, please nominate books in individual comments and upvote any of which you'd participate in the discussion.  *Nominate one title per comment* so we can upvote that specific title.

Voting will close Tuesday, January 23, in the evening PST. The selection will be announced Wednesday morning.

***Remember*** - You can post separate threads ""Campaigning"" for your (or someone else's nomination) as described [here](https://redd.it/6thwlk)


 * Nominate as many titles as you want (one per comment), and vote for any you'd participate in.

 * Consider nominating books from our [Accumulator](https://redd.it/65523g), and if you'd like the group to read something that doesn't get chosen this month, add it there.

 HAPPY VOTING!"
bookclub,"Let's do another month of poems. There are four Saturdays in February, so we will take the four poems with the highest number of votes.

Please, nominate several poems, including any that didn't get selected last time that you still want to see us do! One poem per comment so voting is easy, just like we do for novels. The only requirement is that the poem is freely available online (please provide a link), wasn’t written by you or your best friend, and isn’t super long — let’s use Christina Rosetti’s “Goblin Market” as a benchmark and keep it to ~575 lines or below for now. Aside from that, anything goes: any period, any poet, free verse or structured.

Poems that we've done or are doing that are ineligible for nomination:

* ""Auld Lang Syne"" by Robert Burns

bookclub,"This week we are doing [“Goblin Market” by Christina Rosetti](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44996/goblin-market). I’m not going to reproduce the whole thing here because it’s pretty long.

[Here is a link to the first discussion where I outlined how to read a poem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/7h6o9s/poem_of_the_week_the_love_song_of_j_alfred/) And here are the basics in list form. Each number corresponds to a read-through of the poem:

1. Initial, no-pressure read-through
1. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem
1. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc. 
1. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?
1. What do you think the poem is about?

A lot of things leap out at me, particularly the descriptions of the fruit, the various animals, but what I notice more than anything else is the thinly-veiled sexuality of the poem. Look at some of this:

&gt; Then suck’d their fruit globes fair or red: 

&gt; Sweeter than honey from the rock, 

&gt; Stronger than man-rejoicing wine, 

&gt; Clearer than water flow’d that juice; 

&gt; She never tasted such before, 

&gt; How should it cloy with length of use? 

&gt; She suck’d and suck’d and suck’d the more 

&gt; Fruits which that unknown orchard bore; 

&gt; She suck’d until her lips were sore; 

&gt; Then flung the emptied rinds away 

Then later:

&gt; She cried, “Laura,” up the garden, 

&gt; “Did you miss me? 

&gt; Come and kiss me. 

&gt; Never mind my bruises, 

&gt; Hug me, kiss me, suck my juices 

&gt; Squeez’d from goblin fruits for you, 

&gt; Goblin pulp and goblin dew. 

&gt; Eat me, drink me, love me; 

&gt; Laura, make much of me; 

&gt; For your sake I have braved the glen 

&gt; And had to do with goblin merchant men.”

And earlier, check out this part:

&gt; Though the goblins cuff’d and caught her, 

&gt; Coax’d and fought her, 

&gt; Bullied and besought her, 

&gt; Scratch’d her, pinch’d her black as ink, 

&gt; Kick’d and knock’d her, 

&gt; Maul’d and mock’d her, 

&gt; Lizzie utter’d not a word; 

&gt; Would not open lip from lip 

&gt; Lest they should cram a mouthful in: 

&gt; But laugh’d in heart to feel the drip 

&gt; Of juice that syrupp’d all her face, 

&gt; And lodg’d in dimples of her chin, 

&gt; And streak’d her neck which quaked like curd. 

The whole poem has the feel of a fable, or a moral tale: two sisters, one succumbs to temptation and pays for it; the other sacrifices herself to save her sister. Rosetti wrote this poem while she was volunteering at a penitentiary, which meant something somewhat different in those days — it was a place for penitents, or in this case a home for fallen women. She was also a deeply religious Anglican. She was also adamant that this was a children’s poem.

I can’t get my head around the meter of the poem. I did a lot of tripping over my own feet while reading it; lines seemed to swerve unexpectedly and I thought the rhymes were relatively unpredictable. Something I’ve learned from the poems of the week is that poets absolutely do things on purpose, but I can’t get my head around *why* the erratic changes here. Reading it was somewhat disorienting… was her intention to illustrate Laura’s disorientation or the chaos of the marketplace? Is her poem wrong-footed because Laura is?

What do you think of the poem? Did you catch any non-fruit symbols? What about the animals and the moon? I really encourage you to look up various interpretations for this, too, as some of them have been somewhat creative over the years."
bookclub,"I clearly ended this section at the wrong place, because we get one more chapter of peace, and then it’s on to war. I did not expect the war part to be quite as good as the peace part, but I’m totally into it.

Something I’d like to bring your attention to is the wry, black comedic way that war is discussed here. I’ve seen this in one book before, a recent Martin Amis novel called *The Zone of Interest* about the Holocaust. It’s hard to do and requires that your audience be in on the joke, which… again, Holocaust, war, hard to do. Tolstoy’s audience wasn’t far removed from the atrocity of this war, either. I have no idea how these parts were received, but he does the same thing here: comedy while atrocity is happening, often it’s ironic, and you have to know he’s commenting on people — for example, in the very last part, the officers eating pies while the battle rages. This is the last line in Chapter 6:

[A shell flies toward the enemy.] “The faces of the soldiers and officers cheered up at this sound; everybody stood up and began watching the movements of our troops below, visible as on the palm of the hand, and further away the movements of the advancing enemy. Just then the sun came all the way out from behind the clouds, and the beautiful sound of the solitary shot and the shining of the bright sun merged into one cheerful and merry impression.”

**Chapter 25**

Princess Marya gets her brother Andrei alone on the night of his departure. Weirdly, she lies to him about how much of an asshole their father is to her. She gives him an icon to wear. Andrei admits to her that he’s unhappy in his marriage and thinks Lise is too. Their father also seems to have figured this out. Andrei leaves.

Really interesting — notice how differently the father treats Andrei than he treats Marya.

And we’ve gotten through Book 1, Part 1! That was very peaceful, now it’s time for some war.

**Chapter 1**

An infantry regiment has been made to change into their fancy marching uniforms, but it turns out that the commander in chief wants them to look absolutely pitiful, whoops. They have to change and now everyone is in gray, except for Dolokhov, who was demoted because of the business with the bear. (I love that it had consequences instead of just being a hilarious story.)

We meet:

* The regimental commander, who isn’t named
* Timokhin, the captain who gets yelled at, we’ll learn his name next chapter
* Dolokhov is here too and it’s been awhile since we’ve seen him

**Chapter 2**

Kutuzov arrives and he’s less of a blowhard than the regimental commander. Andrei Bolkonsky is with him (because his father wrote to Kutuzov to recommend him) and so is a guy called Nesvitsky, who has a case of the giggles. Kutuzov eyeballs Dolokhov and walks away, and then we hear that Dolokhov “all but killed a Jew” in Poland, but boys will be boys, I guess.

The soldiers gossip and call Bonaparte “Boonapart” for some reason (this is distinct in my copy from Buonopart). They march and sing. Zherkov arrives. He used to be under Dolokhov, is now evidently superior to him, as he’s riding a horse and Dolokhov is not (correct me if I’m wrong).

We meet:

* Kutuzov, the commander in chief
* Nesvitsky, a giggly staff officer
* Zherkov, a hussar cornet, no idea what that means except he’s cavalry

**Chapter 3**

Andrei is asked to write a report but he doesn’t seem to know what to do. A mysterious general appears, and he turns out to be the Austrian general Mack, with news of his defeat and the surrender of the Austrian army. This means the Russian army will have to engage with the French, which Andrei finds scary and exciting. Zherkov is a jerk to Mack and Andrei yells at him.

What do you think of Prince Andrei’s opposing reputations?

We meet:

* Kozlovsky, an adjutant and I think Andrei’s equal
* Mack, an Austrian general

**Chapter 4**

Nikolai Rostov is back! He’s the 20-year-old-ish son of Count Rostov. He’s been “foraging”, no idea what that means. He is merry AF when he gets home in the morning. Denisov gets home still drunk, having lost everything playing cards. (I wonder if he was at the same game Zherkov planned to join.)

Telyanin comes in and steals Denisov’s money. Rostov pursues him to a tavern, where he gets it back, but then, emotional (because Denisov has accused Rostov and threatened him?), he throws the purse at Telyanin and goes.

We meet:

* Captain Vaska Denisov, the squadron commander
* Bondarenko, a Ukrainian hussar
* Lavrushka, Denisov’s servant
* Lieutenant Telyanin, who everyone hates
* Little Rook, Rostov’s horse (but not the one he was out on all night?)

**Chapter 5**

Rostov has screwed up by demanding the money back in the company of other commanders, and the other men are urging him to apologize. Zherkov arrives and tells them they have to march the next day. Turns out someone (Mack?) made a complaint about Zherkov being a jerk to Mack and now Zherkov is back in the regiment.

We meet:

* Staff Captain Kirsten
* Bogdanych, the regimental commander who called Rostov a liar

**Chapter 6**

They have marked on a town on the Danube and the officers are eating pies and casually discussing how they’d like to rape some convent nuns! How delightful! Also, there’s a battle going on.

My favorite part of the whole book so far: “Look, our infantrymen have already gotten in there. Over there in the little meadow beyond the village, three of them are dragging something. They’ll ransack that castle,” he said with obvious approval."
bookclub,"Hey everyone! How are you guys doing? Holding up okay?

So, Chapter IX. Let’s talk about this.

First it has red font that is strikethrough, slightly annoying but sure, I can handle that. Then that blue box appears, right, okay. Turn the page - hold up. What. Is. Going. On.

How did you feel about this chapter? I thought it felt like a literal maze. @SlyHatchet on Discord called it a labyrinth. Did you end up turning the book 360degrees, flipping backwards and forwards, like I did? I also used a pocket mirror to make sure I wasn’t missing any of the flipped text (paranoia seeping in), and also for footnote 184 on page 140. All of this made me frustrated at first, because my “normal” way of reading got severely disrupted, but by the end of it, I was in total awe. I gave myself a pat on the back for getting though what I will say is the most interesting and experimental thing I have ever read in my life. Props to you guys too!

/u/TooManyRappers mentioned in a previous thread that there could be a hidden message in the long footnote we saw before, does anyone think there’s more to just names and examples that we are being referenced to?

I enjoyed the formatting in Chapter X. It made me feel like I was on the expedition along with Navy, Tom and Reston. Tom’s Story in Chapter XI was a great little section that gave us a more personality to the character. He is slowly becoming my favourite. On that note, what do you think of the relationships between the characters? Some different dynamics there. And then there's more fun book-turning in Chapter XII.

Do you enjoy the little breaks from The Navidson Record and look forward to Johnny’s commentary? I was getting impatient and really wanted to get to the Ashley story. I thought that passage had a lot of emotion. (By the way, is anybody keeping count of all of these girls?!) 


Feel free to discuss theories relating to the formatting! I think it definitely has meaning in these chapters!

Can’t wait to hear your thoughts!"
bookclub,"I was going to quit the summaries after this, but they kind of help me, and also /u/wthisccchanel thinks I’m funny. So let’s keep going like this until I burn out or fall behind.

Out of curiosity… I know a few of you have read *Anna Karenina*. Is it this good?

Also, good job on posting outside these threads, you guys… you’re doing great with both this novel and *House of Leaves*. I’m upvoting each one. It’s good to see the sub busy with top-level posts, and remember, new ones ensure your thoughts and ideas are seen by everyone.

**Chapter 19**

Anna Mikhailovna (Boris’s mom) accompanies Pierre to his father’s house in the hopes of getting an audience with the dying count. (His father is the dying count, to be clear. I was not sure until this chapter.) She goes in without him, lol.

Pierre continues to be the character I most identify with: “…and that that evening, so as not to lose his head and do something foolish, he ought not to act according to his own reasoning, but give himself up entirely to the will of those who were guiding him.”

This jumped out at me as a vaguely Dickensian sort of dry humor: “[Vassily] went over to [Pierre], took his hand …, and pulled it down, as if testing whether it was well attached.”

**Chapter 20**

The dying count gets his last rites in an armchair (??). Mid-service, Prince Vassily and Catiche hang around by the bed, evidently looking for the will that Catiche told Vassily was under his pillow. Anna M is taking things over and no one has told her to leave (???). The count gets transfered to his bed and Pierre and Anna M are alone-ish with him, whereupon she directs him in how he should behave toward his dying father. The count requests to be turned on his side toward the wall, lol.

The moment with the arm at the very end is beautifully done… Pierre’s horror, the count’s amusement.

We meet:

* Princess Sophie
* Lorrain the French doctor (I don’t think we’ve seen him before?)

**Chapter 21**

Catiche can’t f’ing stand Anna M, and I don’t blame her, but Vassily makes her welcome, and then *she tries to take the portfolio from Catiche*. Holy shit, you guys. While they’re fighting over it, the count dies. Anna M, after telling Pierre that the count’s last wish was that Boris gets money, goes back to the Rostovs’ and lies about how the count died.

**Chapter 22**

We’re in the countryside near Moscow at Bald Hills, the Bolkonskys’ estate. Andrei and Elizaveta are about to visit. Princess Marya, Andrei’s sister, is being tutored by her father, who terrifies her and is a really bad teacher. She goes off to read a letter from her friend Julie Karagin. In my copy, both letters are in French, no joke, and repeated in English in a footnote. Also Marya is the trope of the pretty girl who thinks she’s ugly, sigh.

We hear that Pierre has been legitimized and inherited everything. Surprise! Also, he’s Count Bezukhov now. Anna M intends to get Marya married to Anatole.

Dumbass Marya thinks she’d rather be dirt poor than rich. She seems to not be 100% behind a marriage to Pierre despite liking him, but says she’ll do whatever her father wants her to.

What do you think of the conversation re: the mystical book and Marya’s rejection of it?

We meet:

* Nikolai Andreevich Bolkonsky
* Princess Marya/Marie Bolkonsky (not the same as Marya Karagin, who we encountered in Chapter 7)
* Mlle Bourienne, her companion
* Julie Karagin, her pen pal buddy

**Chapter 23**

Andrei and Lizaveta show up. Lizaveta is still being described as the “little princess” and still has a mustache, which the author implies is cute. Lizaveta and Marya fall all over each other even though they’ve only met like once before. There is crying. Andrei is understandably embarrassed.

He meets with his father, who only wants to talk about the war.

We meet:

* Tikhon, the servant

**Chapter 24**

The prince (older) makes obnoxious comments about Lise’s pregnancy and gives her unsolicited advice and is otherwise rude AF. Then he starts talking to Mikhail about the war.

Here’s another character using guile, but totally transparently… contrast with Anna Pavlovna from the very first chapter, with her mastery of conversation and ability to work a crowd.

We meet:

* Mikhail Ivanovich, the (older) prince’s architect (?)"
bookclub,"**I tried to summarise the events up to I.1.24 by character. Mostly it´s facts, but there are also some interpretations. I only included the things that seemed important to me. It helped me a lot to get a better overview and I hope it helps you guys too.**

*Besukhov Family*

**Pierre/Peter Besukhov**  
*son of the wealthy and well-known Count Besukhov  
*25 years old  
*tall, big, glasses  
* just came to Russia; was educated abroad  
* lives with Prince Vasili Kuragin  
* did not choose a profession yet  
* says he is content/satisfied with his life  
* does not know how to behave  
* but is honest, modest and bening  
* likes to talk about politics at first, but later seems less interested. He considers Napoleon a great leader; calls the french revolution a great achievement. When Peter  Shinshin, a cousin of Countess Nataly Rostova talks to him about politics at a party in Moscow, he isn´t interested.  
* Promised Prince Andrew Bolkonski to stop socialising with the Kuragins, but does it anyway, because he gave them his promise first that he would come. They got drunk as ususal and Dolokhov bet he could drink a bottle of rum sitting outside the window, which he indeed managed to do. Peter wanted to do the same thing, but they decided to leave. There was also a bear, which they later tied to a policemen, for which Peter and Kuragin were expelled from the city and Dolochow was degraded.  
* wants to befriend Prince Boris Drubetskoy after a weird encounter with him  

**Count Cyril  Besukhov**  
* dying/dead  
* wealthiest man of Russia  
* father of Peter

**Princess Catiche Besuchov**  
* niece of Cyril Besuchov  
* has 2 sisters: Olga and Sophie  
* all three are cousins of Peter, but don´t like him  → inheritance  
* after she hears from Prince Vasili Kuragin, that Count Cyril Besukhov has written a will in which he gave all his possessions to Peter, she blames Anna Drubetskaya for everything. She thinks, that Anna talked bad about her and her sisters.   
* With the help of Prince Vasili Kuragin she finds the will and want´s to talk to Count Cyril Besukhov about it in his last hours, but Anna Drubetskaya wouldn´t let her in and they start fighting over the will. Prince Vasili Kuragin says he takes care about it and walks in.   

*Kuragin Family*

* says he is happy to be freed from Peter when the Rostovs invite him over  
* convinces Princesse Catiche (Cathrine) Besukhov, that their inheritance is in danger, because Count Cyril Besukhov promised everything to Peter in a will, which is why they have to find it and destroy it.   
* After he and Catiche Besukhov found the will, he claims to speak with the dying Count Cyril Besukhov about it (Tolstoj doesn´t tell us what really happens in the room).

*Balkonski Family*  

**Princess Elizabeth Bolkonskaya/Lise**   
* wife of the young Prince Andrew  Bolkonski  
* says the war is dreadfull – probably because her husband is going to war and she has to leave the city to live on the countryside with her father in law Prince Nicholas Bolkonski. She does not want to go and argues with Peter and Andrew over it and says that Andrew is acting very egoistic.  
* she´s pregnant  
* helps Anna Scherer to make the marriage deal between her sister in law Mary Bolkonski and Anatole Kuragin  
* When she and her husband arrive at the countyside, she and her sister in law Mary kiss and cry, although they have only met each other once.

**Prince Andrew Balkonski**  
* Son of Nicholas  Balkonski

* everyone respects him  
* Considers Napoleon as a little French guy and nothing special – argues with his son, who has different views. 
* For him, all the contemparay military man have no idea what they are doing.  
* Lets his architect join the dining table, although his rank wouldn´t allow him this honour. But for some reason he makes an exception for the architect, although usually he is very strict with everything.

* doesn´t understand his lectures  
* is very religious  
* is a friend of Julie Karagina (not Kuragin!), who informs her in a letter, that Anna Michailowna planned to marry her to Anatole Kuragin. In the same letter she writes, that Peter was the sole heir and that Prince Vasili Kuragin has played a part in this intrigue.   
* Knew Peter already as a kid and says that he has a good heart.  
* Pitties Peters because such a forture is a constant temptation.   
* Wants to submit herself to the marriage, since it is a divine institution

bookclub,"Hi all

I finally got the next section done and up so if you would like to take a look that would be great. [War &amp; Peace Read Along part 2](https://youtu.be/CcKm85q4i7Y)"
bookclub,"[Family Tree Picture](https://i.imgur.com/BjtnhTa.png)

I saw a couple of different interpretations and some confusion regarding Count Kirill Bezukhov's family tree in the previous check in thread. This is my best understanding based on a few things. (Note that page numbers are all P&amp;V paperback translation.)

First Count Kirill is Pierre's father and the man dying in the early part of the book here. My copy (P&amp;V translation) writes in their character list that Pierre is his son and Katerina (nickname Catiche) is his niece. We know that there are a few nieces (all called princesses) to Count Kirill around. I think three based on Pierre's encounter with the three sisters in the drawing room in Volume 1, Part 1, Ch 8 (I.1.8, pg 52). Tolstoy doesn't name them then but from the description, I believe the oldest is Katerina. 

But we also know Prince Vassily is related to Count Kirill. But how is he? The best clue I've seen thus far is in I.1.18 (pg 72):

&gt;""Finally, it is necessary to think of my family, too"" Prince Vassily continued... ""You know, Catiche, that you three Mamontov sisters, and my wife as well - we are the count's only direct heirs."" 

What this says to me, and based on the relative ages of everyone, is that Prince Vassily's wife (Princess Kuragin) is the Count's sister. It's possible that Princess Kuragin is instead a niece or that Prince Vassily would be the Count's brother. However, Prince Vassily (and most likely his wife) are closer in age to the Count, and Princess Kuragin is not considered to be one of the Mamontov sisters. She could be the daughter of a different sister of the Count but I'm not sure since Vassily is around 50 and his children are around Pierre &amp; Katerina's age. Katerina does calls Prince Vassily her cousin though in 1.1.18 (pg 71) which supports that theory. 

I don't believe Prince Vassily is the Count's brother since then he wouldn't be a Kuragin or a Prince. The ""last name"" is also why I believe Katerina is a decendent of a sister of the Count not a brother. As a brother Prince Vassily would probably also have a greater claim to the Count's wealth than a sister potentially.

Hopefully I don't keep reading, and it falls apart immediately but this is my understanding so far. 

PS: Apologies for no accents. "

Hello everyone, and welcome to the wonderful world of House of Leaves.


What does everyone think of the narrative style? I want to trust Johnny, but at the same time, I feel like he's hiding something imperative. Do you think he’s an unreliable narrator? How about Zampano?


We had some good chapters, and some tough chapters. Any standout quotes? There is so much character building, and the pace of storytelling in both the essay and Johnny's commentary are complementary.


Any thoughts to why the word “house” is always in blue? ;)


I read in a forum that everything in the book is intentional- typos, spelling errors and all. Danielewski typed out the manuscript himself because he didn’t trust anyone else to do it. Have you noticed anything that you think might be symbolic?


From the Appendices we learn about Johnny's parents. Do you think that the events that occurred to his mom are what causes many important events that Johnny writes about? Does he have the same issues as her? Or do you think his writing are paralleling *The Navidson Record*, or maybe influenced by the book? Maybe both of thes reason? Maybe something else?


We'd love to hear your thoughts!"
bookclub,"Hello all!


Some of you may know, but /u/inclinedtothelie had to leave. As such I and /u/wthisccchannel are running this read.


With that said, it seems there is much confusion and many questions surrounding this read. So for now I would like to make this thread for simplifying the  process.


Feel free to ask any questions and suggest anything below, but make sure to use a spoiler tag if it is sensitive information!"
bookclub,"hey everyone, hope you're all doing well

i know the schedule specifically said to ignore the references to the appendices as they would be discussed in the end, but i felt compelled to make a thread about this one immediately after reading it (it is referenced in chapter V) because i was and still am heavily... touched by it, so i apologise for ""breaking the rules"" a lil bit here

so, did anyone else read it yet? what did you think?

personally i didn't care much for johnny until i read the letters. it was implied he had a tough childhood but only after reading those letters i was able to, say, relate to him and feel more empathy because it is similar to something that has happened in my family. i thought they were excellently written and were able to convey schizophrenic paranoia in a realistic manner, i was able to feel her pain and despair very clearly.

anyways, was anyone able to figure out page 633 so far? the may 8 1987 letter was easy to figure out as she literally gave us the code to break it, but i'm hoping further hidden messages will be revealed once i revisit it throughout the book

i'm sorry if this thread isn't ""permitted"" as it's skipping ahead in the discussion schedule"
bookclub,"Welcome back to Poem of the Week, where the interpretation's made up and the karma points don't matter! This week y'all have chosen ""Loveliest of Trees"" by A. E. Housman. Since the poem was published in 1896 and is definitely public domain, I have taken the liberty of including it in this post instead of linking it:

&amp;nbsp;

**Loveliest of Trees** by A. E. Housman

&gt; Loveliest of trees, the cherry now	 

&gt; Is hung with bloom along the bough,	 

&gt; And stands about the woodland ride	 

&gt; Wearing white for Eastertide.	 

&gt; &amp;nbsp;
  
&gt; Now, of my threescore years and ten,

&gt; Twenty will not come again,	 

&gt; And take from seventy springs a score,	 

&gt; It only leaves me fifty more.	 

&gt;&amp;nbsp;
  
&gt; And since to look at things in bloom	
 
&gt; Fifty springs are little room,

&gt; About the woodlands I will go	 

&gt; To see the cherry hung with snow.

&amp;nbsp;

[Here is a link to the first discussion where I outlined how to read a poem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/7h6o9s/poem_of_the_week_the_love_song_of_j_alfred/) And here are the basics in list form. Each number corresponds to a read-through of the poem:

1. Initial, no-pressure read-through
1. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem
1. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc. 
1. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?
1. What do you think the poem is about?

So what strikes me first is the simple logic the poet uses to discuss his mortality. It's almost indifferent. He straight up brings out math to justify something that's not logical but emotional. In fact, the poem is almost entirely logic and fact, but we (or at least I) get a very strong sense of emotion from its conclusion.

Also, check out the contrasts here, not only between logic and emotion (are they opposites, though? Is emotion always irrational?) -- spring is a common symbol of youth, and yet we see it hand in hand with someone who's only 20 but feels his time is running short.

What do you think of this poem? What stands out to you?"
bookclub,What are some films set in the world of War and Peace? Not necessarily adaptations of War and Peace on film but rather films that can be watched alongside War and Peace. Any ideas? 
bookclub,Okay. What the hell was the echo chapter supposed to get at? Is there some deep meaning that I'm missing? 
bookclub,"Welcome back to *War and Peace!*

As noted last time in exactly these words: Likely I won’t continue to write summaries that are this involved, but I find it’s helpful for the very beginning of a complex book. That article I linked last week says this: ""Many people find the first 100 pages dauntingly full of characters, and only then does it seem to smooth out and become lucid.” With that in mind, I intend to keep this up for the first 3-4 sections to clarify things for you and myself, and we’ll see how it goes after that.

**Chapter 7**

So there are at least two Annas in this book. The one this chapter starts with is not Party-Throwing Anna, it’s the Anna who asked Party-Throwing Anna to have her son moved to the guards. The count referenced is Count Rostov, who I don’t think we’ve met yet. Oh, also, we’re in Moscow. We’ve been in St. Petersberg up until now.

We found out that Pierre and company got really drunk that night and tied a cop to the bear and left them both swimming around in the river. Pierre was evidently banished to Moscow. AS I GATHER, he’s Anatole’s cousin, and their grandfather is probably dying. Anatole’s father Prince Vassily was supposed to inherit everything, but the grandfather loves Pierre so much that no one knows what his will looks like.

The “guest” the text keeps referring to is Marya Kagarin, I think.

Interesting quotes:

“‘What do you mean?’ asked the countess (Natalya Rostov), as if she did not know what the guest was talking about, though she had already heard the cause of Count Bezukhov’s distress a good fifteen times.”

There’s that quote above, and we also find out that Prince Vassily is coming to Moscow to “do some inspecting”, but the countess tells everyone that “it’s a pretext. He’s come, essentially, to see Count Kirill Vladimirovich, having learned that he was so poorly.”

I’m noticing a lot of difference between what people say and what they think, and it seems to me that the reason Pierre doesn’t fit in with the group at parties is that he’s an open book.

We meet:

* Count Ilya Andreevich Rostov
* Countess Natalya Rostov
* Dmitri Vassilievich (aka Mitenka?)
* Marya Lvovna Karagin
* Julia Kagarin (Marya’s daughter, not named until Chapter 9)


**Chapter 8**

There is a ruckus and a bunch of people appear, most of them children. They are having a super good time. Natasha has a doll, but when someone treats her like a child, she gets all mad about it. Boris is kind of a jerk to her and she’s kind of a jerk to him. Boris and his mom ditch the party.

We meet:

* Countess Natalya Ilyinichna Rostov (Natasha, the 13-year-old)
* Sofya Alexandrovna (the 15-year-old, Natasha’s cousin)
* Boris Drubetskoy (Anna’s son who got moved to the guards)
* Count Nikolai Ilyich Rostov (Natasha’s brother, a student Boris’s age)
* Count Pyotr Ilyich Rostov (Natasha’s younger brother, the little boy)


**Chapter 9**

Sonya the orphan Rostov cousin seems to have a thing for her cousin Nikolai, who’s following his friend Boris off to war. We find out that Natasha is in love with Boris because her mother gossips about it, lol.

Another quote about people not saying what they mean: “‘What to do?’ said the count, shrugging his shoulder and speaking jokingly about a matter that obviously cost him much grief.” We also see Sonya trying to hide her crush on Nikolai and later her anger, and Nikolai himself notes that he’s not good for anything but military service because, “I’m unable to hide my feelings.”

Also: “How crystal clear all these young ones’ secrets are!” notes Anna Mikhailovna, who I thought left at the end of the last chapter, but I guess she just moved rooms.

I thought this was interesting: “'Up to now, thank God, I’ve been a friend to my children and have enjoyed their full trust,’ said the countess, repeating the error of many parents who suppose that their children have no secrets from them.” Are we going to hear about these secrets later? Is this foreshadowing? She’s also certain that Nikolai won’t be as much of a wild child as Anatole and Pierre and company.

We meet:

* Countess Vera Ilyinichna Rostov (elder daughter, 17ish)


**Chapter 10**

Natasha hides in some plants and witnesses Sonya and Nikolai’s kiss. Natasha finds Boris and gets him to kiss her in the most awkward and realistically tweenish way possible. He promises to ask for her hand when she’s 17.


**Chapter 11**

Vera, the 17-year-old, does a lot of disdainful smiling and acting superior. Anna Mikhailovna complains to the countess about having no money and goes to ask Count Bezukhov for some cash. Count Rostov catches her on the way out and tells her to invite Pierre (Bezukhov’s son) to dinner. If you recall, a few chapters ago Count Rostov was slapping his knee about the cop and the bear in the river—everyone disdains Pierre except him.


**Chapter 12**

Anna Mikhailovna and Boris pay a visit to Count Bezukhov. The Count isn’t feeling well so Anna asks to see Prince Vassily, who is clearly put out by her arrival.

“The son noticed how deep grief suddenly appeared in his mother’s eyes and smiled slightly.” Lol. Everyone’s an actor!


**Chapter 13**

Flashback to Pierre’s super awkward arrival in Moscow. Flash forward and Boris is being a bit of a jerk to Pierre, but they come to an understanding. Anna Mikhailovich is hamming it up in front of Prince Vassily, and Boris asks her why she thinks the Count will leave them money.

Notice how in their conversation, Boris is making things awkward for Pierre, but “Pierre kept fearing that this officer would accidentally fall into a conversation awkward for himself.” I kind of love Pierre, he has zero guile. He doesn’t even seem to realize when someone is deliberately messing with him. Boris, on the other hand, has been trying to keep his mother from embarrassing him but is totally ready to make Pierre squirm. In fact, that entire conversation… they both have two completely different aims. It’s almost like each character is having a different conversation.

**Chapter 14**

Back at the Rostovs’, the countess asks the count for 700 rubles to equip Boris with his uniform. (Interesting that both the musketeers in 3M and these dudes have to buy their own uniforms. Is it that way in the modern American military? Don’t they get a uniform allowance?) The countess gives Anna the money and they cry together.

**Chapter 15**

There is smoking and discussion. We discover Berg, another apparently guileless character. Closer to dinner, *le terrible dragon* shows up and embarrasses Pierre. The chapter ends with a passage describing all the guests and interactions among them.

Also, we get this quote: “Pierre arrived just before dinner and sat awkwardly in the middle of the drawing room, in the first armchair he happened upon, getting in everyone’s way.” I love Pierre, he’s precious.

We meet:

* Marya Dmitrievna Akhrosimov, “le terrible dragon”
* Pyotr Nikolaevich Shinshin, the cousin of Countess Natalya Rostov
* Lieutenant Alphonse/Adolf Karlovich/Karlych Berg

**Chapter 16**

The talk turns to politics. Natasha shows that she shouldn’t be allowed in polite company.

Natasha’s childishness and rudeness is heavily contrasted with the adults’ manners. I think so far we’ve seen a few people with a deficit of quiet, demure politeness: Marya Dmitrievna’s brusque rudeness, Pierre and Berg’s naivete, and Natasha’s obnoxiousness.

**Chapter 17**

Natasha goes to look for Sonya, who is crying, and Natasha starts to cry too, lol. Turns out Vera has been a jerk to Sonya. Natasha comforts her and is super nice about it. It looks like Natasha has a little crush on Pierre now, too. The count dances with Marya Dmitrievna.

**Chapter 18**

While everyone parties, Count Bezukhov has another stroke. There’s lots of talk about last rites/extreme unction, which everyone is worried about.

Vassily goes into a room to talk to Catiche, who is Count Bezukhov’s niece, but now I’m unclear on which Count Bezukhov is dying. It’s Kirill, right? So Pierre is her illegitimate half brother. Vassily and Catiche talk about inheritance, and once he manages to convince her that their inheritance is in trouble, she tells him where it is.

We meet:

* Princess Katerina/Catiche Semyonovna Bezukov"
bookclub,"I like the intensity of the writing. It has an adrenaline to it and a noir sensibility. A few times I was slowed down by some meta moments and some hammy dad joke level puns, but overall I'm finding myself increasingly engaged at page 70 or so.

Anyone?"
bookclub,"Hello! This might seem a bit strange of a question, but I was wondering if the Kuragins (Anatole, Helene, Vassily) and the Karagins (Julie) were related, and if so, how. 

I suspect that there will be many characters like this but can’t seem to find anything more than a simple family tree chart for the book.

Thank you!"
bookclub,"The typical Russian name is in three parts: 

•	*Christian name*, e.g. **Anna**; 

•	‘*patronymic*’ based on the father’s Christian name, e.g. **Mikhailovna**; 

•	*surname*, e.g. **Drubetskáya**. 

In aristocratic circles, there is often also a *title*, e.g. **Princess**. (It was perfectly possible for a princess, like Anna Mikhailovna, to be poor. A title is not always a sign of current status.)

So **Princess Anna Mikhailovna Drubetskáya** must be Anna, the daughter of **Mikhail** and the wife of **Prince Drubetsky**. (Note: these are the female versions of patronymic and surname. The male versions would be Mikhail***ovich*** and Drubet***sky***.)

The usual form in polite conversation is made up of the first two, **Christian name** and **patronymic**. So the hostess of the soiree, **Anna Pávlovna Schérer**, is always called (by the narrator as well as everybody else) **Anna Pávlovna**. However, there are variants, and **nicknames** are often in the most fashionable language, French. So in her invitation, Anna Pávlovna calls herself ‘**Annette Schérer**,’ which is how a Frenchwoman would write her name. 

Examples so far:

**Prince Vasíli Kurágin**, the man that Anna Pávlovna is talking to at the start, is usually simply ‘***Prince***’.

Andrei, full name **Andrei Bolkónski**, is usually addressed as ‘***Prince Andrei***’ or simply ‘***Prince***’.

**Princess Maria Bolkónskaya** (Mary in some translations) is mentioned, and she turns out to be Andrei Bolkónski’s sister. Her surname is the female variant.

There is another ‘***Princess Bolkónskaya***,’ almost always referred to as the ‘little princess,’ who is Andrei’s wife. A wife takes on her husband’s title when they marry.

***Princess Hélène*** is Prince Vasili’s daughter, so her surname (which is never used) would be Kurág***ina***.

Pierre, introduced as ‘an illegitimate son of Count Bezúkhov,’ is only ever called ***Pierre***.

Confused? You get used to it – I know, because I’ve read a few other Russian novels in translation. But remember that even the narrator might use different forms to refer to the same character. On the same page, the narrator calls Andrei both ‘***Bolkónski***’ and ‘***Prince Andrei.***’ The woman begging a favour of Prince Vasili is usually ‘***Anna Mikhailovna***’, but she is also referred to as ‘***Princess Drubetskáya***.’

Just be ready for it."
bookclub,"Hey everybody! While reading through War and Peace it occurred to me that some people might have some questions about why Russians do certain things, or strange Russian words or things like that, especially if you've never read Russian Lit before. So I'm creating this thread for any questions of this sort.

I'm not Russian, but I know quite a bit about both the language and the culture, and have a bunch of friends who are Russian that I can forward questions to if I don't know the answer."
bookclub,"Why does Tolstoy open his novel like this? The soiree that makes up the first few chapters is full of what seems to be the worn-out, seen-it-all-before Petersburg aristocracy and there are no heroes. Even the young characters, who ought to be more attractive, are flawed. Andrei seems to be a bored, sexist snob – and his friend, the likeable Pierre, seems to have been born yesterday. He is young (20, I think) and so self-indulgent he’s already fat. 

Prince Vasili is kind of my anti-hero favourite so far. Every minute of any social engagement is dictated by form, but he knows what it takes to keep your head above water in this environment. At the social level, he knows that judgments of character and behaviour are based only on how comfortable everyone else in the room can be made to feel. So he, like all the men at the soiree, is gallant, polite, and acts according to formulas of correct behaviour. (There’s that running joke to do with how everyone greets Anna Pavlovna’s aged aunt in precisely the same way.) Meanwhile the women are… what, exactly? It seems that according to the rules of this society, they can be good hostesses like Anna Pavlovna – i.e. she knows how to bring people together to have a comfortable time with people they know – or they can be ornamental, like the pretty young wife Andrei finds so dull.

Tolstoy makes it clear that it’s all a pointless game. We meet Anna Mikhaylovna who, like Vasili, knows exactly what needs to be done in order to survive in the jungle that is upper class life in 1805. This game isn’t pointless to the players, because theirs is a comfortable life and they want to keep it. What she is doing is begging a favour of Prince Vasili that he doesn’t want to do for her. She wants him to pull strings to get her son Boris into the Guards, but Vasili is stalling: he’s been in the game long enough to know that ‘Influence in society… is a capital which has to be economised if it is to last.’ He can pull strings, but he can’t keep on doing it too much. 

But she’s a match for him, and eventually he relents. Is it because, as she reminds him, her father had once pulled strings for him in exactly the same way? (This is obviously how people get into positions of power in this world. It has nothing to do with merit.) She reminds him ‘he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career….’ He doesn’t really care. But she is ‘one of those women – mostly mothers’ who just won’t give up. She’ll go on and on at him and even, possibly, make a scene. Ah. ‘This last consideration moved him.’ The suave, omniscient narrator can see beneath the surface of these polite exchanges, and lets us know exactly how things really work. 

As for Pierre…. He has no idea that he’s in the game, or even that there is a game at all. He arrives at the soiree – and I’m beginning to realise how much mileage Tolstoy is getting out of this first episode – and he’s clueless about any of the rules. He’s almost a Candide, having only recently returning from being educated in France, and he expects everybody to be as open as he is. So he talks about Napoleon as if he’s to be taken seriously, which nobody else in the room wants to do. He’s committed the biggest possible faux pas, because Petersburg society simply wants to make Napoleon – or ‘Buonaparte’ – a figure of fun. They have no idea what Napoleon is capable of, thinking that he is no match for their mockery – and no match for their beloved ‘Emperor’. Pierre might not have a clue, but neither do they. Tolstoy’s readers in the 1860s knew what a shock these people will soon be in for. There would have been a few readers still alive who remembered what Napoleon did next, and even those who weren’t could see through this nonsense as easily as we can."
bookclub,"Hi all, 
I have made a [video](https://youtu.be/pEDTcuTBgM0) of my thoughts for this read along on booktube. I was going to post it in the dedicated thread but Surf_Wax who is running this was asking for new threads, and I have never made my own thread so I thought I would give it a go.

I also what to write a few quick notes;
I am reading the Gutenberg version of War &amp; Peace on my Kindle which has different chapter structures to the one posted by Surf_Wax. The first section was chapters 1-9 and section 2 is chapters 10-21

As far as my thought of on the book; this is my 2nd read through of W&amp;P and I don't really remember much from that and I have found that mapping the characters and talking about them seems to be helping.
At the moment I am really like the characters Anna Povlovna and Pierre but we shall see where that goes.

I'm hoping that I will be able to do a video for each section but we will see as I have just started my booktube channel.

While I don't miss forced and accelerated reading from high school, I definitely miss the lectures and guided discussion on literary terms, themes, etc. I like to study along with classics as I read them as much as possible and get context for the work from a historical and literary perspective. 

For Lord of the Rings, I've found a podcast that was a series of recorded lectures that was taught every few chapters. I'm curious if anyone has seen something similar for War &amp; Peace? I've read the SparkNotes alongside in the past but it can be a little spoilery at times. Thanks!"

**Before we get going, I want to say, please, feel free to make top-level posts of your own in /r/bookclub! We’re trying to encourage people to take discussion out of the scheduled posts and make spontaneous posts of their own. They don’t have to be good, either.

Anything goes, as long as it’s about a current or past selection.**

Here we go:

**Chapter 1**

Tolstoy kind of drops us into the action here. It’s 1805ish and Napoleon is on Russia’s doorstep, but the St. Petersburg upper class is still throwing parties, talking politics, and arranging advantageous marriages. Anna Pavlovna, who is somewhat highly-placed in Russian society but doesn’t seem to be a royal, is in her drawing room, talking with Prince Vasily at the very beginning of her evening party.

Said about him, briefly: “…said the prince, uttering out of habit, like a wound-up clock, things that he did not even wish people to believe.”

And her: “…and she sometimes became enthusiastic even when she had no wish to, so as not to deceive the expectations of people who knew her.”

Interesting how we’re told right off that these people will act differently than they feel in social situations. Something to look out for, maybe?

We meet:

* Anna/Annette Pavlovna
* Prince Vasily Kuragin


**Chapter 2**

The party begins in earnest, and Anna makes the genius move of scraping her new guests off on her boring aunt so she can go to greet others… but it doesn’t work on Pierre, who seems too socially inept to play along. When she gets rid of him, we see how skilled she is; she goes around fine-tuning the party so as to “set the conversation machine running evenly and properly again.” Damn… I can’t even talk straight half the time, lol.

Notice she has a “fear"" surrounding Pierre. Is this a fear for or of him? Does she find him intimidating, or is she afraid of vicarious embarrassment?

I get the sense that we’re being introduced to Tolstoy’s enormous cast of characters here, and all or most of these people are going to be important later.

We meet:

* Helene Kuragin, Prince Vasily’s daughter
* Elizaveta/Lise Bolkonsky (the little princess)
* Pierre Bezukhov


**Chapter 3**

Mortemart tells a “charming” story about how Napoleon killed someone who didn’t kill him first. Anna chases after Pierre, who needs more babysitting after she perceives his conversation with the abbot is headed for disaster. Prince Andrei appears and is sick and bored of everyone, and Vassily asks Anna to educate Pierre for him.

What exactly is Pierre doing wrong? I can’t figure it out, but I think his “education” is going to play a big part in the story.

We meet:

* Mortemart
* Prince Ippolit
* Prince Andrei Bolkonsky


**Chapter 4**

Princess Drubetskoy corners Vassily and gets him to try to move her son to a different area of the military than where he is now. Mortemart changes the subject with this lovely little line from Tolstoy: “…with the air of a man who does not listen to others, but, in matters known better to him than to anyone else, follows only the train of his own thoughts….” This harkens back to Mrs. Norris in *Mansfield Park* for me, because we all know and are annoyed by *one of those*. He goes on to say that Napoleon’s retention of the throne will harm French society, and then corrects himself to say, “good society”.

European history has never been my strong suit, but [I found this Reddit comment with citations on why French was spoken in Russian high society](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5f6p6i/why_did_the_russian_aristocracy_speak_mainly/) and why they revered France culture so much.

Pierre says something defensive of Napoleon that isn’t well-received, and Andrei comes to his aid.

What do we think of Pierre? Is he being a complete ass, or do these stuffy aristocrats need to loosen the hell up? Anyone else seeing themselves in the poor guy, having political discussions over the holidays?

And why do you think the aristocrats think what they do about Napoleon? Is it because Russia is allied with England and Austria against France, or is there another reason?

We meet:

* Princess Anna Mikhailovna Drubetskoy


**Chapter 5**

The guests leave. There are a number of curious little exchanges — Anna and Pierre, Anna and Lise, Lise and Ippolit’s awkward encounter, the viscount and Ippolit. Why do you think Prince Andrei asks Ippolit in *Russian* to get out of the way? Does Ippolit have a thing for Lise? Look at all of the little relationships Tolstoy is setting up.

**Chapter 6**

Lise and Andrei have an argument in front of Pierre about Andrei going to the war. Andrei sends Pierre home after making him promise not to visit Kuragin’s, but Pierre goes anyway, gets drunk, and does something stupid to try to fit in with the crowd.

We meet:

* Prince Anatole Kuragin
* Stevens, a random Englishman
* Yakov, some rando (?)
* Dolokhov, Anatole’s roommate
* Bruin the bear"
bookclub,"I've been wanting to read *War and Peace* since listening to the album ""Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812."" 

I'm really enjoying it so far, but I suspect it might be easy to lose track of the characters. The musical's first song keeps popping into my head and helps me keep the characters straight, so I thought I would share for anyone who is interested.

[Prologue](https://youtu.be/STzIIYf3iS0)"
bookclub,"Hey 3M readers! Can you believe that we’ve finally arrived at the end of *The Three Musketeers*? Warning: If you haven’t read chapters 65 – 68, there are **SPOILERS** ahead.

While a search party is sent looking for Milady, Athos seeks out a mysterious stranger. The stranger in the red cloak joins the Musketeers in journeying to the inn at Armentieres where Milady is hiding. They catch her as she’s about to cross the river and escape. The men swiftly bring her to trial, naming all of the people whose death she is responsible. 

When Athos mentions the fleur-de-lis on Milady’s shoulder, she challenges him to prove it. This is when the mysterious stranger steps forward and is revealed to be the Executioner of Lille who shares his own vile experience with Milady. Lorde de Winter and the Musketeers choose death for Milady’s punishment. She pleads and tries her usual manipulative tricks, but is dragged off and beheaded.

The Musketeers wipe their hands of that hot mess and, miraculously not having exceeded the leave granted by M. de Treville, return to Paris to get back to the business of war. But things are pretty much over due to the Duke of Buckingham’s assasination.

Shortly afterwards, Count Rochefort comes to arrest D’artagnan on behalf of the Cardinal. When the Cardinal begins his accusation, D’artagnan gives him the whole history of Milady’s involvement in the very crimes of which he is accused. As one last Hail Mary, he produces the pardon Athos stole from Milady written in the Cardinal’s hands.The Cardinal accepts what D’artagnan has told him and even promotes him to a lieutenant Musketeer. A predictable twist I find irritating because the Cardinal has favoured D’artagnan throughout the whole book when the kid is really just a dunderhead IMHO.

In the epilogue, we get a quick summary of how the lives of the Musketeers change over the years. D’artagnan becomes a great leader (although I can’t picture how that hothead could unless the Cardinal paved the way) and the other Musketeers and their servants go their separate ways.

The end of their tight unit makes D’artagnan emotional, but the ever wise Athos reminds him, “You are young ... and your bitter recollections have time to change themselves into sweet remembrances.” 

**Questions**

*The Three Musketeers* began with a positive, adventurous tone, but by the end, the story feels solemn and a little bit sad. Why do you think Dumas chose not to have a happy ending?

Overall, did you like *The Three Musketeers*? What didn’t you like? Do you plan to read the next book in the series?

**Summary**

I didn’t have the kind of reading experience I anticipated with *The Three Musketeers*. While I could appreciate the adventure-filled plot and the characters, I was frequently bored. Again, I think I may be too old for the story or possibly even too *familiar* with the story. On a side note, I watched the 2011 movie and to say they changed the story would be an understatement. Although I loved the actors, it was this bizarre cloak and dagger, flying pirate ship disaster of a plot. Also D’artagnan was still an annoying idiot.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts on *The Three Musketeers*! Hope you enjoyed reading along with me."
bookclub,"So now that I've completely biffed ""The Waste Land"", let's come back to something a little easier. Robert Burns was a prolific songwriter in Scotland in the 18th century, and he's often called Scotland's Shakespeare. He's the source (whether he's the author is sometimes debatable) of a number of songs and poems you might recognize, including ""Auld Lang Syne"", which has been tied to New Year's celebrations for ages.

I'm posting this in Burns's original Scots, and then a translation in English in italics where I think it might be needed. Scots is an English dialect, but some of the vocabulary is different. If you want to follow along with a guy dressed as Rabbie Burns singing the song in Scots, [here you go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMwPXEmioh8), lol.

**Auld Lang Syne by Robert Burns**

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Should auld acquaintance be forgot, *(Should old acquaintance be forgot)*

&gt; And never brought to mind? 

&gt; Should auld acquaintance be forgot, 

&gt; And auld lang syne! *(And old times)*

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; Chorus:

&gt; For auld lang syne,

For reference, here's our five-step guide to poem interpretation.

1. Initial, no-pressure read-through
1. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem
1. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc. 
1. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?
1. What do you think the poem is about?

""Auld Lang Syne"" is pretty straightforward once you know what you're singing, which is the hard part. It's a song/poem about remembering old times. It starts out with a question: should the narrator just forget the old times, or do they deserve to be remembered? He addresses his friend, whom he's known for years, running around the hills and swimming in the streams, and at the end of these remembrances he seems to conclude that the old times and this friendship are worth retaining.

Here are my discussion questions for you:

* Is this a genuine question he seems to be asking here, or is he in fact making an argument instead?
* How do you think it relates to the New Year?
* Do you agree with my interpretation? Is there anything you want to add about the poem -- anything that catches your eye, bits you want to talk about?

Happy New Year, everyone!"
bookclub,"Alright, guys. Thanks to the help of /u/surf_wax and @prole_ and @wthisccchanel on Discord, I think we've finally got a schedule! 

This is a flexible schedule, and we will be powering through this work. It looks daunting, but I really think we can do it all together. 

* Jan. 1 - Jan 7 -- Intro and Chapters 1-8- (Intro + Pages 1-107)
* Jan 8 - Jan 12 -- Chapters 9-12 (Pages 108-312) (It looks like a lot, but it's not!)
* Jan 13 - Jan 20 -- Chapters 13-20 (Pages 313-422) 
* Jan 21 - Jan 24 -- Chapters 21-23 (Pages 423 - 528)
* Jan 25 - 31 -- Exhibits and Appendices 1-3 (Pages 529-662)

**Note:** We are leaving the appendices to the end, even though they are referenced throughout the story, due to a suggestion from /u/THE_MAGIC_OF_REALITY, who has read the book. They say these sections don't affect the flow of the story, but can add to it, even if read at the end. If you want to check them as you go, feel free, tough. We will just be discussing them at the end.

If at any time you want to make a comment or ask a question or anything, feel free to do so. This is just a way to set a pace for the book. It looks intimidating, but we can do this! 

/u/ConorBrennan and /u/wthisccchanel will be helping execute the schedule, so do not be surprised to see posts by all of us regarding this. 

Happy reading! "
bookclub,"Okay, full disclosure, I don't feel qualified to comment on this one, simply because [look at this](http://www.bernytan.com/art/a-visual-guide-to-references-in-ts-eliots-the-waste-land-1922/). Look at it! Those are all the references in this poem. Eliot was some kind of... I don't know what, because my head is broken just looking at it and I have things to do today.

Let's look at the poem. The original version I linked didn't have the epigraph; [this one does](http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html), and the [English translation is here](https://imgur.com/a/gHFfi) (credit to /u/Hongkie for both, plus that earlier link). This time we're going to do something different. Instead of being all ambitious thinking we're going to figure out the poem, let's take a more casual approach and do one or more of the following:

* Pick apart a favorite section
* Talk about some sections in the context of their references
* Read a CliffsNotes-style reference (Shmoop and SparkNotes are pretty good) and come in and talk about what you see -- it's okay that you didn't 100% come up with it on your own, this poem is the subject of entire university courses, it's a little hard.

Any little observation is welcome. Talk to me! I'm here all weekend."
bookclub,"Hi 3M readers! Sorry for the late post, but I’ve been slayed by the flu and can’t seem to shake it. Lots of action in these chapters and you can feel that everything is going to come to an epic finale. Warning: If you haven’t read chapters 57 – 64, there are **SPOILERS** ahead.

Milady casts a spell over Felton, and not afraid of going to extremes, stabs herself at one last attempt to win Felton’s devotion. Suspicious, Lorde de Winter sends Felton away, but he returns and breaks Milady out of prison. They sail to Portsmouth where the Duke of Buckingham is preparing his ships to sail for La Rochelle.  

Felton manages to get an audience with Buckingham and tries to convince the Duke to sign an order freeing Milady. The Duke refuses repeatedly. When his servant enters the room to announce a message has arrived from France, Felton uses the distraction to stab Buckingham fatally. He tries to escape, but runs into Lorde de Winter and is seized. The message is from the Queen of France. She begs Buckingham to call off his campaign against France and by the way, she still loves him. Buckingham dies giddy with love.

Meanwhile, the Musketeers are anxious to rescue Mme Bonacieux since she’s only been missing for a millions years. Also they heard Milady will be sent to the same convent. M. de Treville gives them permission to leave because it’s not like there’s a war going on or anything. Along the way the Musketeers encounter Count Rochefort, but D’artagnan again fails to capture him. However, Rochefort drops a note with town of Armentieres written on it.

Milady arrives at the convent and charms Mme Bonacieux into believing she is a friend of D’artagnan. Trusting as always, Mme Bonacieux shows her a letter from Madame de Chevreuse saying that D’artagnan is coming to rescue her. You can imagine the deadly glee sparkling in Milady’s eyes. Count Rochefort arrives and Milady asks him to arrange a carriage to take her and Mme Bonacieux to Armentieres. As they are preparing for the carriage, the Musketeers arrive.  

Milady tells Mme Bonacieux that the commotion is the arrival of the Cardinal’s men. This backfires, as Mme Bonacieux becomes too frigthened to get into the carriage. Sickened by her fear, Milady gives her a poisoned glass of wine and escapes. The Musketeers find Mme Bonacieux, but it’s too late and she dies in D’artagnan’s arms. Lorde de Winter arrives and Athos reveals that he is Milady’s first husband. The two men agree to hunt the villainess down.

**Questions**

In real life, the Duke of Buckingham was in fact assassinated by a naval lieutenant named John Felton. In addition, the battle at La Rochelle really took place. What do you think of Dumas weaving fact and fiction together in the story?

Romantic love is a big deal in the Musketeer world. Yet both Buckingham and Mme Bonacieux both die tragically. Do their deaths elevate the romance in the story? Does this make the story more interesting or are you just going meh?

We’re so close to the end of *The Three Musketeers*. Happy reading! "
bookclub,"EDIT: Whoops, I wasn't supposed to post this until the 31st. Well, here it is early!

We should be finishing up with *The Left Hand of Darkness* today, and I'm not sure what to say about it. It took me by surprise the first time I read it, and nothing has changed in this rereading: the profundity, the journey over the ice, Estraven's sacrifice. Here are some questions from my first post that I want to revisit:

* There are some pretty complex politics going on on Winter. What's your understanding of them so far?
* Does gender tie into politics? Do you think the author could have written this story without the gender?
* Do you think it's important that Genly is male? How does that affect his interactions with the Gethenians? Do you think it'd be different if he was female?

There's a moment I want to talk about, in Chapter 16, which has always been jarring to me. Estraven asks Genly about women. Until that point, I always seem to forget that despite the presence of temporarily-female-gendered characters, there are no *women* in the story. (Interesting that LHoD doesn't pass the Bechdel Test.) Being jarred back to reality during Genly's explanation of women was like coming out of a particularly immersive movie, where everyone is equal -- but as Genly points out, everyone is not. ""I suppose the most important thing, the heaviest single factor in one's life, is whether one's born male or female. ... It's extremely hard to separate the innate differences from the learned ones.""

There are books like Ben Winters's *Last Policeman* series, where you're living with the low-grade horror that the world is going to end, and suddenly it's your train stop and you put the book away and everything is okay again. I felt the opposite here: I got to live in a book where, briefly, everyone was the same, and then got jerked back to reality and promptly had gender differences shoved in my face again. Estraven says in this section, ""Are they mentally inferior?"" Because even Genly's explanation of women implies that, because it's informed by a culture that says we are.

On a new topic, I'm deeply interested in where you think the story is going to go after the end of the novel. How will Terran culture change Winter?

What did you think of the end of the book?"

* Tolstoy's assertions and contradictions
* Character growth

bookclub,"Hey 3M readers! Hope you enjoyed the holidays and had a chance to sneak in some reading. Warning: If you haven’t read chapters 49 – 56, there could be **SPOILERS** ahead.

Milady returns to England on the Cardinal’s orders, but she is captured by Lorde de Winter and jailed. Meanwhile, the Cardinal is anxiously waiting to hear from her while the siege at La Rochelle continues. To kill some time, the Cardinal tries to convince the La Rochellians to revolt, but Buckingham arrives and inspires the people to continue the fight. Dang! The Cardinal is losing on all fronts.

Depressed, the Cardinal takes a walk on the beach and comes across the Musketeers talking about a letter. He tries to eavesdrop on their conversation, but Grimaud catches him. Athos is annoyed by his appearance and a few insults later the Cardinal decides its best to hightail it.

The letter is from Mme de Chevreuse informing the Musketeers of Mme Bonacieux’s whereabouts. Once again, the Musketeers vow to rescue the poor woman. At this stage, Mme Bonacieux has probably turned to the dark side. I know I would.

Back in prison, time is running out for Milady because Lorde de Winter is planning to banish her. The villainess tries all sorts of things to trick her jailer, John Felton. Milady uses her beauty and intelligence to manipulate Felton and make him fall in love with her. The good ol’ maiden needing rescue ruse never fails! Finally, she turns him against Lorde de Winter, convincing him that he should help her.

**Questions**

A majority of these chapters focused on Milady’s seduction of John Felton. That’s a lot of chapters we spend away from the Musketeers. While interesting, I found this focus on her really slowed down the story. What did you think?

Characters in *The Three Musketeers* frequently resort to manipulating feelings to get what they want. For example: Milady with John Felton, D’artagnan with Kitty, and Porthos with Mme Coquenard. Not so much Milady, but for me, this behavior taints the redeeming qualities of the Musketeers and those particular characters seem less like heroes to me. Am I the only one who feels this way?

As for the Cardinal, he’s having a bad week. Nothing seems to be going his way. In these chapters, he’s nothing like the stereotypical ‘evil villain’. He’s depressed and vulnerable, and the Musketeers get the better of him. I know he’s supposedly the Bad Guy, but then why does Dumas write scenes like the one on the beach where he seems at a complete loss? What do you think of villains who don't have it all figured out?

Happy reading!"
bookclub,"Here are our January poems! All of them (and no others) received five votes. Originally I said we were doing four, because there were four Saturdays in January, but since one of our poems lends itself particularly well to an off date, we'll just do them all.

I'll put up ""Auld Lang Syne"" on the 31st so you know what you're singing later that night. It doesn't matter what day you participate in the discussion."
bookclub,"*War and Peace* is divided into four books and an epilogue, and each book (also book IV + the epilogue) is roughly the same length, so we will do one book per month and tag the epilogue on at the end of April.

I divided them further by having two regular check-in/scheduled dates per week and dividing the number of pages in my edition by the number of dates, then finding the chapter that starts closest to each interval. I dog-eared my copy and it looks pretty even. It's roughly 35-40 pages per date, so about 70-80 pages a week, or around 10-12 pages daily.

In the schedule below, the Roman numbers stand for the book; the first number for the part (each book is divided into parts), and the second number for the chapter, so IV.3.6 means Book 4, Part 3, Chapter 6. (E means Epilogue.) Note that we are reading *through* the second chapter listing for each date, so for our first date on January 3, we will be reading up until Book 1, Part 1, Chapter 7.

EDIT: Because not every book is constructed like mine, I have added a portion of each beginning sentence to the schedule to help you find your place. Thanks to /u/awosanma for bringing it to my attention.

By the way, I mentioned this to someone in the intro thread earlier, and I want to extend it to everyone. It will probably be very helpful to have a notebook or a text file handy when you're reading. W&amp;P has lots of characters, and our experience with *Crime and Punishment* makes me think that Tolstoy will refer to them using various names, making it difficult to keep them straight. My guess is that's going to be our biggest hurdle here. I would recommend taking notes of all the names used for particular characters and where each character first appears, to help you keep them straight. Maybe I can create and edit a post to keep track of them here.

See you in about a week and a half! I can't wait."
bookclub,"Welcome to another Poem of the Week! Also, a reminder to [vote on January poems](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/7kg1rg/poem_of_the_week_voting_for_january/). You have about 24 hours before the winners are announced!

This week we are doing [""Sailing to Byzantium""](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43291/sailing-to-byzantium) by William Butler Yeats. I am only linking the poem and not reproducing it here because it is not yet out of copyright.

[Here is a link to the first discussion where I outlined how to read a poem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/7h6o9s/poem_of_the_week_the_love_song_of_j_alfred/) And here are the basics in list form. Each number corresponds to a read-through of the poem:

1. Initial, no-pressure read-through
1. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem
1. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc. (This one is an [ottava rima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottava_rima).)
1. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?
1. What do you think the poem is about?

So... I think this poem is about death and the afterlife. I'm reaching here, though. This one isn't easy, and I don't want to look at any poetry analysis sites until I've got a good hypothesis.

Stanza by stanza:

**I**

We learn that ""that"" is no country for old men, and he goes on to describe a Circle of Life kind of paradise with birth and death, which is presumably not where old men should be lingering. I'm curious about the last two lines, which I can't quite figure out.

**II**

The focus moves from the paradise to the old man himself, the coat on a stick (I love this image). The old man appears to be the narrator, who has come from paradise to the ""holy city of Byzantium"". An aside, Byzantium was an ancient city which stands on the Bosphorus river, where Istanbul is now, and it was a major trading port between the Black Sea and Europe. I am not sure what makes it holy, but I think in the context of the poem it stands for death, which every religion has something to say about.

**III**

At this point, the narrator asks that the sages, who are standing in holy fire, consume his heart, which is ""sick with desire"" and ""fastened to a dying animal"" (his body?). I think this means that he's arrived at death's door (Byzantium) and he's asking for the freedom of death (""gather me into the artifice of eternity""). But look at the language there: *artifice*. What does that mean? We get the word ""artificial"" from it -- it means a trick or conceit.

**IV**

""Once out of nature"" (dead), he's not going to assume any organic form; one could argue that hammered gold is artificial. This is where I get really lost. Who's the drowsy Emperor? God? And what about the last lines? Who are the lords and ladies? Could this be a metaphor for what being a poet is -- the ability to ""sing"" to others, after death, ""of what is past, or passing, or to come""? Is this artificial eternity -- oblivion for the author, but eternity for his works?

We picked, again, something that is really not easy! Tell me what you think of it! What's your interpretation? Did you notice anything about the meter, which we discussed last week? What about the parts that are difficult to parse? Why Byzantium? Talk to me!"
bookclub,"So… y’all chose *War and Peace* for our January read, and let me tell you, you do not want to read this thing in a month. It’s around 587K words, depending on the translation; for reference, *Three Musketeers* was just under 200K and *Don Quixote*, which took us months, was a touch north of 400K. I think trying to finish W&amp;P by January 31 may actually kill us.

But fear not! /u/inclinedtothelie is allowing me to treat it as a Big Read. We’re going to be spreading it out over 3-4 months, starting in January. I will get my copy on Saturday and come up with a schedule this weekend.

As far as translations go, I am hearing recommendations for the Pevear and Volokhnosky (P&amp;V) translation, which is currently about $13 on Amazon. I’m reading Pevear’s *Three Musketeers* now, and he made *Dead Souls* extremely readable. Some people seem annoyed that the French portions are left in French and translated in footnotes, though — do check out the “Look inside” on Amazon before you commit. That said, whichever translation you choose is absolutely fine for our purposes, including the one available on Project Gutenberg.

So now that you know what the plan is, I want to hear from you. Tell me a little about yourself! Did you ever think you'd be tackling this book? Are you eager to get started? I think we're all hoping for bragging rights, but what do you want to get out of this big read other than that? I admit I know nothing about the story, but if the Russian lit we've read in the past year is any indication, it's going to be fantastic."
bookclub,"Hey, welcome back! How are we doing? I love this part of the book, and y'all, I think we picked the right time of year for it, because it's easier to put yourself in Genly Ai's shoes when your house is 65F and you can't feel your feet and you don't want to get out of bed in the morning.

I want to check in here because this is the point at which the book really takes a bit of a left turn (ha ha) and goes from political to survival. Were you expecting this? How do you think it changes the story? It made the entire thing feel a lot more personal for me -- I understood the politics to a degree that allowed me to enjoy the book, but at the point we reach in this section, when Genly escapes with Estraven, the entire tone of the story changed and became a lot easier for me to understand.

Why do you think the author does this? Does it improve the story for you? I'm wondering if it happens so we can explore two facets of the world of Winter: how gender shapes the political sphere and then how it affects interpersonal relationships.

Speaking of interpersonal relationships, why do you think Estraven helps Genly escape, at such great personal cost to himself?

What else did you notice about this part?"
bookclub,"As I mentioned previously, I wasn’t feeling very engaged in the story. But things turned around for me with these chapters. 

Warning: If you haven’t read chapters 41 – 48, there could be **SPOILERS** ahead.

After the strange meeting that didn’t happen with Mme. Bonacieux, D’artagnan keeps his appointment with the Cardinal who says he knows they’re not going to be buddies, but he would like D’artagnan to be a member of his Guard. Shocked, D’artagnan declines. The Cardinal insists that no one else can protect him from the dangers out in the big bad world. D’artagnan declines again, but they part on respectful terms. 

Since D’artagnan isn’t a Musketeer, he’s separated from his friends during the campaign. He’s ambushed one night and shot at, but manages to escape. The next day on a mission, D’artagnan meets up with the same men who ambushed him, managing to kill one and detain the other. He discovers that Milady sent the attackers and Mme. Bonacieux is safe in a convent. Shortly after, D’artagnan receives poisoned wine and is tricked into thinking the gift is from the Musketeers. Luckily, the Musketeers arrive just in time to thwart Milady’s second attempt to murder him. 

Later Athos, Porthos and Aramis run into the Cardinal who requests their assistance.  The Cardinal just keeps surprising us with his civility and manners! They escort the Cardinal to a secret meeting at an inn. Athos eavesdrops on the conversation between the Cardinal and Milady. Alarm bells sound off when Athos hears Milady’s voice. The Cardinal and Milady agree that if the Duke of Buckingham is put to the sword, he will take care of her D’artagnan problem.

After the Cardinal leaves, Athos returns to the inn to confront Milady. It’s not a friendly reunion, as you can imagine. Athos doesn’t mince words. He tells her if any harm comes to D’artagnan, she’ll really wish she were dead. He takes the orders the Cardinal gave her and leaves Milady shaking her boots. I loved this scene, Athos is so awesome.

Athos joins D’artagnan and the Musketeers and shares what went down. The Musketeers agree they must rescue Mme Bonaciuex after the campaign since it must be so boring hanging out with nuns. They decide to send a letter to Lord de Winter to warn him about Milady and another letter via Mme de Chevreuse to warn the Queen about the Cardinal’s plot.

Suddenly the Musketeers are attacked, but they fight back and win. The Musketeers are celebrated as heroes and the Cardinal learns of their bravery. He visits M. de Treville and asks him to make D’artagnan a Musketeer. Wow, the Cardinal really is an upstanding guy .. *or is he?*

**Questions**

What did the Cardinal mean when he told D’artagnan that only he could protect him from the dangers out in the world? What powerful enemies is the Cardinal warning him about?

The Musketeers decide to send a letter to Lorde de Winter to warn him about Milady. Why do you believe they didn’t decide to warn the Duke of Buckingham directly?

The Cardinal and Milady were revealed to us in a very different light in these chapters. We already knew the Cardinal was two-faced, but he was very respectful and even (dare I say) kind towards D’artagnan and the Musketeers. As for Milady, we learned she’s not always a ball breaker, but capable of fear and vulnerability. I thought that made these villains more interesting. What do you think?

**Happy holidays! Next post on December 26th.**

P.S. *The Three Musketeers* is an excellent way to excuse yourself from awful holiday situations involving relatives and people you generally don't want to be around. Enjoy!"

Hey 3M readers? How’s it going with the book? Are you liking/loving/mehing it? I'm enjoying the book, but can't say I'm feeling charmed the way I expected. 

Warning: If you haven’t read chapters 32 – 40, there could be **SPOILERS** ahead.

D’Artagnan has been visiting Milady every day and trying to gain her trust. Milady’s servant, Kitty, pulls D’artagnan aside to confess her love for him and to just put it out there that Milady’s in love with Count Comte de Wardes. Also, Milady hates his guts and wants revenge because he failed to kill Lorde de Winter. Oh, and she’s probably involved in the kidnapping of Mme. Bonaciuex too.

D’artagnan immediately sees an opportunity to manipulate the situation and uses poor Kitty to carry out his plan. He writes a letter pretending to be Count Comte de Wardes and requests a meeting with Milady. Pretending to be the Count, he enters Milady’s weirdly pitch black bed chamber, pleasing her to the extent she gives him a magnificent ring to remember her by.

D’artagnan reveals to Athos what he’s been doing. Athos recommends he stop seeing Milady (and happens to recognize the ring she gave him). Milady is livid that the Count Comte de Wardes is rejecting her and sends for D’artagnan. She makes D’artagnan promise he will kill the Count. After spending the night together, she’s still obsessing about killing the Count. D’artagnan’s sick of it and confesses it was him all along. Milady attacks him and in their struggle reveals a fleur-de-lis stamped on her shoulder.

D’artagnan races back to Athos and they are pretty sure Milady is the woman from the story Athos blubbered when he was drunk. They head back to D’artagnan’s home and run into Kitty, pale and trembling because no other words can describe her.They send for Aramis and ask him to help Kitty find new employment, preferably with someone who isn’t stone cold crazy. Bonus points if they aren’t an agent of the Cardinal.

D’artagnan and Athos sell the ring to buy equipment so they can join France’s campaign against England. When they meet with Aramis and Porthos, two letters arrive for D’artagnan. The first letter D’artagnan believes could be from Mme. Bonacieux. The Musketeers discuss whether it could be a trap and decide they will back him up to be safe. However, the second letter is from the Cardinal requesting D’artagnan’s presence. *Dun-dun dunnnnn!*

On arriving at the meeting spot for the first meeting, a carriage passes by and Mme. Bonacieux sticks her head out the window and puts her fingers to her lips. D’artagnan gallops after the carriage, but the window is closed and disappears. What’s up with that? He can’t make any sense of it (and neither could I). Nothing left to do, but go see the Cardinal.

**Questions**

Let’s talk about D’artagnan’s behavior in these chapters. What do you think of way he treated Kitty? Even pretending to be the Count Comete de Wardes to jump into Milady’s bed could be considered morally questionable.

What was so significant about the fleu-de-lis on Milady’s shoulder? Do you think it’s proof that she’s the woman from Athos’ story? We still really haven’t learned what her involvement is with the kidnapping of Madame Bonacieux.

‘If you value your own life, and that of who love you, remain motionless, as if you had seen nothing.’ What do you think the letter to D’artagnan is supposed to mean? What was that whole passing carriage scene all about?

One more *The Three Musketeers* post before the holidays. Happy reading!"

bookclub,"Sorry this is late, you guys... I had a window of opportunity where it wasn't smoky as hell AND my neck didn't hurt, and I went on a six-mile horse ride, whoops. The horse hated every second of it, but it did us both some good.

Anyway, what I'm hoping to do here is to streamline things a bit so this Poem of the Week project becomes manageable long-term. So first, [here is a link to the first discussion where I outlined how to read a poem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/7h6o9s/poem_of_the_week_the_love_song_of_j_alfred/) Second, here's the basics. Each number corresponds to a read-through of the poem:

1. Initial, no-pressure read-through
1. Look at things that catch your eye, judge mood of the poem
1. Look at form, meter, what kind of poem it is, rhyme scheme, etc.
1. What's the narrative strategy? Story? Argument?
1. What do you think the poem is about?

And now, the poem:

**Tell All the Truth but Tell It Slant** by Emily Dickinson

&gt; Tell all the truth but tell it slant —

&gt; Success in Circuit lies

&gt; Too bright for our infirm Delight

&gt; The Truth's superb surprise

&gt; As Lightning to the Children eased

&gt; With explanation kind

&gt; The Truth must dazzle gradually

&gt; Or every man be blind —

Okay, so this one is *short*, but I'm finding it kind of difficult to talk about. First, some background: Emily Dickinson has a thing for the em-dash. [This article](http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/dickinson/dash.htm) I found after .25 seconds of searching explains it a little; [this article](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2014/02/dashes-performing-working-class-poetry-emily-dickinson-to-johan-jonson) refers to it as a ""sound of interruption"". I think generally it can be interpreted as a pause. Her capitalization, on the other hand, doesn't seem to have a completely-accepted academic explanation, but notice how she only does it on *some* nouns; that might a clue to interpreting this poem.

Emily Dickinson's poems also do not have titles. The title we're using is just the first line of the poem.

Let's chat about meter a little bit. I'm learning this too. It's written in iambic trimeter/tetrameter. An iamb is when alternate syllables are stressed, and you definitely get a rhythm with this poem. Read it out loud, and notice:

&gt; tell ALL the TRUTH but TELL it SLANT

&gt; sucCESS in CIRcuit LIES

You can tell which meter it is by the number of stressed syllables in each line. The first line has four (tetrameter), the second has three (trimeter), the third has four, the fourth has three, I stopped counting there. (I can't believe it's that easy, I never understood this in high school.) You may also notice that it rhymes.

So what about the meaning? I found this poem a little bit difficult to parse, but the first line helps; it introduces us to what the poem is about. Dickinson is giving us an imperative, and then she pauses to explain why, which is really the crux of the poem.

The [definition for slant](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/slant) may also help here:

&gt; transitive verb

&gt; 1 : to give an oblique or sloping direction to

&gt; 2 : to interpret or present in line with a special interest : angle stories slanted toward youth; especially : to maliciously or dishonestly distort or falsify

Who's seen the second season of *Stranger Things*? No spoilers (and please none in the comments), but there's an idea in there that you can't give people the naked truth because they'll never believe it, it's just too outrageous. You have to take a *circuitous* route to the point and maybe stop a little short of the full truth, and I think that's what Dickinson is talking about here. If you're going to convince your friend that Taylor Swift is a reptilian or that 9/11 was an inside job, you have to feed information to people gradually so they're more ready to accept the Truth's superb surprise instead of being blind to it like the last line says.

Do you agree with this interpretation? Is the topic of the poem (as you understand it) something you expected to see in a poem from the 1800s? What do you think of the imagery she uses? Could Lightning = something else related to the truth, maybe enlightenment? What do you think the special interest the dictionary definition mentions has to do with Dickinson's assertions? Do you think she's advocating for the *actual* truth to be told, or a version of it that supports the reader's views?

Do you think poetry is a useful medium for expressing ideas like this?

What else did you notice about this one?"
bookclub,"Good evening! Are we all still enjoying the book?

In this section, things start to get real, and we see Estraven flee from his posting. After the initial escape, he seems to have some good luck supporting himself in Mishnory. Genly arrives, and to his surprise, he meets Estraven at dinner.

Thoughts:

Listening to other people's dreams is a chore. Usually they only wind up in books because there's some deep symbolic meaning, never for pure entertainment. What's going on with Genly's dream, and what do you think it means? Do you think it's related to the story from Chapter 9?

What do you think it means that Genly is a tool?

I also want to talk about alienation. Genly is truly alone and is relatively unprepared for what he finds on Winter. He's been sent in to try to get them to join the Ekumen but he doesn't seem to know the best way to maneuver in any of the planet's societies in order to make this happen. He's still conducting anthropological observations. He's not only culturally at sea, but he's the sexual deviant amidst a sea of usually-sexless people who can't understand him (and vice versa). It's like the most isolating kind of culture shock.

Do you notice any other themes of isolation so far? Genly's interpersonal isolation seems to fit well with the climate, which affects him more than most of the inhabitants of Winter; it could also symbolize the frosty tones of many of the Karhiders, particularly Estraven. And Estraven's banishment -- it's like Genly's presence on Winter, but Estraven seems to have a much easier time in Orogeny.

Anything you noticed? Little passages you liked, observations you wanted to make about kemmering, thoughts about what it might be like if humans were thought of less as pairs, deep or shallow observations on the book in any respect? Shout out to /u/chipmunk_face and /u/aleqxander for making us some new top-level posts, by the way. Way to go!"
bookclub,"Anyone having problems to imagine the characters and the environment of the story? I picture them in a way, but I have a feeling to be completely off from the author intention!

So far I imagine the society and architecture of planet Winter to be similar to the Elven society in Lord Of The Rings, but with some technology.

A few examples: https://imgur.com/a/hP01h

I also see the lower classes of society as frugal and primitive. How do you Imagine the book overall? Am I that far away?

The ceremony of foretelling in chapter 5 was quite confusing to me. I couldn't picture what was going on. Additionally, the motivation for the presence of the schizophrenic, the kemmer, and the pervert as part of the ritual was not clear to me.

bookclub,"Warning: If you haven’t read chapters 25 – 32, there could be **SPOILERS** ahead.

After the excitment of the diamond brooch adventure, I personally found the following chapters a bit boring even though they did provide more insight into D’artagnan and the Musketeers as characters. 

When D’Artagnan finds Porthos holed up in the same inn recoving from his injuries, he allows Porthos to lie through his teeth even though he knows what really happened from the innkeeper.  If smiling through your friend’s BS isn’t the true meaning of friendship, I don’t know what is.

Then D’artagnan goes back to where he left Aramis, only to discover Aramis in the process of giving himself over to the church. Suspecting why Aramis intends to give up on Musketeer life, D’artagnan hands over a letter from Mme. de Chevreuse, his secret love. Church? What church?

Finally, D’artagnan seeks out Athos and is relieved he survived the ambush. Athos is falling over drunk when D’artagnan finds him. He regales D’artagnan with the story of a *friend* who fell in love with a girl from a lower social status only to find out that she was a criminal only using him for his money. In his outrage, the friend denounced the girl and hanged her.

Upon returning to Paris, the Musketeers learn that France is about to commence a campaign against England. They’re broke and have no equipment to go to war. Porthos ends up charming his lady friend, Mme. Coquenard for funds in a painful scene where he flatters her relentlessly and she knows she’s being shafted, but goes along with it any way.

Meanwhile, D’artagnan catches a glimpse of Milady and follows her in the street until she rides away in a carriage. He finds himself obsessing over her and Athos gives him heck about already forgetting Mme. Bonacieux (as did I). Later he sees Milady in the street arguing with a strange gentleman. D’artagnan steps up to defend her honor, but it’s just her big mouth brother, Lord de Winter. D’artagnan and Lord de Winter trade some insults and then a duel is scheduled.

The Musketeers duel with Lord de Winter and his seconds. The fight ends when the duellers decide they should kiss and make-up being gentleman and all. Lord de Winter offers to present D’artagnan to Lady de Winter to which D’artagnan squees like a 14-year old girl. Athos chastises him again and D’artagnan responds that he loves Mme. Bonacieux with *heart* and Milady with his *head*. D’artagnan meets Milady not just once, but twice in the same chapter! He must have charmed her with his, ahem, head.

**Questions**

Let’s talk about M. de Treville, the King’s captain of the guards. What do you think about his character?  Don't you think he takes the father figure role a little too far? D'artagnan has only been with the Musketeers a short time, but he's always granted leave to go on crazy adventures, loaned the King's horses, and is doted on by de Treville.

Isn't it annoying that D'artagnan has suddenly forgotten about Mme. Bonacieux? We haven't exactly seen him investigating her disappearance. If the Cardinal was hoping he was going to use her for bait, he's going to be sorely disappointed. I can just imagine him and Count Rochefort sitting around looking at their watches and waiting.

What do you think about Milady and D'artagnan suddenly becoming chummy? Do you think she's using her feminine charms to win him over and then turn him over to the Cardinal?

bookclub,"Who doesn’t love a good road trip? And this quote by Porthos is surely is up there with the one for all motto, “So let us go and get killed where we are told to go.”

Warning: If you haven’t read chapters 17 – 24, there could be **SPOILERS** ahead. 

A pledge by D’Artagnan to help Mme. Bonaciuex (and in turn, the Queen) sees our beloved Musketeers set out on a trip to London to retrieve diamonds the Queen gave to the Duke of Buckingham at their secret meeting. Things don’t go quite as expected on the road, as these things do.

Unfortunately, D’Artagnan is the only one who makes it to London. The Duke drops everything to help his beloved Anne of Austria, but is horrified to discover that the diamonds have been sabotaged by Milady (aka Lady de Winter). The Duke quickly commissions a jeweler to create two new diamonds so D’Artagnan can make it back in time for the King’s ball. The Duke and D’Artagnan bond during this time and shake hands in hopes of one day killing each other on the battlefield. 

At the ball, the King and Cardinal cause quite a commotion when they show two diamonds to the Queen and demand an explanation. Of course, the Queen’s diamonds are intact. *Awkward*! The Cardinal scrambles to make up a story to the King. Later the Queen rewards D’Artagnan with a gift for saving her hide. In a discussion with M. Treville, D’Artagnan reveals how he was involved with the incident at the ball. M. Treville advises him to get rid of the gift and protect himself from the Cardinal’s wrath.

Meanwhile, D’Artagnan received a note from Mme. Bonacieux requesting a romantic moonlit meeting. At the designated spot and time, she fails to appear, and he becomes crazy with worry. Interrogating some poor fella in her neighborhood, D’Artagnan quickly learns that Mme. Bonacieux has been kidnapped by Count Rochefort again with the help of M. Bonacieux! Worst. Husband. Ever.

**Questions**

It must be exhausting to be the Cardinal. He must be two-faced all the time to keep on the good side of the King, as well as execute his plots and schemes, only to have them fail thanks to the Musketeers. But I’m a little confused to exactly what his end game is. Does he just want power? Or does he just want to mess things up for people?

The Musketeers are bending over backwards to help the Queen conceal a love affair from the King. But wouldn’t it be better for the King to know she’s whispering sweet nothings with someone from a country they might go to war with?

Did anyone else forget that we first met Milady way back in the first chapter of the book? What role do you think she's going to play in our story?

What are highlights from chapters 17 – 24 of *The Three Musketeers* for you? Or share your general thoughts on the story with us."
bookclub,"This week's poem is [""Let America Be America Again"" by Langston Hughes](https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/let-america-be-america-again). I'm linking it because I don't think it's public domain. **Note that the poem is longer than it looks. It scrolls. I just now found this out.**

Like last time, let's read it through a few times.

First time, no pressure -- get a sense for what the mood is, figure out how you feel about it. Look at the imagery. Is it hopeful? Is it depressing? At the end, do you feel rebuked or rallied?

On your second read, either print it out or take notes. Circle or write down the parts that stand out to you. Pioneer on the plain? The millions shot down? The steel of freedom? The ""rack and ruin of our gangster death"" (I love that line)?

And what about the form? There are parentheses in the first part of the poem that seem to contradict the other things being said. What do you think the bit in italics is doing? Look at the rhythm and the rhyming scheme, which, as with ""Prufrock"", is loose and sometimes there, sometimes not.

On a third read, look at the poem's narrative strategy. Is it telling a story, making an argument? Is it introspective? Is the narrator struggling with a question or whether to commit some action, or is he more confident of his position than Eliot's narrator?

And finally, what do you think the poem is about?

As mentioned back when we did Prufrock, this is really not a complex poem in comparison, but the ideas are complex. A lot of us are still struggling to understand them in 2017. I remember cracking open *The Invisible Man* not long ago and being horrified because it turns out that all the points that Black Lives Matter and other black speakers make? They are not new. They've had them and they've been sharing them for hundreds of years and it's still possible for a white American woman to reach her thirties without hearing them.

But this isn't just about black Americans -- it's about the underclass in general. There is something for almost everyone to identify with here (except maybe women, who didn't get a callout, cough), and I think that's true today, a lifetime after the poem was written.

Thoughts:

* Have we, as a country, gotten any further than where we were when the poem was written? We've certainly had the Civil Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, *Obergefell v Hodges*, etc., but do these problems still exist?
* Hughes says early on that ""America never was America to me."" What do you think he's saying with the final line, ""And make America again!""? Does that contradict that first line?
* Do you notice any references to other literature? I can't tell if the ""O, Pioneers!"" part is a reference to Walt Whitman's [""Pioneers! O Pioneers!""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneers!_O_Pioneers!). If you're willing to put the extra work in, how do you think that poem compares to this? (I'm going to nominate it for next month if we do this again, btw.)
* Do you think this is purely an American poem, or can other countries and cultures relate to the central ideas?
* And what about the idea that the ""good old days"" weren't good for a whole lot of people? (Reminds me a tweet I read recently about nostalgia for the 50s, went something like, ""Calm down, we still have milkshakes and racism."")

What have you taken away from this poem? Are any of these ideas new to you? Talk to me!"
bookclub,"""Traffic is controlled, each vehicle or caravan being required to keep in constant radio touch with checkpoints along the way. It all moves along, however crowded, quite steadily at the rate of 25 miles per hours (Terran). Gethenians could make their vehicles go faster, but they do not. If asked why not, they answer ""Why?"" Like asking Terrans why all our vehicles must go so fast; we answer ""Why not?"" No disputing tastes. Terrans tend to feel they've got to get ahead, make progress. The people of Winter, who always live in the Year One, feel that progress is less important than presence.""


This is pretty much the opposite of how most people live right now. In capitalist countries, progress is required in order to appeal to customers and make money. On one hand, this drives a lot of innovations that make our lives much better (refridgerators, televisions, tampons), but at what point does this ""progress"" become unnecessary because it adds less and less value to our lives (a fridge with a touchscreen, a smart-assistants like Amazon Echo, Instagramming everything). Are we really better off because of these things? Or would we be happier in the long run if we traded that smart-assistant for talking to a sibling, or writing a grocery list together with your spouse? 

Will the progress bubble ever burst, in favor of presence? Maybe someday it will be considered taboo and uncool to take out your phone when having a meal with friends, or ""so 2017"" to have too many smart-things in your life. Or maybe it will never change, I don't know.

Either way, I think its interesting that LeGuin noted this difference in values from the Gethenians vs. Terrans, even way back in 1969 when she wrote this."
bookclub,"I had big plans for this initial LHoD scheduled post, but my city is covered with a blanket of smoke and I have tears streaming down my face from just having my eyes open, indoors. Work today was... interesting.

Anyway, I can touch type (df ;pm sd zo jave ,u fomgers pm tje rogjt leus) but I can't refer to the book at length. **So here's your homework: Make a post on the main page about the book.** It's not that scary, I promise! In fact, I'll give you some topics. Take one of these and run with it, or pick something new entirely!:

* There are some pretty complex politics going on on Winter. What's your understanding of them so far?
* Does gender tie into politics? Do you think the author could have written this story -- so far -- without the gender? (I'll address that again when we've finished the book.)
* Do you think it's important that Genly is male? How does that affect his interactions with the Gethenians? Do you think it'd be different if he was female?
* Have you noticed any symbols? Maybe the ice cold planet, for example? Any others?
* Do you see LeGuin's influence on any other books you've read, science fiction or otherwise?

I'm sorry I can't lead discussion more effectively tonight. I'm hoping to come back tomorrow to find a few new threads on /r/bookclub about LHoD that we can join -- hopefully I'll be in better form tomorrow and able to make some of my own."
bookclub,"Hello 3M readers! Is everyone enjoying the book? Warning: If you haven’t read chapters 9 – 16, there could be **SPOILERS** ahead.

Chapters 9 – 16 was packed with intrigue, romance and acts both heroic and cowardly. We were introduced to a number of new characters both fictional and historical that our beloved Musketeers are becoming slowly entagled with, including the cowardly M. Bonacieux, the sweet Mme. Bonacieux, and the sinister Cardinal Richlieu. M. Bonacieux was so shameless in agreeing to spy on his wife, I was hoping the Cardinal would turn the carriage around and throw him back into the Bastille!

Romance with a capital R ruled the day with d’Artagnan immediately upon rescuing and meeting Mme. Bonacieux becoming smitten with her and fantasizing about her paying his dinner bill. As well, we’re introduced to the Queen of France and the Duke of Buckingham, witnessing a secret meeting with pages and pages of the Duke’s gushes of affection. They were so romantic, heck even I was blushing!

Last but not least, the King of France enters the story and he’s annoyed, but it isn’t because France is at war with Spain or close to war with England. He’s annoyed because he learned the exiled Madame de Chevreuse has been spotted in Paris. Who is this mysterious Madame de Chevreuse? All we know is she’s very good friends with the Queen and is determined to help her fan the flames of love with the Duke.

Meanwhile, Athos is languishing in prison for offences he didn’t commit, but it’s okay because he’s *Athos*! Cool, calm and without a care.

**Questions**

Even though d’Artagnan and the Musketeers had never before met M. Bonacieux or Mme. Bonacieux, they showed no hesitation in deciding to help them. D’Artagnan again puts himself in opposition to the Cardinal and his men to rescue Mme. Bonacieux. Why do you think this is always their reaction? Is it all part of the job?

Some of the characters have made questionable decisions. For instance, d’Artagnan declares his love for the very married Mme. Bonacieux. Then he helps Mme. Bonacieux in her covert efforts to unite the Queen and the Duke which is a direct affront to the King of France. However, Dumas portrays these acts in such a romantic light, the reader might easily forget these decisions could viewed as wrong. What are your thoughts on the romanticism imbued in the story?

What are highlights from chapters 9 – 16 in *The Three Musketeers* for you? Please share your thoughts.

Happy reading!"
bookclub,"Hello 3M readers! I hope everyone is enjoying the book. It occurred to me that even if some of us are reading *The Three Musketeers* for the first time, we have a fairly good understanding of what the story is about. A few of us have watched the movies, but really the 3M story and characters are so immersed in popular culture, we’ve probably all absorbed this popular tale through osmosis.

Here are a few references to *The Three Musketeers* in pop culture that I could find:

**Movie Adaptations**

From 1903 to 2013, there have been at least 37 film adaptations of *The Three Musketeers*! This doesn’t include television series or spin-offs movies like *The Man In The Iron Mask*. Personally, I have watched the 1973 and 1993 movies, the 2014 BBC series and, with great delight, the cartoon *Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers*. 

**3 Musketeers Bar**

The 3 Musketeers chocolate bar was inspired by the *Three Musketeers* and when it was introduced in 1932 originally consisted of three separate pieces in chocolate, vanilla and strawberry. The idea was that the pieces would be shared between friends. However, due to rationing during the Second World War, the vanilla and strawberry pieces were phased out with the more popular chocolate piece evolving into the whipped nougat bar we know today. This actually used to be my favorite chocolate bar until Twix came along.

**Stranger Things**

In Season 2 of *Stranger Things* (**possible spoiler ahead**), Dustin, one of the main characters, discovers a slimy creature in his trash can. He sneaks the creature into his room and starts feeding it pieces of a 3 Musketeers bar. He decides to name the creature d’Artagnan, Dart for short. If you haven’t watched the show, *Stranger Things* features four middle school friends and the show is as much about their friendship (like the Musketeers) and sticking together, as it is about the scary things that happen in their town.

**Star Trek Enterprise**

In *Star Trek Enterprise* (2001-2005), Captain Jonathan Archer had a pet beagle named Porthos on the ship. He came from a litter where his siblings were named after the rest of the Musketeers. He even accompanied Captain Archer and the crew on a couple of away missions and had a few adventures on board the Enterprise.

If this is your first time reading *The Three Musketeers*, were you familiar with the story before starting the book? Have you watched any of the movie adaptations? Or have you seen references to the book or characters in pop culture? Share your thoughts below."
bookclub,"**Getting started**

When I got my hands on *The Three Musketeers*, I was very surprised to see that the book is for children! Or at least my William Barrow translation says it’s a children’s classic. Which I found confusing since I recently posted the story was originally published in *Le Siècle*. I don’t imagine hordes of children were lining up to buy the newspaper back in 1844.

I liked that Alexandre Dumas immediately introduces us to our hero, d’Artagnan, a poor boy from Gascon. Then riding to Paris and at his very first stop, d’Artagnan gets into a fight with a mysterious villain. Right away we learn d’Artagnan is both brave and a bit of a hothead.

**The Musketeers**

In Paris, we’re introduced to a number of important characters, but specifically our three Musketeers: Athos, Porthos and Aramis. I loved how d’Artagnan managed to get in the bad books with each Musketeer separately, but they all show up at the same duel later. Then Alexandre Dumas proves he’s a man who loves a good action scene and we have an amazing showdown when four of the Cardinal’s men crash the duel. How could d’Artagnan and the Musketeers not bond over this moment?

At this time, I can’t decide if I have a favorite Musketeer. I like d’Artagnan the least because of his rashness. I like Athos because he’s wise and has a commanding presence. I like Porthos because he’s jolly and funny. And Aramis because he’s laidback, but mysterious.

**First Impressions**

I think I’m really going to love *The Three Musketeers*. The book has already introduced us to some iconic characters, had lots of action and made me laugh. I think it's going to be an amazing adventure.

**Questions**

Do you think *The Three Musketeers* is a children’s story? It has certainly been easier for me to read in comparison to, say, The *Brothers Karamazov*.

What is your initial impression of the story? Do you have a favorite scene or chapter?

Who do you think your favorite Musketeer is going to be? Or do you need to get to know the characters better?"
bookclub,"[Link to the poem.](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/44212/the-love-song-of-j-alfred-prufrock) I would reproduce it here but I'm not sure of its copyright status.

The epigraph is from Dante's *The Inferno*. Since probably none of us speaks Italian, I've grabbed a translation from [this site](https://unisophomoreenglish.wordpress.com/2017/03/01/translation-of-the-epigraph-in-prufrock/), which doesn't credit a translator:

&gt; If I but thought that my response were made

&gt; to one perhaps returning to the world,

&gt; this tongue of flame would cease to flicker.

&gt; But since, up from these depths, no one has yet

&gt; returned alive, if what I hear is true,

&gt; I answer without fear of being shamed.

So. Let's come back to this later. This is my first Eliot (I can just picture /u/Hongkie shaking his head) and we're learning together. Give the poem a read-through and come back, and we'll talk about how to read a poem.

The first thing I want you to think about is the mood of the poem. It's okay if you didn't absorb the whole thing -- one of the things about poems is that *every syllable counts*, so they're denser with meaning than short stories and novels. You're not going to get it all on the first or the hundredth go. But what kind of feeling did you get about it? I'm thinking that this isn't a love song at all; Eliot doesn't compare the evening to anything romantic, and he goes on to talk not about love imagery, but about things like sawdust restaurants and yellow fog and bald spots. There's a sense of inevitability. A poem's imagery is deliberately chosen to invoke a feeling. What are you feeling? Are you uneasy? Resigned? Depressed?

Let's read the poem again. Maybe print it out, or take notes. Are there phrases which catch your eye? I was struck by the etherized patient, the fog as a filthy cat (maybe it inspired Carl Sandburg, who wrote about the fog coming in on ""little cat feet"" a year later?), the narrator pinned to the wall, his head on a platter, rolling his trousers.

Next, we'll look at form. It has a loose rhyming scheme that doesn't always flow the way you'd expect. I can't detect a consistent meter. I don't think it's following any sort of structure, do you? He's all over the place. Check out that repeated line about Michelangelo, almost like a teeny little chorus. Look at the indented lines -- there are so few of them. Are they related in meaning? I can't tell. What about the epigraph? It looks to me like there's a relationship with the poem, particularly the Lazarus portion.

Then, what's the poem's narrative strategy? Is a story being told? Is Eliot making an argument? Is it a description feeling? To me it looks like he's struggling with a question -- there are questions upon questions, and reference to an overwhelming question (which he doesn't bother to ask). What he does ask: Should I? Is it worth it? Do these questions get answered?

Finally: what do you think the poem is about? Read it (again). I think he's wrestling with the idea of whether or not to ask his overwhelming question, putting it off again and again (""There will be time, there will be time"") until he's grown old and has other, more mundane concerns.

But there is so, *so* much more. We started with one of the most complicated poems. Talk to me about it! If you're feeling lost, here are some places to start on discussion:

* Why does he invoke Hamlet?
* Who is he talking to?
* Check out all the stuff about social niceties. What does he mean by ""I have measured out my life with coffee spoons""?
* Are there any contrasts you can pick out? Maybe something like the title against this dirty city he's walking in?
* Do you notice any literary allusions (Eliot is famous for them, wait until we get to ""The Waste Land"")?
* What about all the references to death? Lazarus, the epigraph, the ""eternal Footman""?
* Can you find patterns in the meter or the categorizable ideas?
* Does reading analyses of the poem help you understand it? Are there analyses you disagree with? Look at Shmoop and CliffsNotes, but also look at reviews from Eliot's contemporaries like [Ezra Pound](http://world.std.com/~raparker/exploring/tseliot/reviews/ezra_pound_poetry_magazine_1917.html). Wikipedia Notes and Further Reading sections are also great resources for reading about famous poems.

And if you're still lost, fear not -- our next poem is easier. We'll be talking about Langston Hughes's ""Let America Be America Again"" on the 9th."
bookclub,"Any final remarks on Watership Down?     
What do you think of tge author's claim that it is not a metaphor for anything?        
When I was a kid it was not unheard of as a children's book, and I found an illustrated children's edition at a store last month. What do you think?      
How about the movie? I see a pretty even split online between people who found the trippy mystical scenes enchanting or adored the score and those who say they found the violence too traumatic.      
Anyone read the sequel? I liked hearing some more stories and revisiting our 'rabbit friends', but I feel as a book it lacks structure and taken as short stories, many of the chapters are only so-so. They feel a little trite, too much like a children's special. I appreciate somewhat the attempt to have at least one doe have more of a role/development/power, but it feels very contrived and in the end I feel like she doesn't come off very positively."
bookclub,"It seems to me that there are at least a couple of points to make about the book when it comes to how it was written but please keep in mind that I'm not a native speaker of English. I read the book in English, too. Firstly, I'd like to ask you what have you thought of all the names of flowers, trees, grasses, and land formations (I hope that's what those are called - downs, ridges, valleys and many more). Could the story do without so many different names and details? How many of you actually looked up all or most of the names? Admittedly, I always checked the translation on my Kindle but ultimately I mostly skipped them at some point. Secondly, I must admit that I got lost in all the banks, brooks, ridges, and downs. This is what made the book difficult for me. I found some descriptions and definitions confusing. Maybe I'm just too unfamiliar with country landscapes. Excited to hear from you all and hope what I wrote makes sense :) "
bookclub,"Until December 1st rolls around and serious reading of *The Three Musketeers* begins, I thought I’d share a few fun facts about the book which you may or may not know.

* Alexandre Dumas wasn’t the only author of *The Three Musketeers*. Dumas had a long-standing partnership with Auguste Jules Maquet, an unsuccessful novelist and playwright. Rumor has it that Maquet was the one who developed the plot for the d'Artagnan trilogy and may have been deeply involved in the writing of 3M and many of Dumas’ other works.

* *The Three Musketeers* was published between March and July 1844 one chapter at a time in the Parisian newspaper *Le Siècle*. People would line-up anxious to get their hands on a copy to keep reading the story.

* Many of the characters in the novel were real people. For instance, d’Artagnan is based on Charles de Batz-Castelmore from Gascony and who took the name of Sieur of Artagnan from a property his mother's family owned. He had a distinguished career not under Louis XIII and Richelieu, but their successors Mazarin and Louis XIV. Porthos is based on Isaac de Portau, Aramis on Henry d'Aramitz, and Athos on Armand de Sillegue. All served as the King’s Musketeers.

* D’Artagnan has a cameo in the play *Cyrano de Bergerac* by Edmond Rostand (Act I, Scene IV). He congratulates Cyrano after defeating de Valvert in a sword duel.

* The motto of the Three Musketeers,”One for all, all for one”, (Unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno) is also Switzerland’s motto.

Did you know any of these fun facts about *The Three Musketeers*? Do you have any fun facts to share? "
bookclub,"The introduction to *The Left Hand of Darkness* isn't a part of my original schedule, and it's nothing I'd have normally read if I hadn't seen someone talking about it on Twitter yesterday. So let's talk about it. Is there a copy in your book? If not, you can find it [here](http://theliterarylink.com/leguinintro.html).

It doesn't give away anything you won't find out in the first chapter; rather, it's a bit of philosophy that describes what science fiction is, what the author's role is in writing the story, and what the reader's reaction to a good bit of fiction is.

One of the most interesting things about it was that it was written in 1976 (according to the copyright notice in my book). Science fiction isn't especially young, but it was experiencing its first real boom in the 60s and 70s. I think these days we are familiar with a variety of science fiction, but the introduction seems written for someone new to the genre. Do you think it's still applicable today?

Do you agree with her assertions? Is science fiction a metaphor? All of it? (Certainly her introduction is an enormous clue that LHoD is.) Have you read a science fiction story that doesn't have something profound to say about the nature of humans or society? (I want to talk about metaphors later on in the novel, once we have a better idea of what's going on, so try to keep the idea of science fiction as a metaphor in mind.)

What do you think of the idea that science fiction authors aren't prophets, and does their inaccuracy make their stories less valuable?

And what expectations does this give you for the book, if you haven't read it before? If you have, does it clarify anything? I read this book for the first time a few months ago, and with it still fresh in my mind, I feel like she's half defending the way she writes science fiction, and half advising her readership to not be on the lookout for an extrapolative plot."
bookclub,"What do you think of this chapter and Adams's choice to name it that? Was it, in fact, a deus ex machina? I feel that it was a nice balance to his condemnation of humankind. Yes they are destructive and selfish, but they also have the ability to redeem themselves and help nature. Given that his original audience for this story was his children, it makes even more sense that a child is the one that saves Hazel. "
bookclub,"Yes, as one reader points out, the word itself is jarring if you are not familiar with rabbit terminology. The does, or lack therof, are pivotal to the story. But we rarely hear from them. They are acquired, from the farm and then from Efrafa, but they don't seem to become a part of the band like, say, Strawberry. We get a tantalizing reference to Efrafan does thinking differently from bucks, but otherwise we don't hear much about their lives or perspectives.       
While authors writing novels about human characters in realistic settings are often naturally constrained by what women of the time actually do, fantasy authors can do what they like.  I'm disappointed that Adams has invented a whole religion and culture for his rabbits, including details like games, but has the does more as prizes to be won than full characters. 
 Hyzenthlay (and why must all the Efrafan does use only the Lapine young twister form of their names? Can't she be 'Shiny'?) has some good development in Efrafa, when there is nobody else for BigWig to talk to, but almost completely drops out of the picture afterwards and we don't get her perspective as we do many of the other characters.    
Maybe I'm being too hard on Adams, but I'd like to see more to the does than just them settling into being 1950's housewives with fur."
bookclub,"When reading Watership Down, I was reminded of 'Duncton Wood' by William Horwood. Both are fantasies about animals (Duncton Wood is moles), with lots of description of the natural world and characters being named after plants. Has anyone read Duncton Wood? Any thoughts? Other comparisons?"
bookclub,"The battle and subsequent trick are as heart-pounding as the escape, I think. I have only a few nitpicks. Not sure why, since they are aware of the concept from Efrafa, nobody has sentries posted. They were very lucky not to be taken by surprise. They should have known Woundwort would not refrain from an attack on another Warren. Also not sure how Hazel and friends manage to sneak out to get the dog without leaving an open burrow.       
I love that Woundwort's aggressiveness is his final undoing and that Fiver ends up scaring the Efrafans half to death with his creepy ways!"
bookclub,"So, after the dramatic escape we have the scenes on the boat and returning home. What do people think about this part? We get that tantalizing bit about Blackavar, dissenting opinions, and does. "
bookclub,"Hello! The December Gutenberg selection is *The Three Musketeers* by Alexandre Dumas. It's a long book, so the schedule is a wee bit intense, but the story should be wonderful.

bookclub,"Hello,
I have watched the most recent movie version of Murder... as well as the Suchet TV version and decided to read the book to see what, if anything, was different.

Spoilers---------------------------------------


In the novel, Ratchett is an old man who has kidnapped children before and killed them, kidnapped and killed Daisy and will do so again in the future.  He has no remorse for his crimes and has no shot at redemption.  I thought that was really intriguing and gave added motivation for the killers to dispose of Ratchett before he strikes again.

The other main difference is that the murderers go into Ratchett's cabin alone and stab him.  They do not know if he is already dead or who delivered the killing blow.  This is important for Christie's audience and its something she talks about in her other books that once a killer gets a taste for murder they cannot stop themselves from doing so again.  This is what makes Ratchett's killers different.  They don't know if they are murderers or not.  They all participated, but do not have the taste for murder like other Poirot villians.  

One of the things I have been trying to do is construct the order in which the killers entered Ratchett's compartment and stabbed him.  Three I can't figure out, but I thought it would be worth posting for people to check out and comment on.  

Order of People who killed Mr. Rachett 


(Masterman poisons Mr. Ratchett’s drink causing him to fall asleep) 
 
1.	Hector McQueen stabs first.  If the drugs had yet to take affect McQueen would have a good reason to be in the room as he is an employee of Mr. Ratchett. 
a.	He is also the individual that made the noise within the cabin that attracted the attention of the train staff.
b.	He also speaks French fluently and would be capable of giving the reply heard by the train staff and Poirot.
c.	He burned the letter in an attempt to conceal the Daisy Armstrong connection. 
 
2.	Masterman stabs second.  Having seen McQueen leave Ratchett’s cabin, Masterman goes into the room and stabs Ratchett.  He would have also removed any incriminating material (such as pipe cleaners, handkerchiefs, notes, etc.) as his profession requires an attention to fine detail.
3.	Colonial Arbuthnot stabs third.  He purposely leaves one of his pipe cleaners at the scene to incriminate himself and steer suspicion away from the other passengers.
a.	He is responsible for finding the watch, damaging it and setting the time in order to throw off detectives of the time of death.
i.	He would need to do so to provide both himself and McQueen with an alibi for the murder as the watch is set at exactly the same time they are seen having a conversation. 
  
4.	Mary Debenham stabs fourth following Colonial Arbuthnot’s lead. 
 
5.	Princess Dragomiroff stabs fifth.  Being a shrewd person, she would not attack until others participated thus ensuring the success of the plan.   
 
6.	Schmidt stabs sixth.  She would follow the princess in quick succession as they are always in each other’s company.  The princess is also frail and may need Schmidt’s help in getting her out of the murder scene.  
a.	She also is the most likely candidate for dropping the handkerchief knowing that the Princess is too frail to commit a murder on her own and is therefore not a suspect. 
  
7.	 Count Andrenyi ? 
  
8.	 Antonio Foscanelli ? 
 
9.	 Pierre Michel ? 
 
10.	Greta Ohlsson stabs 10th.  She is staying in the same room as Mrs. Hubbard and would attack at near the same time as her roommate. 
    
11.	Cyrus Hardman stabs 11th.  He’s the lookout making sure that no one exits or enters the train car that is not part of the conspiracy thus ensuring that there are no witnesses to the crime and that the murder moves smoothly.  He would wait till the last moment to attack as his role is primarily as a lookout and would only leave his position to complete the murder.  
 
12.	Mrs. Hubbard/Linda Arden stabs twelfth.  She is in possession of the murder weapon and stabbed him by entering through the shared door.  She is also responsible for opening the window as she has realized by now that the train is stuck.  The murder would most likely not have been started if the train was already stopped as that would ruin the plan the conspirators put in place.  She attacks last because she is the ring leader and wants to ensure that everyone plays their role.

bookclub,"As always, you are encouraged to start your own threads, but you may also post anything you want to discuss here."
bookclub,"Hi all,
Hopefully most of you are well ahead of this, but I blasted through the book the first week, so now I have to remember to post all the stuff I have mentally saved up! :).        
What did you think of the escape and the plan. I agree it is incredibly tense, even having read it many times. This time, I was really struck with how risky the plan and its implementation is. They brought just about everyone right into Efrafa territory and they hadn't even come up with the final part of the plan yet! Hazel is a heck of a good guy, but I feel he would have done better to be more ahead of the game. If BigWig hadn't accidentally killed the leader of that patrol, they all would have been likely captured.       
I liked the combination of tricks they used. Kehaar as long-range communication, the boat, and the 'someone in authority wants you' social-engineering trick. One part that doesn't quite add up though is why the General does not pursue them down the river. Adams makes a point of telling us that while the river is deep and smooth, it goes only as fast as a leisurely walk. I suppose Woundwort's crew is just too baffled by the magical technology?        
A discussion question I found online: Why does BigWig demand the story he does?"
bookclub,"Hi All!
Won't be long until we are done! Heads up that I'll post a discussion in the final week of November for anyone who wants to discuss the movie or_Tales from Watership Down_. The movie tracks the story pretty well IMHO, judiciously pruned, but be warned that it is a bit graphic in parts and has a trippy style in some parts that is quite scary. The sequel book is mostly a collection of stories told by rabbits, though we do hear some accounts of the Sandleford crew.

bookclub,"Hey everyone! I wanted to post the link for the discord here.

A discord is basically a chat room. You can text chat or voice chat here. We have channels for conversations about our selections, and just a general chat for talk about anything. 

So, here is the link: https://discord.gg/xh2F7Yj"
bookclub,"I’ve been looking around online for information on the best translations of *The Three Musketeers*, and have learned that 1) there are very few translations into English and 2) most people seem to agree that [the Richard Pevear is the best translation](https://literarytransgressions.wordpress.com/2010/05/07/rereadings-a-dumas-first-chapter-in-translations/). He evidently strikes a balance between readable and faithful to the original text, without cutting out a lot of scandalous stuff that the Victorians tried to pretend wasn’t there.

Pevear is the guy who translated our earlier read of *Dead Souls* by Gogol. His version is not only expensive on Amazon, it’s hard to find. It’s not coming up as being at any physical Barnes &amp; Noble stores in my area at all. I’m on the fence about ordering it myself, because it’s $17, and I can get the public domain translation for under $5, and sooner.

No one will judge you for reading another translation! But if you’d like to get the Pevear translation and have the pocket money to spend, here’s how to find it (we can’t link to Amazon on the sub):

* Go to Amazon.com
* Type in this ISBN: 978-0143105008
* Select the first version that comes up — the cover looks like a comic book.

Schedule for 3M will be decided this weekend or next week. I don’t think I’m brave enough to visit a bookstore on Friday, and it’s too hard to do with digital copies."
bookclub,"Hello, everyone! 

There was a clear frontrunner for the Gutenberg selection, so that will be *The Three Musketeers* by Alexandre Dumas. 

The modern selection is a bit more difficult. There are four front-runners. *Out* by Natsuo Kirino, *The Left Hand of Darkness* by Ursula K Le Guin, *The Wall* by Maren Haushofer, and *Memoirs of a Geisha* by Arthur Golden. They are tied at 18 votes apiece. I've decided the best way to handle this is to have a 48-hour vote off. (48 hours because of American Thanksgiving).

So, I am going to all that to happen within this post. I will make 4 comments with each title. Please vote for the title you want to read. In 48 hours, the winning selection will be announced.

It is 7:45 pm PST, on 11/22, so voting closes at 7:45 pm PST on 11/24. 

Thanks guys! "
bookclub,"Woundwort is a heck of a villain, isn't he? This read I noticed that Adams gives his backstory in such a way that I think we are supposed to feel a bit sorry for him as well as just understand him better. Did anyone else get a brief moment of pity for him?      
I also noticed this time that although Woundwort is supposedly obsessed with safety, he instituted practices like wide patrols, which kill as many as 'five or six in a bad month.' Makes you wonder what normal casualties were for an 'unsafe' warren. So he ends up a contradiction. He claims to want safety, but what he really wants is power.
What does everyone think? Sorry for posting a bit late."
bookclub,"For those of you in the US, again the FCC is voting on Net Neutrality. Here is a bit more information and ways to help. Please keep the internet free!

---

Hey everyone, the chairman of the FCC is very likely to announce a vote to gut neutrality, possibly as soon as Nov. 22nd. Once a vote is called, it will become much, much harder to stop ISPs from charging us extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling and blocking sites, apps, games, and streaming services.

But there’s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd.

We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won’t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents.

Please, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections. The time to act is now.
We also have ready-made banners, modals, and graphics of various sizes here: https://www.battleforthenet.com/#join

bookclub,"What does everyone think of Hazel's farm raid? Should he have done it? Should he have heeded Fiver and why did he not? Hazel even admits that he does it, not because he expects Holly to return without does, but to prove something about himself. Is this a good reason?"
bookclub,"What do folks think of this story? For me, although I love the tricks involved, it doesn't fit. A trial with all the too-human complications  of a jury, witnesses, cross examination and even court-room rhetoric seems incongruous with the rabbit 'culture' that Adams portrays elsewhere. It is too obviously a copy of a human institution that they should know nothing about. And the rabbits who couldn't grasp the idea of a peg or representational art don't seem a bit confused or surprised by it. The story of the King's lettuce also strays a bit into uncharted territory with a monarchy, war, city, etc., though I felt those were a bit more of a natural extension of rabbit understanding.    
What does everyone else think? "
bookclub,"Thanks to the most excellent /u/inclinedtothelie, our intrepid moderator, we are going ahead with the Poem a Week experiment! So we’re not cluttering up the sub with voting posts every week, what I’d like to do is choose the first five poems here in this thread. The five poems with the most votes will be discussed on each of the five Saturdays in December. Mid-December, we’ll start another voting thread for January and again pick one for each Saturday. Voting starts today and will end on the 19th.

Please, nominate several poems! One poem per comment so voting is easy, just like we do for novels. The only requirement is that the poem is freely available online (please provide a link), wasn’t written by you or your best friend, and isn’t super long — let’s use Christina Rosetti’s “Goblin Market” as a benchmark and keep it to ~575 lines or below for now. Aside from that, anything goes: any period, any poet, free verse or structured.

So! What poems do you want to take a closer look at?"

bookclub,"Having a hard time coming up with posts for this section. There is lots of interesting material to be sure, but it seems like a lot of very different chapters, themes, characters, moods, styles that I'm not sure which to pick. So I'll just jump in with a few posts that strike my fancy and I encourage everyone to post things they would like to talk about and share as there is more than one person can cover.       
What do you think about the fate of the Sandlefield warren? As readers, literally readers of the notice board, we have an idea of what is coming, but I think a first-time reader might rightly assume that the rabbits would never hear from their old home again. Holly's tale confronts them and us with the full horror and with the cruelties inflicted by men. It is a punch in the gut after a few chapters of happy seeming-resolution and home-making.         
The gas is particularly awful. Incomprehensible to the rabbits, unexpected by the reader (unless you'd heard of this practice, which makes little practical sense to me), and echoing some of the worst atrocities of the 20th century, it is shocking, almost obscene.         
The only thing that could have made it worse, I think, is if Adams had emotionally invested us in some of the Sandleford rabbits. We hardly met any of them except the chief, who is not endearing. We do get to hear a few mentions of rabbits the WD crew knew, but nobody of much consequence. There were five in Hazel and Fiver's litter. Where are they when this happened? Or the parents or siblings or mates or kittens of the others? Adams gets criticism for this book being dark, but seems to carefully avoid the death or suffering of even a secondary character in this case. Is this to spare us from feeling too bad as potential occupants of thosefine new residences or is it just the literary trope of not killing major characters unless your name is Martin?       
OK, well that was all morbid. On to something more cheerful."
bookclub,"I️ feel like I’m helping him solve this murder,trying to be smarter than he is,but also knowing none of my theories will be right in the end."
bookclub,"Hey, /r/BookClub. The next voting thread will be posted next week, and as such, we are beginning to consider what we are looking for in selections for the month of December.

So, should we have more than one selection for the month of December? If we do, it would be a Gutenberg, or public domain, selection, and a second selection (likely without restrictions).

Second, there has been some interest in a poem a week discussion. A poem would be selected and read, and at the end of each week, it would be discussed within this subreddit. This could be ongoing beyond December. Is anyone interested in that? "
bookclub,"As most of you probably know, the novel is being turned into a film, which releases this Friday. As I've been reading the book, I've been visualizing the characters based off the actors who are portraying them, the trailers, pictures from the film, etc. I would like to discuss how you guys are visualizing the characters. Are you also incorporating the film intro the book as you read or are you visualizing them in your own way?"
bookclub,"Before we leave the first section behind, does anyone have anything to share about it? For me, it is my favorite part of the book.     
One thing that struck me a lot thus reading is the absolute onslaught of botanical vocabulary. Not only do many of the rabbits have plant names, but the text is constantly mentioning the plants in the surrounding countryside by names. I guess it makes sense that plants are super-important to rabbits and so feature heavily in the book.        
Edit: oh an please send me any read-runner feedback. Either here or by pm. I've not done this before, so I have a lot to learn. We don't have a lot of comments or posts and I can't tell if that's because my running is haraka, we just have a small group, everyone is just content with reading and lurking, or if we are all following Cowslip's philosophy. :)"

bookclub,"The quotes before the chapters are probably my least favorite part. I'm inclined to leave analysis of them, if desired, to other readers to add here, as it would be a ton of work and I'd rather post on other topics. So please add any special explanations, insights, or opinions in them here. Maybe someone will do such a brilliant job of discussing their favorite that I'll be won over!"
bookclub,"I imagine most readers are as far as the blessing of El-ahrairah. What do you think of it? A few points of interest:         
1. I am strongly reminded of Genesis, especially the dramatic and simple opening line. I've got some other comparisons to make, but I want to wait and see if a better Bible scholar than myself will post about it.         
2. Mankind is not mentioned at all. You don't even hear of men getting a gift or joining the elil. We are not worth mentioning versus more important predators like weasels or maybe we are somehow outside of creation? Unnatural, uncreated, unblessed by Lord Frith.       
3. Frith, it seems, has a soft spot for humor. Not only does he keep El-hrairah around as a trickster character, but instead of just blasting him using his godly might, he takes him down a peg by means of a trick and even blesses el-hrairah's 'bottom' in all its ignominy.         
4. I like how plausible this story seems as one told by rabbits. It centers the 'true creation' of the animals, their gaining of unique traits, around rabbits. They aren't given dominion, but their defiance led to the animals all getting unique gifts and the elil getting their purpose. Other things are also completely from the perspective of a rabbit in that part of England. Rivers flow to the West, as they do there and cows are invincible giants in a world where a rabbit would never see an animal that would kill a cow and have no notion of their slaughtering by humans.          
The stories are one of the best parts of the book for me, how do the rest of you feel and what observations do you have to share?"
bookclub,"Starting this thread in case anyone wants to post regarding comparisons between this and other books read by the subreddit.       
I'll get the ball rolling with an odd but recent choice of Mansfield Park. Having re-read them with the group back-to-back, there is a contrast that really hit me hard.      
MP has a very dark mood of mental oppression and psychological bullying. Almost all of the nasty stuff that is done to Fanny and mean, selfish deeds done by the other characters is so sly, conniving, and complicated. (With the exception of a few times when Mrs Norris breaks the rules and shocks everyone by being directly nasty, which actually usually makes someone come to her defense.) The Bertram daughters try to secure the best seat near Mr Crawford 'with the most appearance of obliging the others.'  Tom ingratiates himself with Fanny and gives the appearance of a kindly cousin by giving her trinket boxes, but exposes her to embarrassment and ridicule and uses her shamelessly for his play and to escape a card game. Lady Bertram uses her son's sickness as a sort of game, providing her with something to elegantly drivel on about in letters.  Fanny is even so conditioned to not speak up that she conceals even her petty need for writing paper and tries not to look impatient when Mrs. Crawford is hogging her horse. Everyone uses manners, sly hints, heavy customs, etc to try to get what they selfishly want and deprive others while looking superficially well-bred. Everyone is being rather 'fake' as we would say today and it makes a gilded cage for Fanny who cannot even speak of her mistreatment or express an opinion without earning a label of being foolish, uncultured, or ungrateful.         
In WD, things are a lot more straightforward. Even though rabbits are renowned tricksters and there is some manipulation and deception and even violence, there are not the lies on top of lies on top of lies or psychologically-convoluted oppressions that are sources of dark humor and isolating, confining mood in MP. If a rabbit has a quarrel, he confronts, cuffs, or curses you to your face. He doesn't send you away on a miserable trip to change your mind under the guise of kindness. You aren't expected to thank the Owsla for stealing your treat. Most deceptions and tricks are only one layer deep. Even the worst deception of the first section is one of omission. In some ways, changing to read WD felt like a breath of fresh air after the mentally stifling trickery of MP. So much for high civilization!"

bookclub,I borrowed it brim my grandmother to read for the up coming movie. I’m excited to start and ready to read. 
bookclub,Those of you who are starting the read will be getting a strong dose of Lapine in the next week. I think most of it is introduced in the first section. What do you think of it? How does its inclusion affect the book? Remember there is a glossary in the back in case you forget what the words mean.
bookclub,"This thread is to inspire those just starting or about to start the read.          
Where did you get your book? I went to what seemed like every bookstore in town trying to find a copy. I'd expected to be able to get a used one easily, but no luck. Only a first edition at one place and an illustrated version in the children's section at another. Finally got a new paperback at a local store.       
What do you know/anticipate/wonder about the book, if you haven't read it before? I remember being puzzled by the title on this thick tome in my parent's bookshelf as a child. Why was 'Watership' one word and what would it mean for a ship to be 'down', I thought! These things are so confusing, especially when you are eight!        
Picture challenge: if you encounter (or seek out) anything related to the book this month, I encourage you to post a pic.        
Movie: the cartoon movie is very interesting in its own right, would anyone be interested in discussing it in the extra time at the end of the month?        
Your own 'pre read' challenges, topics, thoughts?"
bookclub,"Hi all! I'm new to the group and not lead before, but I'm going to try to keep things fun and quirky.     
A few notes on the reading to come!      
Posting/Marginalia: Keeping with the current trend, I'm going to hold off on making a marginalia post and instead encourage everyone to start threads, even on small items. There is plenty of room for more traffic on the sub. If you really feel that you have a tiny item that requires a marginalia thread, go ahead and start one.       
Introductions: Let's hear from our readers! Let us know how you chose to read this book with us, what you know about it, what you hope to get from the reading, etc! I just read Mansfield Park with the group, did anyone else?     
Schedule: everyone pick your pace! I imagine for some, Thanksgiving and other holidays are a bit of an obstacle, but others may find them a welcome break for reading. If you post plot items that are beyond the schedule, please call out spoilers.       
Reader Discretion: This book can be a little controversial regarding audience. While the characters are rabbits, and the stories were originally created by the author to amuse his children, it has some content that you may decide makes it unsuitable for young children, or require contextual guidance from adults. Mating is mentioned, but not depicted. There is quite a bit of violence, some scary events,and a description of a disaster from a traumatized survivor. There is also what could be considered implied institutionalized rape. Personally, I read this book and saw the movie at a very young age, but that was before most parents worried about such things much. These negative items are all a part of the story and I don't think would be considered gratuitous, but I wanted to mention them in case we have families reading together or very sensitive readers who might be misled by this book being often in the children's section.            
"
bookclub,"Since the book is divided into four parts, I am going to make the really radical suggestion that we read about a part a week. Each part is around a hundred pages, so it is a good-sized book, but the language is not complicated, so it moves along.        
November        
1-7 - Part one, chapters 1-17.   
8-14 - Part two, chapters 18-29.      
15-21 - Part three, chapters 30-38.        
22-28 - Part four, chapters 39-50.        
This leaves the scrap-end of the month for catching up and the Epilogue

bookclub,"Anyone have a small scene, quip, or moment that isn't dreadfully literarily important, but tickled their fancy this read?      
For me, when Mrs. Rushworth is giving her tour and says '...and here are the curious pheasants', I'm always mentally craning my neck. Austen doesn't seem to share my love of poultry (though there are a lot of mentions of various types), and hurries us along, but I want to see them, dangit! What is so curious about them anyways? If you google pheasants, there are some really amazing species out there, rivalling peacocks and parrots. Maybe I've seen too many copies of 'Pride and Prejudice and Zombies', or those paintings of chocolate box cottages that hipsters have adorned with UFO's and Yetis, but now I imagine the group standing around a half-dozen of these! https://goo.gl/images/5etJYK

bookclub,"Here are the selections. Right now, we don't have read-runners, or a schedule. If you would like to volunteer to run one of these reads, let us know!

bookclub,"Fanny is a hard character for modern audiences to love because her morality comes across as very prim to our standards and she lacks the modern virtues of self-esteem and assertiveness. But does she ever make a 'real' mistake? That is, does she ever do something that Austen and her contemporaries would consider an error?           

Austen's other characters have faults and make mistakes.  They learn and grow, but they are imperfect people. Elizabeth relies too much on appearances and has a bit of a temper. Emma is meddling and a bit stuck up and bossy (as well as wasting her talents through lack of application). Catherine thinks life is like Twilight and is hopelessly naive. Anne is mostly past her youthful stumbles, but is still paying for having been influenced into a bad decision and almost gets drawn into a schemer's web.        
Poor Fanny doesn't even get to have a tranquil mind as she is constantly second-guessing herself when others urge conflicting and unreasonable duties on her. "
bookclub,We will announce the chosen selections tomorrow.
bookclub,"What are some of the main topics the book deals with, or builds on?
Here's a starting list.  Some of these, I think, relate closely to the
overall point of the novel, some are just building blocks.  What would
you add?


 * That upbringing has a bearing on an adult's morality

 * Fanny's being different than other people

 * Wealth, want, ease and hardship

 * Economic dependency (As William's for preferment, or the pressure
to marry for money)

 * Physical frailty

 * Kindness &amp; cruelty, active or thru attention/inattention

 * Liveliness/social sparkle/wit -- their being at odds with moral propriety

The slave trade is mentioned a few times but even after reading the
novel a few times paying attention to that, I don't see it as a
successfully incorporated theme into the working of the novel, or
raising to the point of a major building block.

Finally, ""Memory"" is an important thing, but it's a bit different than
the others I mentioned.  There's the speech in the garden with Mary
Crawford, which is unlike any other speech by Fanny: in II.4 or ch 22:
""If any one faculty of our nature may be called more wonderful than
the rest, I do think it is memory.""  In part III, Edmund says he'd
like to blank out one specific memory: the week of the play.  I don't
remember other passages talking about it much, or major plot elements
(except Fanny's clear memory of Crawford's treatment of the Miss
Bertrams).  But I think it's deep in the difference between Fanny and
others.  She is always recalling the past and the narrative language
involving Fanny are more backward looking.  I think this is the crux
of something I mentioned before, about how the narration tends to be
slow at introducing new facts, and it always explicitly referring to
already transpired events."
bookclub,"This is the final section of *The Subtle Knife*, and where we'll leave off with *His Dark Materials* unless someone would like to take up posting for *The Amber Spyglass*.

Chapter 14 involves Lee Scoresby and Stanislaus Grumman’s escape in the balloon. It’s a bit of an atmospheric break from the rest of the story: a little mystical, a little like a dream, a little like a horror story. We hear from Grumman, somewhat casually, that Lee’s world has napalm, developed during a war with Japan. They also, evidently, had the Alamo.

What did you think of the ending? We lose Lee Scoresby in a heartbreaking scene, and even worse, Will and his father have only a moment of realization before Juta Kaimainen kills him. Mrs. Coulter learns how to control the Specters, in a confusing, unexplained turn that reminds me of Dr. Malone’s inexplicable computer program. (Clever that Pullman established that the Specters could be unbound from the earth, though, in one of the zeppelin dream sequences.) And two angels, who we’ll come to know as Baruch and Balthamos, find Will on the mountaintop with his dead father and request his help."
bookclub,"This post might be a day or two ahead of the schedule so fair warning. Not really any spoilers or anything.

The sentence below is from the beginning of Ch35 or Book 3 Ch4 (I think).

Note how the portion before the semicolon is very complex and even tortured. The part after the semicolon is very direct and understandable.

""Edmund was not unwilling to be persuaded to engage in the business; he wanted to know Fanny's feelings.""

The language matches up with Edmund's thoughts . He's tortured about whether to get involved, but he clearly wants to know Fanny's feelings."

bookclub,"What's your take on Book II?  Feel free to post your own synopsis,  or respond in the comments  on this thread.

Here's my synopsis, without getting into recitation of events: The main line of the story in book II is that
Crawford decides to engage in a flirtation with Fanny, and winds up
smitten himself.  That plotline sounds more like a farce than a
serious novel, and I could see some readers rejecting it as
implausible.  But to me, the foreseeable torment it gives to Fanny
makes it dramatically effective: she is pinned and forced to remain
within the bounds of civility, and you can see she will appear
irrational to everyone around her.

Another pattern in part II is that the social world of Mansfield Park
collapses as Sir Thomas only wants the Rushworth's as company, then
the sisters leave; subsequent to that it reopens, as Sir Thomas takes
notice of Fanny's social potential -- there's sort of an hourglass
shape to the household's connectedness to the world.  Interesting that
Sir Thomas is the driver; his early absence and flintiness in the
opening scenes makes his emergence -- and the marked evidence of the
household running as a patriarchy -- not feel quite well-balanced to
me.

"
bookclub,"Pullman did a really good job of suspending my disbelief until he got to the computer programming bit in Chapter 12. What exactly did Dr. Malone do? How did she write a program like that without access to the Cave? I’ve always wanted that explained. I assumed it would make sense when I was a programmer, but of course it doesn’t. How exactly do you get Dust to respond to a chat program? Or is the Cave already plugged into Dust, and the new program’s back end accesses it in the same way the old one did? I wish he had described it better.

We discover that Dr. Malone “must play the serpent” in the prophecy. What does that mean? What do you think the angels watching Lyra and Will sleep mean?

I’ve always found Lyra and Will to be much less compelling when under the protection of someone else; Chapter 13 is no different. As a kid, I wanted to be like them, to have that sense of cunning and independence… when I was sixteen and doing something I had to keep secret from my parents, they were good role models, though of course I was older than they were. Under the supervision of the witches, and in cooperation with them, neither Lyra nor Will needs to take the lead, and this, for me, has always been where *The Subtle Knife* kind of falls apart.

Did you like this section? I’m especially curious to hear criticisms."
bookclub,"I think the plot in Mansfield Park involves concrete, individual items 
that get mentioned, have some significance to a couple episodes, and
then fall out of the story.

I don't see symbolic significance to them, and it doesn't feel like a formula.  I suspect it's just a characteristic of Austen's writing.  Maybe it's my imagination? But for example, in other novels
you've read lately, are there objects that recall specific scenes
like these do:

The paper and writing materials  
The key at the garden  
Mary's Harp  
Roses to be cut  
Green Baize  
The necklace Mary gives Fanny (the one from Edward less so)  
Later, the silve knife  
  
Mushier:  
  
Poney, and later the mare  
The Avenue at Rushford's house  
The Grant's dining room table  
The East Room

bookclub,"Recap and marginalia -- 

When Sir Thomas returns, the play is quashed


Ch II.3 has the famous line about Fanny brining up the slave trade and there being absolute silence.

Maria is emotionally crushed by Henry Crawford and marries the unloved Rushworth, then Maria and Julia are yanked out of the story, they go ""off state"" to Bath, from whence at some vague time they'll head for  London.

Chapter 4 begins:

""Fanny's consequence increased on the departure of  her cousins"" and it seems to me the novel starts to set its more  interesting course right here.  Her personality is established and the major players have all been introduced. 

The speech about memory being the most human faculty is in Ch 4 -- Fanny is awkward with Mary Crawford but despite Fanny's reservations the two are growing closer.

Edmund: ""we may sometimes take greater liberties in November than we do in May"" -- perfectly reasonable, but loaded: it's *structurally* like saying we might allow greater character flaws in the beloved than we would normally.

Chapter 6, 7, 8 -- Fanny invited to Grants' house; we find Crawford has decided to toy with *her* affections now, and Bertram decides to throw a ball so William can see her dance.  Chapter 8 ends with the gift of a necklace from Mary to Fanny."

"
bookclub,"In 2.4, Mary Crawford and Edmund have a discussion about their respective comfort with certain levels of income; Mary wants the highest income possible and thinks it will make her happiness increase, and Edmund, who is going into the clergy, responds that he wishes only not to be poor.

On the surface it's an innocent exchange, but we know that these two have a bit of a crush on each other, and underneath, there's something else going on. It's a negotiation. Edmund is not quite being asked to choose between Mary and a career as a parson -- not yet, at least -- but he's being felt out for his willingness to abandon the idea, or at least to make concessions to what she feels she needs to be happy.

This isn't the first time it's happened, either. Back in 1.9, when they and Fanny are wandering around the ""wilderness"", they speak directly of Edmund's chosen career, and Mary indicates that she feels it's beneath him. She offers an alternative in this conversation: he can go into law.

Edmund enjoys Mary's company, but he doesn't actually concede any ground in either argument. In both cases they agree to disagree; he is firm that *this* is the way his life will be. However, since this is Victorian England, I think it's a bit of a different dance than it would be today; they're not hashing out what their future might look like or how many kids they might have. Mary is only communicating her conditions for marriage. It's up to Edmund whether he proposes, and what he brings to the table when he does.

Any thoughts on this? Any other coded conversations you've noticed?"
bookclub,"Austen has always baffled me with the word ""cried"", and I think this little thing is one of the main reasons that I disliked her books for so long.

What in god's name does she mean?

To me, ""crying"" is *shouting*. I picture it as something between a scream and a shout, high-pitched in the sort of way you'd get if you were trying to rile up a dog. Jane Austen uses it in situations where such excitement is absolutely uncalled for, but the mental image I get is of over-dramatic people being shrill about nothing at all.

So that can't be how it's actually meant. Can someone help me figure out how I *should* be picturing this? Are the characters just speaking with a touch more excitement or emphasis than normal, or is it something else?"
bookclub,"I was curious about the rules of Speculation, the game that is played in chapter 7 of volume 2, so I looked them up. In case anyone else is interested:
&gt; 
&gt; Preliminaries.

&gt; Everyone starts with the same number of chips and at the start of each deal antes one to a pot. Deal three cards face down on the table in front of each player in a stack, then turn the next card of the pack to establish a trump suit. (Not that there is any trick-play. Trump, in this game, means the only suit that counts for winning.)

&gt; Object.

&gt; To be in possession of the highest trump when all cards in play have been exposed. For this purpose cards rank from high to low AKQJ1098765432.

&gt; Play.

&gt; The trump turn-up belongs by right to the dealer, so if it is an Ace the dealer wins without further play. If it is not an Ace, but is high enough to interest anyone else, they may offer to buy it from the dealer, and the dealer may haggle about it, or auction it, or keep it, as preferred.
&gt;  
&gt; Each in turn, starting with the player to the dealer's left - or, if the turn-up was sold, to the purchaser's left - turns up the top card of his or her own stack. This continues in rotation, but omitting the player who currently possesses the highest trump. If and when a trump is turned that is higher than the one previously showing, the player who turned it may offer it for sale at any mutually agreeable price, or refuse to sell it. Either way, play continues from the left of, and subsequently omitting, the possessor of the highest trump.
&gt;  
&gt; Furthermore, anyone at any time may offer to buy not necessarily the best visible trump, but any face-down card or cards belonging to another player. The purchaser may not look at their faces, but must place them face down at the bottom of his or her stack and turn them up in the normal course of play. (The time to indulge in this piece of speculation is when you currently own the highest trump and want to prevent someone else from turning a higher.)

bookclub,"Hi all,

I'm a bit discouraged by the lack of participation re: *The Subtle Knife*, and I'm going to be throwing in the towel at the end of the book. I do have a post written for each additional section, and more thoughts to share, so I'll see you guys through *TSK*.

If someone would like to lead discussion on *The Amber Spyglass*, you'll have at least one eager participant, but I think I'm about done shouting into the void. It was fun to try!"
bookclub,"In Chapter 9 we get a bit of an echo to the first chapter in *The Golden Compass*: Lyra hidden, listening, an important conversation taking place, a decanter of Tokay. It’s that first scene that sets Lyra on her adventure — even the Master says he can’t keep the child from being drawn into it — so I would expect a similar shift here. What is that shift?

Any thoughts on other things that happened? What do you think of the Lee/Hester chapters?"
bookclub,"Here is  my hypothesis: If you  take a random selection of MP's text, and a random selection of some other  piece of fiction, especially something considered ""readable"", more of the sentences in the MP sample will explicitly refer back to what has been said previously than in the other  sample.

The first thing I selected -- truly randomish, eyes closed clicking a gutenberg TOC -- the first paragraph directly supports this, and is characteristic of what I had in mind. The second paragraph less so, but ""as if they had been forced"" and ""offered to count his speeches"" are at least allusions to foregoing material.

I think Austen's style introduces new fact+event less rapidly than a lot  of fiction.  To demonstrate that on a bunchy of  selections on other books would be tedious to spell out, but  I'll keep  it in back of my mind, and would be curious if others  think this hypothesis feels right, or if you can express better than I what  I'm getting at. Or, if you  think I'm wrong, I'd be interested to hear that, too.

&gt; It was, indeed, a triumphant day to Mr. Bertram and Maria. Such a victory over Edmund’s discretion had been beyond their hopes, and was most delightful. There was no longer anything to disturb them in their darling project, and they congratulated each other in private on the jealous weakness to which they attributed the change, with all the glee of feelings gratified in every way. Edmund might still look grave, and say he did not like the scheme in general, and must disapprove the play in particular; their point was gained: he was to act, and he was driven to it by the force of selfish inclinations only. Edmund had descended from that moral elevation which he had maintained before, and they were both as much the better as the happier for the descent.

&gt; They behaved very well, however, to him on the occasion, betraying no exultation beyond the lines about the corners of the mouth, and seemed to think it as great an escape to be quit of the intrusion of Charles Maddox, as if they had been forced into admitting him against their inclination. “To have it quite in their own family circle was what they had particularly wished. A stranger among them would have been the destruction of all their comfort”; and when Edmund, pursuing that idea, gave a hint of his hope as to the limitation of the audience, they were ready, in the complaisance of the moment, to promise anything. It was all good-humour and encouragement. Mrs. Norris offered to contrive his dress, Mr. Yates assured him that Anhalt’s last scene with the Baron admitted a good deal of action and emphasis, and Mr. Rushworth undertook to count his speeches. 
"
bookclub,"Just a quick idea, not suggesting this is a central ""key"" to the
novel, but one facet to watch.

You can see is a two-way coming of age story -- Edmund and Mary
Crawford have a potential romance; for her, especially she has to
confront social expectations and her own; he has to confront
sublimated lust, and his internalized expectation of how a woman
should be.  Anyway, they're both very young adults, more like kids who
think themselves competent adults and are expected to behave as so.
They'll clearly be changed *somehow* by coming events -- possibly with
the plot bringing in some kind of feedback between them."
bookclub,"As we round the introductory chapters and head into the meat of the novel I am struck by how unlikeable and to some extents unrelatable these characters are.

Fanny is a very weak protagonist who is accepting of her circumstances and a pushover in almost encounter. Austen is constantly reminding us of her frailty and delicacy both physically and emotionally. To be honest, I'm growing quite tired of seeing her bend over and take it blow after blow.

Edmund is noble but frustrating. We like him because he defends Fanny, but his attraction to Mary, his accepting the role in the play, all point to a paradoxical inconsistency, which Fanny notices and is burdened by.

I can put almost every other character into the category of self-absorbed busybodies, with all their unique quirks and differences, yes, but none of them are relatable or very likable.

I wonder how long the book can go on like this. From the messy introduction of characters and cumbersome names, titles, etc. to learning in detail that they are all privileged gits, and now with these recent chapters, a big drama about an in-house play, which exhibits levels of childishness only paralleled by our modern day reality TV shows.

Mansfield Park is a one the cornices in my personal purgatory, a realm where you are obligated to do things you don't want to do for people you don't care about and all the while are gossiped about and set up for marriage. I see only two ways the book can hold my interest much longer: a dramatic change in Fanny or a reality check for Edmund.

I don't want this to just be some subjective rant so does anyone have any thoughts on the redeeming qualities of these characters or anything else that is keeping your interest at this moment in the book?"
bookclub,"Any thoughts on all the recollections of Lyra’s dæmon-separating trauma? The computer in Dr. Malone’s office makes the same noise, the subtle knife's edge has the same look about it. It's clear that while Lyra and Pantalaimon might not experience flashbacks or panic attacks, they are uncomfortable with these reminders.

(On the storytelling side, the recollections seem like an interesting way to tie all these inventions together, into a main theme of *otherworldliness* and *unnaturalness*.)

How do you think Lyra's fear has changed since the beginning of *The Golden Compass*? The first chapters mention some of the things she's afraid of, and for the most part, they're people like the Steward and Ma Costa who might smack her around when she's being an asshole. Has she changed beyond that?"
bookclub,"In Chapter 7, when he finds out that Lyra has “betrayed” him, Will has the following thought: “But it was *we*, for certain. He was bound to her now, whether he liked it or not.”

Why is this? We know Lyra; by this point she’s old and familiar, if somewhat more hysterical than she used to be. But Will’s known her for a couple of days. She’s a strange girl from another world, and their goals haven’t seemed to intersect. They don’t even really “bond” until Chapter 8, when Pantalaimon comforts him by putting his head on Will’s knee and licking his hand. This is an incredibly intimate gesture, and the text makes a point of noting that Lyra had nothing to do with it; her soul reached out him, as cheesy as that sounds. I think *that* is the point when they became bound together."
bookclub,"Lyra has her alethiometer stolen in Chapter 7. A thought:

Who is the man with the pale hair? I don’t remember ever finding out. He’s a rival of John Parry’s, and he’s looking for the green folder (and evidently the coordinates), but who is he *really*, and how did he find out that Lyra had met with Dr. Malone?

What is Sir Charles's end game?

Anything you noticed?"
bookclub,"In Ch16 we find that Fanny has taken over the room adjacent to her bedroom in the attic. It was formerly a school-room for her cousins but has become a sort of shelter or sanctuary for her. It became a place where Fanny could find ""immediate consolation"" from ""anything unpleasant below.""

Fanny would retreat to the east room for, ""Her plants, her books - of which she had been a collector, from the first hour of her commanding a shilling - her writing desk, and her works of charity and ingenuity...""

I'll be interested to see what role, if any, this room plays in the rest of the novel. "
bookclub,"About Austen's construction: establishing that Fanny is easily fatigued, and that Edmund attends to that, sets up the scene where Edmund has a pretext to abandon Fanny at the bench and go walk around the wilderness and park. 

Particularly galling -- the two of them get a glimpse of the Avenue which was Fanny's immediate motivation to want to come, and, unless I missed it, she never does get to see.

The scene itself is also interestingly complex -- various groups of people walking around, the key that Rushworth doesn't have giving Maria and Mr. Crawford time to go look at the view"

bookclub,"Hi guys, I'm just reading through chapters 14-18 at the moment and thought I would go looking for some background into the attitudes some of the characters (namely Fanny and Edmund) have towards the theatre and the prospect of a play being put on at Mansfield Park. I found [this](https://austenonly.com/2010/06/06/jane-austen-fanny-price-and-private-theatricals/) which has some good info but does contain some spoilers (I guess?) up to chapter 18 so it might be something to go back and read once you get to that point.

If anyone else has some insight into the concerns Fanny and Edmund have around the prospect of the theatre please let's discuss it - this is one of the things that has always put me off this novel in the past, as I find it hard to get my head around some of the archaic morals that govern the society and which are not so much of a key player in the plots of Austen's other works."
bookclub,"I know I am behind, but I just started Chapter 4 and in the second paragraph it says Mrs. Norris was ""assisting with their toilets"" in references to the Misses Bertrams. What does it mean?"
bookclub,"I have read this book multiple times and have seen the movie before but the physical description of the Crawfords really stuck out to me this time. Mary Crawford is described as having ""lively dark brown eyes, and clear brown complexion"" and Henry was ""black and plain"". Am I misreading the intention of the description or are they not white?"
bookclub,"This is a little disjointed sorry. Just some thoughts I was having about Edmund.

I think it’s fairly clear that while Fanny is in love with her cousin Edmund, she has a bit of a hero-worship complex going on. Edmund is the only person who is actually consistently kind to her or even considers the fact that she might actually like to be included in some of the fun, so it’s natural that she would gravitate towards him particularly as a young, sheltered woman with little experience of anyone outside of her own family.

However, as the reader I’m unconvinced at this point by Edmund. As soon as Mary Crawford is introduced, we begin to see a very different side of him. Although he still cares for his cousin he is easily distracted by a pretty face and lively manner - everything that Fanny is not. The episode with Fanny’s horse where he forgets to allow her any time for her needed exercise shows how disastrous this flakey attitude is. 

Fanny’s opinions have obviously been shaped very much by Edmund over the years as can be seen in the conversation the pair have over Miss Crawford’s fault in disparaging her uncle. And yet Edmund continues to allow Miss Crawford to insult his chosen profession, and argue with him. He seems to be enjoying the challenge of her in comparison to Fanny, who has always been in agreement with him.

I’m really not sure what to make of him. He is obviously a bit too serious for his own good, and I think Miss Crawford rather likes pushing his buttons so to speak and getting him to argue with her. But the only person who is actually annoyed by this is Fanny - the more Mary argues, the more Edmund seems to enjoy having her around and the more he is inclined to blow off his cousin, as evidenced at the end of chapter 11.

Edmund appears as a more sensible character in comparison to his sisters and mother but he is still spoilt and careless at times, as well as a bit pompous and self-righteous. I wonder where Austen will take his budding infatuation with Mary Crawford and what this means for Fanny who is so opposite to her in every way. "
bookclub,"Lots of things happening here, but let’s talk about how they’re coming together.

In Chapter 5, we have Will reading the letters for the first time. He discovers that his father found a similar window in northern Alaska. I looked up the coordinates and there they were, on the tundra. In Chapter 6, we learn a lot more about these windows from the Cittagazze rider, Joachim Lorenz, who traces their genesis back to the Torre degli Angeli, the tower beneath which Will and Lyra defended the cat from the kids the night before. Then there’s the mystery of the Specters, whose arrival coincided with whatever happened in the tower, and whose arrival in force coincided with Lord Asriel blasting a hole between his work and the world of Cittagazze. And *then* we find out that the explorer Stanislaus Grumman is interested in these things, too, and that the church is interested in him.

If you’ve never read the books before, I’d be really interested in your opinion on what’s going on here. For those of us who’ve been through them a number of times, it might be more interesting to focus on how the threads of the story are coming together: the angels, the tower, the Specters, dæmons, Dust/Shadows, and the key that unlocks doors where there aren’t any doors.

Pullman also gives us a *lot* of information, particularly in Chapter 6, yet he manages to do it without obvious infodumps. At the same time, we don’t go through the tedium of finding out *everything* organically. Everyone we’re following — Will and Lyra, Lee Scoresby, Serafina Pekkala and Ruta Skadi — is conducting an investigation of some sort, and information is fed to us at the same time it’s fed to them.

A small thing I noticed and liked: “The Skraeling’s face now bore the same expression as the saint’s in the picture: an ecstatic straining toward oblivion. Lee dropped him in distaste.” Notice how the painting in question showed the saint’s dæmon being elevated toward *heaven*, but Pullman’s choice of words for what happens in real life is “oblivion”. I’m not sure if this is his POV or Lee Scoresby’s or both. Lee dropping him “in distaste” is a bit of a humorous line that tells us he doesn’t believe in any of that. He is (to me, anyway) a far more interesting character in *The Subtle Knife* than he was in the previous book."
bookclub,"One of the things I've been paying more attention to in this read is Lady Bertram's relationship with Mrs. Norris. And I don't think Lady Bertram is as passive with Mrs. Norris as I originally thought. Early on, she makes a snide remark about Mrs. Norris's cheapness; and then in chapter seven she makes sure Edmund knows that Mrs. Norris is the cause of Fanny's headache. (The first speaker is Edmund, the second is Lady Bertram.)

&gt; ‘Fanny has been cutting roses, has she?’ 

&gt;‘Yes, and I am afraid they will be the last this year. Poor thing! She found it hot enough, but they were so full blown, that one could not wait.’ 

&gt;‘There was no help for it certainly,’ rejoined Mrs. Norris, in a rather softened voice; ‘but I question whether her headach might not be caught then, sister. There is nothing so likely to give it as standing and stooping in a hot sun. But I dare say it will be well to-morrow. Suppose you let her have your aromatic vinegar;* I always forget to have mine filled.’ 

&gt;‘She has got it,’ said Lady Bertram; ‘she has had it ever since she came back from your house the second time.’ 

&gt;‘What!’ cried Edmund; ‘has she been walking as well as cutting roses; walking across the hot park to your house, and doing it twice, ma’am?—No wonder her head aches.’"
bookclub,"Just reading without thinking about it, it's obvious that Fanny is the protagonist, and that she's not like everyone else.  This is SO obvious, I didn't notice that Austen is at pains to establish it and keep it in mind.  It's also interesting to see Fanny's own emerging sense of what the difference is between her and everyone else.

Even before Austen give's Fanny's name, in ch 1, Mrs. Norris and Sir Bertram are talking about keeping her different:

&gt; ‘There will be some difficulty in our way, Mrs. Norris,’ observed Sir Thomas, ‘as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as they grow up; how to preserve in the minds of my *daughters* the consciousness of what they are, ...

Those crummy Mansfield daughters in their comic pride about how she knows nothing about European geography and calls is the *Island* of Wight -- that's partly to maintain/establish difference.

When her cousins go to balls: ""As to her cousins’ gaieties, she loved to hear an account of them, especially of the balls, and whom Edmund had danced with; but thought too lowly of her own situation to imagine she should ever be admitted to the same, and listened therefore without an idea of any nearer concern in them."" -- again it establishes a distance, the word ""nearer"" in negation is specifically distancing.

The steward points out how unlike Fanny Miss Crawford is in learning to ride.

Then Fanny begins to be aware herself of a difference between what she thinks and others do -- for example when the Crawford's arrive: ""she still continued to think Mr. Crawford very plain, in spite of her two cousins having repeatedly proved the contrary,""

and an example I mentioned before; Fanny's awareness that no one else sees Edmund as she does:

""She regarded her cousin as an example of every thing good and great, as possessing worth, which no one but herself could ever appreciate,""

When Sir Bertram leaves, there's an elaborated distinction between how differently the cousins and Fanny take it, then an interesting remark by *him* -- asserting that in many ways she hasn't changed, and that he thinks her brother might be disappointed.

bookclub,"In these chapters we see the first instance of Lyra losing a bit of her confidence and becoming a more passive character, which is one of the biggest complaints people have about the rest of the trilogy. It’s well-supported; the alethiometer actually tells her to give up control to Will, but she’s never actually done this before, not even with Iorek. Is this a failure on Pullman’s part, or is it realistic given that’s she’s so far out of her element (and if so, how do you reconcile her humility here with her initiative in Svalbard)?

Lyra’s sexism is interesting. In the first book, she thinks female scholars are fusty and can never hope to achieve the things that male scholars can; she dabbles in femininity with Mrs. Coulter but ultimately rejects it and takes on a bit of a gyptian identity when she meets up with the Costas. Here, she refuses to wear jeans because she’s a girl, and she’s surprised that her scholar (Dr. Malone) is a woman, but “this was a strange world, after all.” Yet she’s done remarkable things; she isn’t limited by her sex. That seems to be only for other women.

And a little thing I noticed: “…she felt hungry and bought a bar of chocolate with her twenty-pound note. The shopkeeper looked at her oddly, but he was from the Indies and didn’t understand her accent, perhaps, although she asked very clearly.” In *The Golden Compass*, it’s called *chocolatl*."
bookclub,"Fanny needs a horse for exercise; gets weary when she tries to keep up with Mrs. Norris; at the end of ch 1. her mother characterizes her as ""delicate and puny"".  

Any other indications she's more than usually weak?"
bookclub,"To prose, says wiktionary, with [one example from Keats](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/prose#Verb) is to speak dully.  (edit: related word with semantic overlap: prosaic.) 

I hadn't run across it before this line in ch. 8:

&gt; The Sotherton scheme was mentioned of course. It was hardly possible indeed that any thing else should be talked of, for Mrs. Norris was in high spirits about it, and Mrs. Rushworth, a well-meaning, civil, prosing, pompous woman, who thought nothing of consequence, but as it related to her own and her son’s concerns, had not yet given over pressing Lady Bertram to be of the party.

A stew of adjectives.  How well-meaning can you be, what does it matter how civil you are, if you think of no one else's concerns?"
bookclub,"I think this passage might be the first where Fanny consciously considers a superiority she has over the Bertram's:

&gt; She regarded her cousin as an example of every thing good and great, as possessing worth, which no one but herself could ever appreciate . . . 

Her unique power is couched in terms of humility and gratitude, so it doesn't leap off the page as a sense  of superiority, but she considers her nieces and aunts oblivious and unperceptive

At the end of same paragragh:

&gt; Her sentiments towards him were compounded of all that was respectful, grateful, confiding, and tender.

This sounds so sugar-and-everything-nice it's easy to glaze over.  But suppose we assume Austen has a point for everything she says -- this could easily be a wry comment by Austen about the limits of *Fanny's* perception -- and quite likely the reader's too.  Edmund has been presented as a delivering angel with regard to poney/mare, Austen may be commenting that like Fanny, the reader is apt to construct a  a non-human image, a character toward whom one only feels good sentiments."
bookclub,"Pages and pages of Mrs. Norris protesting how she must keep a room free for a friend, and it all ends like this:  ""every then at Mansfield wen on for some time as usual.""  -- A long false alarm -- but I think the words ""spontaneous"" and ""untaught"" are remarkable below.   Fitting in with the artless words of appreciation /u/platykurt called out -- here where there are perceived rules of conduct and demeanor for everything, Fanny retains some spontaneity reaching back to her 5-years-ago artless thanks to Edmund 

&gt; Fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her fears of a removal; and her spontaneous, untaught felicity on the discovery, conveyed some consolation to Edmund for his disappointment in what he had expected to be so essentially serviceable to her. Mrs. Norris took possession of the White house, the Grants arrived at the parsonage, and these events over, every thing at Mansfield went on for some time as usual.


"
bookclub,"Mansfield Park is probably built on wealth gained from slavery; I completely missed this when I first read it, but Austen deliberately sets it up -- in Ch 3, Sir Bertram has to leave on business there.  There's no consensus reading of what Austen's point was.

Here's a spoiler-free overview: 

&gt; Mansfield Park takes its slavery context from the time period in which is it set.  The novel is set in the early 1800s, when the abolitionist movement was really gaining some steam.  While slavery doesn’t take a central role in Mansfield Park, much of the action occurs due to the fact that Sir Thomas Bertram spends two years in Antigua on urgent business.  This urgent business is vague in its nature, but Austen gives readers some information with statements about the “poor returns” from the Antiguan property and that “a large part of his income was unsettled.” Readers are left to sort out for themselves the causes and solutions of these financial problems.

"
bookclub,"See part 1 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/715txx/good_omens_british_references?sort=new).   Potential spoilers through to the end of the book. As before, there shouldn't be anything too spoiler-ish but just in case."
bookclub,"Chapter I.1 and I.2 seem full of facts, and establish a back story, but I feel there's something structurally unsatisfying about them.  While Fanny is clearly the candidate for protagonist or sympathetic character, nothing much is told from her point of view.  /u/surf_wax mentioned that she goes from the oldest to youngest in moving  from one place to another, but that experience of hers doesn't spring out in any vivid detail.  The most vivid thing is crying while she ate the gooseberry tart and that seemed to me to not be highlighted.  There's a passage before Edmund gives her paper (Ch. 2 ""The grandeur of the house astonished...."") about her inner reaction, but it's logical/expository, not dramatic or moving.

The bit where Julia and Maria are commenting on her ignorance of geography is  amusing but goes on at some length.

/u/zoot-just_zoot commented on the leisurely pace -- I feel it here as a fault

The following seems like almost a placeholder piece of writing to me... realistic but drab, and imposed by the mistake of starting the novel before the real story begins:

&gt; Fanny, with all her faults of ignorance and timidity, was fixed at Mansfield Park, and learning to transfer in its favour much of her attachment to her former home, grew up there not unhappily among her cousins.

On the other hand, it *is* psychologically realistic  -- from trauma you *do* fall into routine, and ""not unhappily"" is perhaps a more barbed observation than it appears.
"
bookclub,"Did anyone else notice that Fanny had some issues that might appear to be biographical for the author? Or, at least, Fanny seems to share some of the laments that a lot of authors do including one problem that is very fundamental - having something to write on.

In chapter 1.2 she desperately wants to write to her brother but - guess what? - ""she had not any paper"".  I immediately said uh oh, better watch out for this authorial dynamic as we go.

On  the next page [15] we stay on the issue reading that, ""Fanny's feeling on the occasion were such as she believed herself incapable of expressing."" The narrator goes on to refer to ""a few artless words."" The book seems to be touching on the difficult gap between thought and expression that is so important in literature.

It's also interesting to note that a man had to provide Fanny the inspiration and supplies to start writing. And, further, a man had to finance the postage just to send the letter out."
bookclub,"People mentioned some confusion about the titles/addresses of the various Ward sisters.  

I don't know anywhere these conventions are spelled out, but basically I think the eldest children are Mr. and Miss.  In some books the 2nd eldest male is called ""Master"", I don't know if that comes up in MP.   Anyone know a good reference or guidelines for this?  (Maybe an old etiquette book?)

There's some more confusing stuff that comes up when Mr. and Miss Crawford comes to hang out with the Grants and they're talking about the Grant family -- Mary Crawford and Mrs. Grant at step sisters and the way they talk about relations I didn't follow."
bookclub,"I always assumed I'd look to the foster system for my kids, if I had them, and while I haven't done anything beyond attending a few classes, I have read an enormous amount on the behavior and psychology of foster kids. Fanny's situation is in many ways analogous to a modern foster child's situation: she is removed from her home, separated from her siblings, her benefactors don't understand why she isn't happy or grateful, and everyone is determined to treat her differently from the biological children in the house.

I was very surprised that Jane Austen got her reaction down so well. Check this out, in Chapter 1.2:

&gt; ""Mrs. Norris had been talking to her the whole way from Northampton of her wonderful good fortune, and the extraordinary degree of gratitude and good behavior which it ought to produce, and her consciousness of misery was therefore increased by the idea of its being a wicked thing for her not to be happy.""

Damn, Jane. I was never in foster care, but I am an adoptee, and that is spot re: a situation I never really expected Austen to understand. Fanny has just been removed from her home, which is not as nice, but (as Edmund realizes later) is still her home. She's been thrust into the arms of family she's never met, she doesn't understand how to behave around them, she's told how she ought to feel, and she's been downgraded from oldest girl to youngest child altogether, so even the family dynamic has changed. All the attention is on her, and they've already found her wanting. And she's supposed to be *grateful?*

In real life, Fanny's lack of any meaningful control over her surroundings might result in worse behavior; kids suffering trauma (as Fanny is, by being separated from her family) will often act out in ways to minimize that trauma, sometimes by wresting control back with misbehavior. This tends to get worse the older they get, and the more times they're moved. Most foster parent literature advises the FP to allow the child a semblance of age-appropriate control, such as room decor, choice of meals, activities, etc., but these kids (and Fanny) are grieving, and that grief often comes out in ways that caretakers don't like. That is not to say that foster kids are *bad*, just that most of them have a lot of heavy baggage to carry around, particularly when the trauma is fresh or unresolved.

I also wonder, at this point in the novel, whether her family has done her at all a service by bringing her to live with them. Money isn't everything. Separation from one's family can have long-lasting effects, and their desire to bring her up in a higher class while not actually making her a real member of it seems to me that it would set her up for disappointment later, when she marries into a lower class than what she's grown up accustomed to. Or on the off chance that she gets to keep her position, is it better for her than not being traumatized by leaving her family would have been? She loses years with her siblings and parents, and sees William only once."
bookclub,"For US readers anyway, all three HDM ebooks are $1.99 today

seee r/ebookdeals for others, unusually good day for discount ereader literary fiction "
bookclub,"On how Mrs. Norris drive a wedge between Mrs. Price and the Huntington part of the family: ""Mrs. Norris had a spirit of activity"" and ""Mrs. Norris could not possibly keep to herself"" -- these restrained, sly ways of saying ""she was a busybody, meddling and spiteful"" pop out to me.  Contrast them with her own self-image.

One thing I don't see much of, throughout, is how anyone *else* regards Mrs. Norris -- even Edmund later on regards her as proper company for Fanny."
bookclub,"I would say that in the long run, MP is *not* mostly about marriage.  But the plot driver of the first pages concentrate on the marriage and its effect on extended family.  In particular Frances Ward (Fanny's mother) marries below her social class and that gives *opportunity* for the Mrs. Norris (Fanny's younger aunt, who never gets a first name), to break the family apart.

There's not really any observation that Julia Ward marrying *above* her station causes a misfortune, or that Sir Bertram could ""disoblige"" *his* family.

But marriage is the background to the plot setup, and the explicit treatment of it being a matter of public concern (all Huntington has an opinion, and all their acquaintances speculate on the marriages of  the other two sisters, first page), and a financial arrangement."
bookclub,"I never noticed it before, but this is an interesting way to get rid of a narrative-complicating parent: have her child leave her in someone’s safekeeping. So many stories rely on unaccompanied minors, and usually the situation is entirely out of their control: Lyra’s parents basically abandoned her to Jordan College; the Pevensies were evacuated from London during WWII; Harry Potter’s parents were killed by Voldemort; Mowgli’s parents were killed by Shere Khan. Will, on the other hand, takes the initiative and sees his mother off. He has more control and maturity (and free *will*, maybe) than most kids in fantasy stories, including Lyra. But he’s still a child; he flees, thinking he’s committed a murder (and the alethiometer concurs, oddly — that never made sense to me). He’s very clearly out of his element.

In Chapter 2, we get a bit of a primer on the direction the story is taking. We find out from the tortured witch that Lyra, or her role, isn’t new to their time: “She is the one who came before, and you have hated and feared her ever since!” (Those of us who have read the book before know what her role was, making this quote doubly interesting.) Thorold, Lord Asriel’s manservant, educates Serafina Pekkala on the Church and its history. We learn from him that Lord Asriel intends to kill God, and we hear about the ancient war between the heavens—the first time that Pullman ties the story to *Paradise Lost*, outside the epigraph that begins *The Golden Compass*.

That said, the second chapter doesn’t really hold up in a narrative sense, when you know a storyteller’s tricks. It’s a lot of setup and not particularly interesting. We’ve seen expositionary chapters before, notably the last section of Chapter 1 of *The Golden Compass*, where the Master and the Librarian talk and then we never hear from them again. Overall I still think the books are excellent and well-constructed, but I can see the shadow of the man behind the curtain this time, too.

What are your thoughts?"
bookclub,"I'm told that ""Fanny"" has, in England, come to refer to the exterior processes of the the female organs of generation, much as ""Dick"" in all English-speaking lands of which I am aware, refers to the male counterpart.  When I read a book with a character named ""Dick"", I don't think of anatomy.  Query: thou English readers -- is ""fanny"" a vulgar term, and does it distract when you read a novel such as MP with a character so-named?

Erica Jong wrote a novel called ""Fanny"" where the heroine was the counterpart to Tom Jones; I imagine she chose the name leeringly."
bookclub,"**Intros, what are you looking for?** If you'll be reading Mansfield Park with us, introduce yourself here.  Have you read Austen before?  Is there anything in particular you like or dislike about her work?  What brings you here? 

I nominated the book because it's one of the seven works treated in Nabokov's Lectures on Literature (which I  haven't read), so I might drag in similarities differences to some of those -- they are Jeckyl  &amp; Hyde; Ulysses; Bleak House; Bovary; Swann's Way; and the Metamorphosis (Kafka, not Metamorpho**ses** by Ovid mentioned below -- all but Bleak House and Jeckyl and Hyde have  previously been r/bookclub selections.

bookclub,"First [scheduled discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/72jsxd/mansfield_park_schedule/) is not til Monday, but here a
couple non-story specific points -- as always, you can post about
any part of the work at any time.


""Mr. Rushworth was returned with his head full of the subject, and
very eager to be improving his own place in the same way, and though
not saying much to the purpose, could talk of nothing else""

That dig about him being both voluble and vacuous, stated 
with polite phrasing, to me exemplifies the very most noticeable 
Austen style.


"" It was hardly possible, indeed, that anything else should be talked
of, for Mrs. Norris was in high spirits about it; and Mrs. Rushworth,
a well–meaning, civil, prosing, pompous woman, who thought nothing of
consequence, but as it related to her own and her son’s concerns, had
not yet given over pressing Lady Bertram to be of the party.""

Many times examples of long sentences really come down to lists or
simply joined sentences.  The syntax of this (not remarkably long)
sentence shows organization of thought more complex than often seen in
writers whose prose is praised today: The subject main clause ""it
wasn't possible"" -- first modifier: ""because ... Mrs Rushworth..."".
Second modifier: ""who thought nothing"", third modifier, modifying her
thinking: ""but as it related"".  Nevertheless, the sentence as a whole
is tightly focused to discuss why the subject of conversation didn't
change."
bookclub,"This post is part of [this series](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/734miz/short_reads_11001_eliot_on_blake/); see below about formatting poetry.


What are examples of what Eliot means here, about B's early poems: 

&gt; The Songs of Innocence and of Experience, and the poems from the Rossetti manuscript, are the poems of a man with a profound interest in human emotions, and a profound knowledge of them. The emotions are presented in an extremely simplified, abstract form. This form is one illustration of the eternal struggle of art against education, of the literary artist against the continuous deterioration of language.

Part of *Eliot's* rhetoric and style in this is  to assume that the reader is so conversant with the work discussed that examples would be superfluous.   

What are examples of ""abstract"" presentation?  Maybe he doesn't mean ""as opposed to concrete"" but ""derived, extracted"" (the first adjectival meaning at wiktionary, but they tag it obsolete)

""Joy"" is an abstraction -- 

**Infant Joy**

‘I have no name:  
I am but two days old.’  
What shall I call thee?  
‘I happy am,  
Joy is my name.’  
Sweet joy befall thee!  

Pretty joy!  
Sweet joy, but two days old.  
Sweet joy I call thee:  
Thou dost smile,  
I sing the while,  
Sweet joy befall thee!  

I didn't know what the Rosetti Manuscript was; there are a lot of facsimile copies on the net but I'm still looking for a tidy text copy.

bookclub,"Borges keeps knocking me over with these concepts, because a lot of them sound like they could come from my own head. I’ve always been super into tracking and data and algorithms, to a somewhat obsessive extent… you should see the logic for the iTunes smart playlists I’ve set up. I’d give my left leg for a CSV of Amazon’s or Goodreads’s database — not the customer information, but the products — so I could run queries on it and find out all sorts of cool things.

In short, I’m a little bit into data, and this story made an amazing amount of sense to me. In this case, the problem is that the data owner (Funes) has an extremely large amount of data and the possibilities for aggregating it are endless. He doesn’t know what to do with it. He comes up with this ridiculous, nonsensical system that makes perfect sense to *him* because he has the ultimate eidetic memory. He’s a database.

If you were able to access Funes and run queries on the actual data, though, you could find out lots of neat stuff. Borges says at one point that he remembers every leaf on every tree; imagine the scientific insights you could make if you had a recording device like Funes. You could save dead languages and their pronunciation with minimal effort; all you’d need was his willingness, and then you could feed him a “program” to extract and transform the data. But he can’t think for himself. Borges notes, “I suspect, nevertheless, that he was not very capable of thought.” He’s like a computer. (I wonder what Borges would think of our data-driven society? He died in 1986.)"

interest in **Magic Mountain**

Accumulator has the full **Rememberance of things Past/In Search

Also accumulator has **The Divine Comedy**, which I'm also a bit wary of, but maybe alongside something like ""Idiot's guide to Aquinas"" (taking wikipedia's word that DC is sometimes called ""*Summa* in verse"") and an inspired read-runner it could be great.

We've brought up idea of reading a few books (from the 20+) in Zola's

Maybe in large part, that's because for years there was a Gutenberg selection every month, which pushed the sub toward classics.

**Discussion of previous selections** is always welcome here, and [here's the list](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/wiki/previous) of those.  It's fine to just post about about a specific scene in some book we read years ago -- though you don't see a lot of examples, that's something I want  to encourage. 

We're voting now -- [here's the voting thread](https://redd.it/712095)

If you have questions/suggestions -- post them in this thread, or start a new one -- unsolicited ""meta"" threads are always welcome here.

**Poetry** This spring, I was trying an every-ten-days poetry series -- With new users coming thru, I wondered if there's any interest in continuing this -- here's the [previous poetry posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/search?q=flair%3ALBSOSLP&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)"

bookclub,"

Always a bridesmaid . . . Jane Austen has been nominated many times
but never selected for a Bookclub read, and no one gets as many downvotes.

Still, tomorrow in the nomination thread, I'm going to nominate Mansfield Park.

Why Mansfield Park?  At some point, I'd like to see this sub undertake
a Big-big-big read, of Nabokov's lectures on literature and the seven
subject novels.  Four of the seven have been previously selected:
Ulysses, Swann's Way, Madame Bovary and Metamorposis.  Mansfield Park,
Jeckyll and Hyde, and Bleak House are the three left.  Jekyll and Hyde
we can knock off easily; Bleak House and Mansfield Park will probably
be harder to pitch as a standalones here.  If you're an Austen-hater,
odds are you're an admirer of Nabokov and might be intrigued by the fact
that *he* came over to being an admirer of her craft upon attentive reading.

Austen's gentle/wry/knowing tone, and obvious hypocrisy highlighted by
not-so-subtle phrasing -- which I think is what people don't like,
even when they say they don't like the preoccupation with marriage --
that typical Austen tone is strong in this one.  But the plotting is elaborate,
and the attention not soley on marriage."

(read about [Campaign] posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/6thwlk/three_no_four_new_initiatives_three_at_the_usual/))

In Tuesday's selection thread, I'm going to nominate *Money* by Martin Amis.


It's 368 pages, from 1984, the first of three connected novels, the
""London Trilogy"". *Money* starts with a confrontation with a racist
New York cabbie.  The narrator's voice is negative, and inclined to
follow thoughts into silly terrain:

&gt; Fear walks tall on this planet. Fear walks big and fat and
fine. Fear has really got the whammy on all of us down here. Oh it's
true, man. Sister, don't kid yourself ... One of these days I'm going
to walk right up to fear. I'm going to walk right up.  Someone's got
to do it.. . . . Bullies, I'm told, are all cowards deep down. Fear is a
bully, but something tells me that fear is no funker. Fear, I suspect,
is really incredibly brave. Fear will lead me straight through the
door, will prop me up in the alley among the crates and the empties,
and show me who's the boss... I might lose a tooth or two, I suppose,
or he could even break my arm — or fuck up my eye!

Later: 

&gt; My theory is - we don't really go that far into other people, even
  when we think we do. We hardly ever go in and bring them out. We
  just stand at the jaws of the cave, and strike a match, and quickly
  ask if anybody's there.

The plot is about a whoring, hard-drinking, advertising director
working on a film, and involved in some twisted love quadrangle.

Amis is one of the most highly praised and best-known contemporary
novelists; he also likes to embroil himself in controversy, insulting
prominent public figures -- I thought of him in the course of reading
an article about the Booker prizes where someone said he's managed to
piss off the Booker admins, so never gets shortlisted.

r/Bookclub has never selected anything by Martin Amis (or by his
father, another famous novelist).
"
bookclub,"All right, let's start up with HDM again in a few weeks. I've scheduled the remaining two books out on Thursdays and Sundays, and tried where I could to make the Thursday sections shorter and the Sunday sections longer. It was easier to do with *The Amber Spyglass*. Then we'll read the three companion stories over the next three weeks. I've kept Thanksgiving, Christmas, and the first and last nights of Hanukkah in mind, so we have some extra/flexible time around both of those holidays.

At this point in the series, starting with the last couple chapters of *The Golden Compass*, we get deeper into Christian theology and *Paradise Lost*, which I'm excited about. There's also a fair bit to criticize. I know that in this sub we often assume the best of the author, but I think that looking critically at the last book especially might help us learn what doesn't work in a good story, and how to talk about it.

I am gone on a business trip for next week and on mobile only, so aside from short comments, I will see you all on the 23rd. Enjoy *Good Omens*!"
bookclub,"Hey, everyone! This is the scheduled post for Good Omens. By this point, we should have read all of Wednesday and Thursday. 

So tell me: What do you think so far? What interests you? What upsets you? 

Any significant parts of the story that we should have noticed by this point?"
bookclub,"Striking similes aren't a major feature but of DQ but at the end of chapter 58, one strikes:  the drovers can't hear his indignant challenge after he, Sancho, Rocinante and the gray were just about stampeded:""But not even this could stop the speeding runners, and they paid no more attention to his threats than to the clouds of yesteryear.""  

That's a good capture of the airiness and loftiness of his project and the relevance it has to the real world.  It's in the context of just having encountered the rich folks recreating arcadia in luxurious shepherd costumes.

It's also an example of language failing a character: no one can hear him as his protests express a profoundly held sentiment.  "
bookclub,"I was ready to scrap the project, but thanks to /u/isupportrugbyhookers and /u/oryx85, I'm going to keep us going... just on a more relaxed, more frequent schedule and not racing to finish before the new book is out. I also have a business trip coming up in a week, so I am going to postpone reading and discussion of the rest of the series until early October, when I'm back and will have my computer available. That new schedule will go up soon.

Thanks for your patience with me while I'm learning how to read run effectively. It's more difficult than I thought!"
bookclub,"That was quick, thanks for joining! Hope you will post your thoughts on the book. I've included a few quotes as potential prompts below.

""Inside of every American, I don't care how decayed, is a scrawny, twanging old futz like me, who hates crooks and weaklings even more than I do."" [p215] I think there is some truth to that although maybe that sensibility has lessened a bit over the last few decades.

""'The Madison Avenue people have made us all more alarmed abut our own armpits than about Russia, China, and Cuba combined.'"" [p221] Ah yes, the advertising age.

""The thing was that Earth was the only place in the whole known Universe where language was used. It was a unique Earthling invention. Everybody else used mental telepathy..."" [p249] I got a kick out of this snip which is an interesting take on the philosophy of language, or something.

""The most contemptible man in town, should his contemptible house catch fire, will see his enemies put the fire out."" [p265] This quote seems to capture the essence of Vonnegut's world view.

Hi, everyone. I have noticed that the Golden Compass posts got very little discussion, and zero responses in yesterday's scheduled post. Would anyone like to go on to The Subtle Knife, or shall we call it a day?"

bookclub,"Our third week on *The Golden Compass*, and we're at an end. Via Lord Asriel's conversation with Lyra at the end of the book, Pullman soundly connects the story to Christianity and the concept of original sin; in fact, the whole trilogy is a retelling of John Milton's *Paradise Lost*, and I wouldn't be surprised if he took some inspiration from William Blake and other poets of the time as well.

His take on the concept is what made the books so quietly subversive. They are far more blasphemous than the Harry Potter series, and have met with far less resistance. In *His Dark Materials*, Lyra and Pantalaimon stumble across the idea that Dust, a clear literary metaphor for original sin, is good, and they decide that they ought to go and preserve it. This is different from *Paradise Lost*, in which original sin is, as I understand it, soundly condemned; like Lyra, Pullman comes down on the side of experience and free will, and makes an argument against the tyranny of dogma. (Incidentally, anyone not offended by this might enjoy his take on the gospel, *The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ*. No dæmons or other worlds in that one, alas.)

Reading this as an adult, now, the Christian allegory is what fascinates me the most. Pullman said back in the 90s that ""There are some themes, some subjects too large for adult fiction"" ([source](https://books.google.com/books?id=SN2mBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)) and I think he's right; there was a big to-do about *The DaVinci Code* and all that said was that Jesus had siblings. Pullman is celebrating, here, our *original separation from God*, and in the subsequent novels, he goes even further, though I won't spoil it here. How would that have fared in an adult novel, without metaphors and allegories?

What are your thoughts on the end of the novel, or the novel as a whole? Also, basically anyone probably has keener insight into the religious themes than I do; I'd love to hear what others have to say.

Also, these discussions have been relatively sparse -- are people interested in going on to *The Subtle Knife* and *The Amber Spyglass*? I feel a bit like I'm shouting into the void but I'll keep shouting if there are people following along. Leave me a comment or send me a PM if you're into it."
bookclub,"You guys, we did it! We finished it! This amazing epic novel that has been in our lives since late June now gets to retire to our bookcases, and if anyone asks, we can look all smug and say, ""Of course I read it.""

Cervantes was getting kind of old at the time the second part of DQ was published, and he died the following year. According to Wikipedia, he had type 2 diabetes and was probably ailing for awhile. I'm no DQ scholar, but I wonder if some of the way he wrapped up the novel was because he was trying to get his affairs in order. There is a significant amount about the unauthorized Part II, which seems to have deeply upset him (understandably). Like Arthur Conan Doyle a couple hundred years later, he ends the possibility of more ""canon"" works with the death of his main character (though Sherlock got resurrected, and I'm not sure what Cervantes's aim was).

DQ also emerges from his madness! I was surprised when that happened, and I still don't know how I feel about it. He had a grand adventure, and he specifically says to his niece that his only regret was that he couldn't read more books to recalibrate himself to reality. I can't help putting myself in that situation, though, sudden lucidity on my deathbed after years of madness, and the thought is frightening -- it would make the years prior seem like such a waste and an embarrassment. DQ's great legacy is as a laughingstock, and I see now why Nabokov was so angry with Cervantes for mistreating him; the second half of the book is kind of heartbreaking, considering the tricks played on him and the *Flowers for Algernon*-like awakening that he must have had, realizing that many of his friends were not actually his friends.

bookclub,"Money is a sign of modernity, unromantic, foreign to the chivalrous impulse -- a few notes

The most striking mention of money is in chapter II.XXIII -- When he is in the cave of Montesinos (which is you can [still visit](https://www.cuevademontesinos.es/), one of the enchanted Dulcinea's enchanted ladies-in-(enchanted-)waiting comes to Don Q and asks him for the loan of 6 *reales*, with some of her underwear as a security.

This wanting to borrow money surprised me as much as it surprised Don Quixote, who is astounded that enchanted people need money; yes, Montesinos tells him, it's needed everywhere.

Quixote typically doesn't handle money -- in the cave, he only had 4 *reales* because he'd asked Sancho for it so that he might give alms while on the road.  He showed no interest in the money in the abandoned saddlebags back in book I, and told then inkeepers that knights don't carry money.  

Later on in Book II, when he is with Roque the bandit, Roque makes some remark about having to convert leftover loot to money in order to share it out equally.  
"
bookclub,"Sansón Carrasco has returned, and this time he manages to get the better of poor Don Quixote, who is forced, on his honor as a knight errant, to acquiesce to his demands that he return home and sit around for a year before taking up his armor and lance again.

As mentioned before, I think a lot of the story is not about DQ but about people’s reactions to him — but I’m not sure that’s the case here. No one has been able to get through his madness or to stop him, despite all manner of violence and trickery, until now.

So it’s not everyone else’s reactions the spotlight is on now, it’s DQ’s. What do you think of how he responds to the order to give up his travels? Is it in keeping with his character, or does some sanity manage to poke through? Are you surprised by the plans he makes? And what about Sancho?"
bookclub,"On p135 there is a scene that has a lot to say about the nature of economic transactions:

""They tried to be cynical about what he sold, but they knew in their hearts that he was offering the only get-rich-quick scheme that was open to them: to insure themselves and die soon.""

""Lila thought that maybe it was a vitamin deficiency..."" [p158] Somewhat curiously, there was also a concern expressed about vitamin deficiency in the Atwood novel we read recently.

""That's all over, men working with their hands and backs. They are not needed."" [p 185] This lament seems even more prevalent today with the increase in automation.

""*scree-scraw, scree-scraw*"" [p187] I laughed at this bit of onomatopoeia. Classic Vonnegut imho.

There are a couple more key quotes toward the end of chapter eleven but I think we can get to them in the threads."
bookclub,"This is what *really* grabbed me the first time I read *The Golden Compass*. It's the ultimate personality test, better than the sorting hat -- what would your dæmon settle as?

In Chapter 10 we hear a bit of an explanation about why dæmons take the forms they do. Jerry the sailor says of his: ""Take old Belisaria. She's a seagull, and that means i'm a kind of seagull too. I'm not grand and splendid nor beautiful, but I'm a tough old thing and I can survive anywhere and always find a bit of food and company. That's worth knowing, that is. And when your dæmon settles, you'll know the sort of person you are.""

It struck me that this must rely on cultural beliefs about animals and what they symbolize. I don't think there's been a coyote dæmon in the whole series, so I'll use that as an example: you've got an animal that can be seen as both a resourceful, beautiful, pack-oriented animal that can survive anything and has a beautiful singing voice, and also as a filthy, mangy, pet-eating pest that carries rabies. Would a white sheep farmer with a coyote dæmon be a very different person from a Navajo silversmith, also with a coyote dæmon? Or look at how attitudes have changed about wolves in the past 50-100 years. Is a 15-year-old with a wolf dæmon similar to a 70-year-old with a wolf dæmon?

Also, it's mentioned early on that servants have dog dæmons. Is it because they have to have deferential personalities to succeed as servants? Does being born into the trade shape their personalities and expectations such that a dog dæmon is inevitable? Are dogs seen as subservient *because* servants tend to have them as dæmons -- like did human personalities and dæmon forms inform the symbolism assigned to the animal? (Did the author just not think it through? That seems way less complicated.)

If it is a matter of what the animals symbolize, how does that choice get made? I have theories, but I think I'll save them until the end of *The Amber Spyglass*. If you want to talk about that in here, please use spoiler tags!

And, the fun question: What do you think your dæmon would be, and why? You must have thought about it at some point."
bookclub,"This is later than I’d have liked to post it, but it is so hot that I’ve been avoiding being at home reading, or being on the computer.

Anyway, something I’ve been watching is how Pullman constructs the big reveal at the end of Chapter 12. (“That was *intercision*, and this was a severed child.”) He has to do a lot of work, because the idea of dæmons is completely alien to his readers, but the emotional impact of the reveal is dependent on his skill at showing us how important and essential they are. He does this in a number of clever ways:

* Pantalaimon and Lyra testing the separation earlier in this section, while Iorek watches, and the description of what it feels like for Lyra — the physical pain, but more importantly the emotional pain
* Farder Coram’s description of seeing Serafina Pekkala without her dæmon and the horror that this brought to the people listening to the story
* Iorek telling Lyra that his armor is like his soul, and how making crappy iron would be like replacing Pantalaimon with a stuffed doll (which was a bit of foreshadowing I’d never caught before, too)
* The trick Lyra played on the scholars’ skulls, switching their dæmon coins around — I think this was carefully planted earlier and then deliberately recalled at the end of Chapter 12, when they were about to go into the shed and Pantalaimon lost his nerve
* So many other little things I never noted. It’s made abundantly clear, in only 200-some pages of story while they’re seemingly relegated to the background (most are never named, if they’re described it’s often as a corrollary to the person), that dæmons are people’s *souls*, and that they’re not human without them

I admit I didn’t absorb a lot of this at twelve years old, and missed the full emotional gut-punch of the last paragraph of Chapter 12, but now, knowing what it is and watching the setup and reading for more than neat talking animals, it doesn’t fail to grab me. And it holds me. While we’re still recovering from it, Lyra talks to the boy, who asks her, “You got my Ratter?” And if that question isn’t heartbreaking enough, and if that name isn’t familiar, she asks his name, and we realize it was the same boy that we met way back in Chapter 2, before we knew who Mrs. Coulter was. So we’ve got an emotional connection to this character as well.

This whole part is just so devastating, and I’m in wonder at how Pullman is able to make it that way with a concept of his own invention. Flippin wild, you guys.

What have you noticed about this section?"
bookclub,"Hey guys, sorry I haven't posted a schedule yet. I've been horribly sick. 

Regardless, here is the schedule. I figure we will keep it fairly straight forward. I have the e-book, so I am going off of that. It looks like it's broken up until five sections with one being exceptionally short and another being longer. So I'm going off of that. 

* **9/9/17** - End of ""Eleven Years Ago""
* **9/16/17** - End of ""Thursday"" (So read ""Wednesday"" and ""Thursday"" this week)

[Marginalia](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/6ypv5v/good_omens_marginalia/)"
bookclub,"With Sancho installed as governor, Don Quixote plans to head for Zaragoza to engage in chivalric contests.
This plan gets interrupted because Don Q. discoveries that in the false
Second Part of Don Quixote the protagonist visits Zaragoza; Don Q therefor
instead travels to Barcelona, to prove that the Aragonese version of
the book is by a liar.

And he's accompanied by Sancho, who walked away from his governorship
after one successful mock battle, because, he says, the duties of
governor didn't sit well on his ribs.

---

In this section, the mood begins to darken.  Bumping into dangling
feet while wandering a wood at night, which feet belong to hanged
highwaymen is the most lurid example; there is also the encounter with
Sancho's old neighbor, a moor whose family has been expelled from
Spain.  The language in one notable place turns to outright sarcasm:
just before he is run over by a great train of cattle the narrator
refers to ""Fortune, who was directing his affairs from one success to
another.""

There is also a change in suddenly giving an account of Quixote as
distressed and anxious, and bringing the point of view into his interior
thoughts; this is at the beginning of chapter 60.  This language
about  the limits of the source prefaces the passage, and sets it
off-the-track:

&gt; .... in more than six days nothing occurred that was worth
recording, but then, at the end of that time, when he had wandered
away from the road, night overtook him in a thick stand of oak or cork
trees; in this instance, Cide Hamete does not honor the exactitude he
usually observes in such matters.

That is immediately followed by close inspection of DQ's thouhts, even
including quoted passages of him talking to himself, resenting Sancho's
failure to scourge himself and free Dulcinea.  Then Sancho fights back,
giving lie to the fiction of his subservience. And immediately after,
they begin bumping into theives' feet.

-----------

There were two comic moments I want to note:  One is the inkeeper,
a glutton like Sancho, talking to Sancho about the coarse meal they
will soon share:

&gt; “What I really and truly have are two cows’ heels that seem like calves’ feet, or two calves’ feet that seem like cows’ heels; they’re stewed with chickpeas, onions, and bacon, and right now they’re saying, ‘Eat me! Eat me!’”

The cartoonish vivid enthusiasm sparkles.

And when Altisidora is cursing Don Q. for ignoring her, her parting curses
descent rapidly from high moral language to wishing bad luck at cards and bodily indignities (loose
lineation): 

&gt; May you be known as false-hearted from Sevilla to Marchena,  
from Granada to far Loja,  
from fair London throughout England.  
If you ever play reinado,  
los cientos, or la primera,  
may all the kings fly from you,  
as well as aces and sevens.  
If you ever trim your corns,  
may the blood spurt from the wounds,  
and if you have your molars pulled  
may they break off at the roots.  

--------

There's a lot more in this passage, especially with the narrative
gaining more an more self-consciousness.  If there are any passages
you want to call out, comment on this thread or start a new one.
"
bookclub,"Ok, 1st time posting (or even being in a book club).

What I enjoy about Vonnegut is his timelessness; Rosewater was published in 1965 and so much is still relevant fifty+ years later and this chapter really hits on that.
 
Samaritrophia, he defined, is hysterical indifference to the troubles of those less fortunate than oneself, which is why Sylvia had a mental breakdown. The only cure the doctor has is to lock away her conscience, to only occasionally open the door to hear the faint cries of the prisoner within, to show there is still some humanity in her. 

I respect KV takes care not to specifically label this as an 'upper class' malady. He keeps it in context of humankind in general and I don't think Samaritrophia is a bad thing, per se. 

There is little we 'simple folk' can do for the millions that charities, media, celebrities pushes us to care about. However, those who control so much wealth, who have it in them to give, need to protect their own self-interests, which is what the Senator and others in Rosewater's social level don't necessarily understand Elliot's passion. 

The Senator says 'If Elliot's booze were cut off, his compassion for the maggots in the bottom of the slime on the bottom of the human garbage pail would collapse.'

The two striking facts about the Senator are a) he's a senator and b) he's generational rich. 

So not only is KV making a statement about inherited wealth but also 60's politics. How relevant is that still today? 

Now on to current events; because Rosewater is in USA let's talk Houston. Yesterday, many media outlets reported on all the 'donations' celebrities were making to Houston flood relief; I heard many were donating $25K and challenging other celebrities to match that. Now 25K is a lot to us, but to it is really the equivalent of them digging in their pockets for spare change. Plus its tax deductible (and I could easily imagine this might be the most the US govt allows for tax purposes but i could be wrong - not American). 

Don't most of us suffer from 'samaritrophia'? Do we (or politicians) really care about those people? Not unless we are in the flood zone or have something personal at stake. Asking for donations is simply an act of 'shaming' people with samaritrophia in an effort to deny its existence. 

Elliot Rosewater is helping the poor because he wants to help the poor. John Steinbeck has a great quote in Grapes of Wrath about how when in times of trouble, turn to the poor, because they are the only ones who will truly help. For whatever reason, samaritrophia is still an upper class disease because they are the people who can most limit the suffering but as he said earlier in the book, America is about grabbing as much as you can or you will get nothing. 

I believe Elliot achieves that compassionate humanity through his drinking. I think this is also why he respects volunteer firemen on one level; they care about others they have no personal (read; paid) interest in. 

Samaritrophia is alive and well in today's society and always will be, for in the end, we all need to take care of ourselves first. 

So is KV criticizing it or merely creating a definition for us to identify with?
Thanks for reading.  "
bookclub,"Do you have a favorite insult in the book?

For some reason, melodramatic literary insults make me laugh. In Dead Souls my favorite was ""you're a drunken cobbler!""

So far in DQ it's ""You garlic stuffed scoundrel!"""
bookclub,"In Chapter 7, after the airplane ride -- with it's brief glimpse of
forgotten before-the-train time and ""all the mysteries of life were answered"" (p 85),
the narrative plunges senselessly into the story of the horrible Eddie
Sauer (some kind of dinosaur joke?) who briefly tries wooing the
sensitive-nosed Claire Thompson *nee* Shook.

It includes a pair of sentences I love:

&gt; The town of Noxon lay on the south side of the Clark Fork River
and the widow’s house lay on the north, so they didn’t get a chance
even to stop over at the store for a soda, but pulled up into Claire’s
front yard and emptied the house and loaded as many of her worldly
possessions onto the wagon as the horses would pull, mostly heavy
locked trunks, tools, and kitchen gear, heaping the rest aboard the
Model T and creating a pile as high up as a man could reach with a
hoe, and at the pinnacle two mattresses and two children, also a little
dog. By the time Grainier noticed them, the children were too far
above him to distinguish their age or sexual type. 

That first sentence is heaped as high as the Ford -- ""also a little
dog"" is such a great dangling touch to the heaped-up-high sentence;
and ""and high as a man could reach with a hoe"" is so piercingly exact
and appropriate in the image and diction.  Then that next sentence:
""sexual type"" -- what a weird thing to say, and the fancy word
""distinguish"" -- instead of ""he couldn't tell if they were boys or
girls.""  The fact of them being too far to distinguish re-emphasises
the distance.  The language makes the children like scientific 
curiosities -- curiosities he's not interested in, though.

But what is the point of Eddie and Claire?  Is it modulating into the spell of lust in chapter 9?"
bookclub,"From chapter XLV to LII of part II, Sancho is in his ""insula"", while
Don Q. is with the Duke and Duchess and one chapter takes us
back to Sancha's village.  The alternation of scene breaks up
the narrative, so, while it is still one-thing-after-another,
there's a more rapid shift of mood and tone, and these chapters seem
to move more quickly than others.

Here are some points that struck me; conversation welcome on any of these points, or any other aspect of the book up to this point -- either as comments here, or you can start a new top-level thread.

Installed as Governor in Ch XLV, Sancho plays two gimmicky tricks to
see ""catch"" wrongdoers/false accusers, which seem like oft-told-tales,
old chestnuts that Cervantes probably heard elsewhere.

Ch XLVI is about ""belline and feline"" adventure -- I didn't follow the
joke about belline; belline is a silly made-up word by Cervantes, and
some people translate ""feline"" ""catine"", apparently that's also a
nonce- word in the original; ""belline"" refers to the bell tied to the
cat's tail.  

A line I liked -- the vigorous make-the-bestism of Sancho in the
face of the doctor who denies him delicacies:

&gt; “That big bowl steaming over there looks to me like olla podrida, and because
those stews have so many different kinds of things in them, I can’t
help but come across something that I’ll like and that will be good
for me.” (XLVII)

In that same chapter is the account by the farmer looking for a
marriage present for his boy, who is in love with a woman fair on one
side of her face but ravaged by disease and deformity elsewhere.  The
farmer interrupts himself: please forgive me for painting in so much
detail the traits of the woman who, in the long run, is going to be my
daughter, because I love her dearly and think she’s fine.”  Sancho
picks up on that word painting, and so does Cervantes.  Sancho
banishes the farmer calling him ""the demon's own painter"" and the next
Sancho chapter begins ""We left the great governor angry and annoyed at
the sly painter of a farmer....""  

The picking up the word ""painter"" is an example of Sancho's love of
language, and language, for Sancho, is a sign of engaging with the
world.  Don Q loves silence -- it's mentioned once that what he
specifically liked about Don Diego's table was the silence that
reigned, and he repeatedly asks Sancho to hush.  I think this
infatuation with ""painter"" has something in deep in common with the
crazy anecdotes about the dogs, in the preface to part II; like
Sancho, the man who walks around saying ""that's a hound"" has been
brought to clear vision through a word.

The Acorns -- surf_wax mentioneth that Duke and Duchess seem a bit
agressive, manipulative, mocking -- but the Duchess seems to have genuine
affection for Sancho &amp; sends Tereza a gold and coral necklace, asking
for some big acorns in return.  This could be mocking her bumpkinness,
but it nevertheless gives Tereza genuine pleasure to comply.


 **Cross Dressing** The brother and sister who are confined to home
and leave dressed in each other's clothes recall the barber dressing
as a damsel in distress, and Luscinda as a Shepherd boy (both c. I.26).

bookclub,"What were your responses to this section? Be sure to check out the threads about Blake's poetry as it relates to the novel.

At the beginning of Ch 6 there is an interesting personal exchange between the senator and his counsel that has political implications as well. The counsel asks the senator to go easy on himself:

""Don't *blame* yourself!""

""I have spent my life demanding that people blame themselves for their misfortunes.""

Elliot's horrific mistake during WWII seems to be the event that explains a lot of his later behavior. How are we to understand this tragedy?

""Heaven is the bore of bores..."" [p110] I was reminded of the Talking Head's lyric, ""heaven is a place where nothing ever happens."""
bookclub,"**Spoilers thru ch. 7**

* In chapter 5, it is stated that Eliot has painted a William Blake poem going up the staircase to his office.  The poem is:

    &gt;The Angel

    &gt;that presided o'er my 

    &gt;birth said, 

    &gt;""little creature, 

    &gt;form'd of 

    &gt;Joy &amp; Mirth, 

    &gt;Go love 

    &gt;without the 

    &gt;help of 

    &gt;any Thing

    &gt;on Earth.""

* Later in chapter 7, Eliot talks about baptizing Mary Moody's twins.  He imagines the situation and says, 
&gt; ""Hello, babies.  Welcome to Earth.  It's hot in the summer and cold in the winter.  It's round and wet and crowded.  At the outside, babies you've got about a hundred years here.  There's only one rule that I know of, babies--: ' God damn it, you've got to be kind.'""


    * It seems like Eliot is mirroring the Angel from Blake's poem who presided over a birth and told the baby to love selflessly.  

* The Senator responded to Eliot's staircase poem by writing another Blake poem in pencil on the wall:

    &gt;Love seeketh only Self to please,

    &gt;To bind another in Its delight,

    &gt;Joys in another's loss of ease,

    &gt;And build a Hell in Heaven's despite.

    * I found this poem interesting.  Obviously, the first line says that love is self-serving.  But then, does ""bind"" mean to constrict another person or to sort of ""rope them in"" to this self-serving form of love in this? Also, the punctuation in the 3rd line changed my original interpretation; The joy one gets from another person leads to uneasiness (I originally thought it set up the concept of joy stemming from someone else's unease).  Perhaps this is saying that when love is dependent on another person (as it is, I would say, most of the time), there is much that can go wrong.  Anyway, if anyone interpreted lines of this differently or had thoughts, I'd love to hear them.   

    * *It is also interesting to note that the ""poem"" is actually a stanza that comes from a larger poem called ""The Clod and the Pebble"".**

    &gt;*The Clod and the Pebble*

    &gt;""Love seeketh not itself to please, 

    &gt;Nor for itself hath any care, 

    &gt;But for another gives its ease, 

    &gt;And builds a Heaven in Hell's despair.""     
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

    &gt;So sung a little Clod of Clay, 

    &gt;Trodden with the cattle's feet, 

    &gt;But a Pebble of the brook 

    &gt;Warbled out these metres meet:   
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  

    &gt;""Love seeketh only Self to please, 

    &gt;To bind another to its delight, 

    &gt;Joys in another's loss of ease, 

    &gt;And builds a Hell in Heaven's despite.""   
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

    &gt;William Blake

* It's funny that the Senator chose this excerpt from this larger poem because the first stanza seems to mirror Eliot's view of love.  It is also fitting that the clod of clay is downtrodden (or ""walked all over"") and the hardened pebble is on a brook which kind of nods to the money river (ch. 7).  This might not have been intentional at all but it's a neat parallel.


If anyone has thoughts or other poems they found in the book please share!"
bookclub,"This happens at the beginning of Chapter 5:

&gt; The signs were still there, but Eliot had painted out the messages. He had written a new one, a poem by William Blake. This was it, as broken up so as to fit twelve risers:
&gt;
&gt; The Angel
&gt; 
&gt; that presided
&gt; 
&gt; o'er my
&gt; 
&gt; birth said,
&gt; 
&gt; ""Little creature,
&gt; 
&gt; form'd of 
&gt; 
&gt; Joy &amp; Mirth,
&gt; 
&gt; Go love
&gt; 
&gt; without the
&gt; 
&gt; help of
&gt; 
&gt; any Thing
&gt; 
&gt; on Earth.""
&gt;
&gt; At the foot of the stairs, written in pencil on the wall, by the Senator himself, was the Senator's rebuttal, another poem by Blake:
&gt;
&gt; Love seeketh only Self to please,
&gt;
&gt; To bind another to Its delight,
&gt;
&gt; Joys in another's loss of ease,
&gt;
&gt; And builds a Hell in Heaven's despite.

I looked up the poems. The first one is just a couple of lines from a notebook, and the meaning seems to be that love is selfless and organic. The second one is from *Songs of Innocence* and starts out with an optimistic view of love, but then after the speaker is ill-treated, winds up reversing the pattern to call love selfish and ruinous.

It's an interesting and effective way to compare and contrast both Eliot and the Senator. They both choose Blake, but find contrasting poems to quote, like how one might have the same physical characteristics or mannerisms of one's parents but be otherwise very different.

An aside, there is a chapter break at this point. I'd just examined the poems and had come to the above conclusion, and I was expecting the subject to change completely, but then Vonnegut hits us with this and I had to laugh:

&gt; Back in Washington, Eliot's father was wishing out loud that he and Eliot were both dead."

bookclub,"Tony, speaking to Lyra in the boat after her rescue:

""You ever heard of the Nälkäinens? ... That's a kind of ghost they got up there in those forests. Same size as a child, and they got no heads.""

That's the severed children. Remember later, when Lyra finds Tony Makarios and the guy whose shed he was in is afraid of him? It's not that they don't have heads, it's that they don't have dæmons.

""And the Windsuckers, they're dangerous too. They drift about in the air. You come across clumps of 'em floated together sometimes, or caught snagged on a bramble. As soon as they touch you, all the strength goes out of you. You can't see 'em except as a kind of shimmer in the air.""

Specters, from *The Subtle Knife*, maybe?

""And the Breathless Ones.... Warriors half-killed. ... The North Tartars snap open their ribs and pull out their lungs. ... And their dæmons got to pump and pump all day and night, or else perish with 'em.""

This is the only one that didn't make sense to me. I'll keep an eye out for it as I read, but does that ring a bell for anyone else?"
bookclub,"Ohh, *The Golden Compass*. I love this book so much. I first read it when I was Lyra’s age and I didn’t understand much. I had a better grasp on it when *The Amber Spyglass* came out when I was 16, sneaked into a university lecture on it when I was 19, and have read it once or twice since then. I went to see the movie in 2007. I’ve written fanfic, had a pretend dæmon (first a hare like Hester, then a pine marten, then a wolverine… I still want a real one, NGL), copied pages to study Pullman’s writing style. I named a hamster after Roger’s dæmon Salcilia, and if I ever move out of California and get a ferret, I’ll probably name it Pantalaimon. I learned so much from this book: if Tartars, Skraelings, Tokay, Svalbard or the Republic of Texas come up, I remember this book because that’s where I learned about them — I was delighted to discover later that they were *real*. This book is like visiting a beloved aunt who still makes the same hot chocolate from a packet… you get older, but the enjoyment never fades.

Some stuff that stuck out to me this time was:

* The dæmons don’t always share their people’s feelings, but if someone is of two minds about something, the less dominant emotion is expressed in the dæmon. For example, Pantalaimon loses his shit regularly: when the head is shown in the Retiring Room, when Lyra switches the coins in the skulls. We see Mrs. Coulter restrain the golden monkey when Lyra brings up Dust. Pantalaimon says to Lyra, “I thought he was going to leap at you.” The golden monkey is often the part of Mrs. Coulter that does the dirty work, while she gets to keep her charming facade. I think I remember a part in *The Amber Spyglass* where he pulls the wings off bats or something.

* Dæmons also seem to be the nagging little voices that people experience; Pantalaimon is astute, and he has no qualms about speaking his mind, in much the same way we say things like, “A part of me always knew….” They’re conscience as well — they seem to embody everything contradictory in a person (they’re even usually the opposite sex of their person). When Lyra wants to save Lord Asriel, Pantalaimon wants to run away; when Lyra likes Mrs. Coulter, Pantalaimon is the one who comes up with good reasons not to.

* What do you make of Mrs. Coulter’s “metallic” smell? As far as I remember, it doesn’t come up again outside the first part of this book."
bookclub,"This is a mix of differences between the real world and Lyra's that I thought wouldn't be immediately obvious (so stuff like chocolatl isn't on the list), and of cultural references.

* **Skraeling** - Aboriginal Greenlander/possibly all aboriginal northerners?

* **New Denmark** - Greenland

* **John Calvin** - In real life, John Calvin, the father of Calvinism, was a French theologian and Protestant reformer who broke with the church in the early 16th century. In Lyra’s world, he became pope, and it seems as though the Protestant Reformation never happened, or died with Martin Luther. I don’t know enough about history to know if that could have ended the Reformation. It looks like Henry VIII never got a chance to establish the Anglican Church, either.

* **Philosophy** - Used here in place of “science”

* **Gyptians** - The Romani people. Ethnically Indian but long ago, people thought they were from Egypt, hence “gypsies” or “gyptians”

bookclub,"I just finished ""The Garden of Forking Paths"" and I want to get your thoughts on it.

The central idea is that there's a book that makes no sense if read straight through, but it's instead meant to be read as a series of possibilities -- in one chapter, Thing A happens, but in the next chapter, it's Thing B, and the paths continue to fork from there. Borges basically invented the Choose Your Own Adventure... or for something more modern, it's a bit like *Life After Life*, where the story doesn't *only* start over with Ursula's death.

What got me was the twist, though. There are three layers to this story: the central idea, Yu Tsun's story, and the archive note that puts the story into context. A lot of/most of(?) Borges's stories don't have an actual plot to them, and yet this one does, and manages to introduce an extra twist once you think you've got the point of it.

Why do you think he did that? Was it to cause an actual bifurcation in the storyline? We expect that Albert is a German agent somehow (although that bit about getting his name from the phone book is a bit odd), but it turns out that that is the a different, unshown chapter. Instead he hits us with something unexpected, and our original assumption sits there, ghost-like, at the very moment we're thinking about timelines and bifurcations and ""what ifs"".

Anyone have a different interpretation? Sometimes Borges himself is a puzzle."
bookclub,"I liked the duke and the duchess at first, but now they remind me of Charlie’s “friends” in *Flowers for Algernon*, when he hasn’t yet figured out that they’re making fun of him. They’re not even just having a laugh, they’re causing poor DQ and Sancho all kinds of distress and pain.

I wonder if this is the reader response that Cervantes intended? And why do you think they do it? Sancho earlier confessed to the duchess that he could make DQ believe basically whatever he wanted, and the duchess not only ran with it, she turned it around on Sancho to see if he was as gullible as DQ was. And he is! What horrible, mean little people.

This bit is interesting: after Sancho lies about what he’s seen on the back of the wooden horse (which I thought was going to turn out to be a boat, annoying), DQ takes him aside and says, “Just as you want people to believe what you have seen in the sky, I want you to believe what I saw in the Cave of Montesinos. And that is all I have to say.”

What do you think of this? He called bullshit on Sancho’s story a page before, so it sounds like he’s not being taken in by it; on the contrary, he sees Sancho’s further lies as analogous to his own lies about the cave. Or maybe just the reception of them is the same? I’m not sure DQ would draw that parallel so plainly/aloud if he didn’t want Sancho to conclude that DQ’s story was a fabrication.

What did you take away from this section?"
bookclub,"

What’s a dream and what’s real? Was the dream of his wife her actual ghost, or not? Is the wolf girl Grainier’s daughter?

Grainier’s name at first reminded me of Mount Rainier in Washington, but as I read, I wondered if it had a more symbolic purpose: as we make our way through the story, the past gets grainier and grainier, and even at the end, Grainier is still something of a relic, having never spoken on the phone or seen the Pacific Ocean even in 1960. He never has children other than Kate, and so there’s no one to bring him into the future. He’s rattled by his encounter with an airplane. The world seems to have moved on and left Grainier in his cabin, aging and fading.

What do you think of the way that Johnson wrote his origins? He seems to have come out of an unknowable fog, and the people who might be able to tell him about himself die before he’s old enough to ask. He also fades back into it; no one is with him when he dies, and he exists unburied for months before someone finds him.

We've had some good posts on this book, notably by [Earthsophagus](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/6w5fvb/train_dreams_a_tidy_pivot_at_beginning_of_chapter/) and [Hongkie](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/6vmjsj/train_dreams_the_sublime_ts_eliot_wordsworth/). Check them out if you haven't had a chance yet."
bookclub,"The beginning of page 57, there's a structuring sentence I didn't notice in the rush of the  first read -- ""At just about the time Grainier discovered a rhythm to his seasons—summers in Washington, spring and fall at his cabin, winters boarding in Bonners Ferry—he began to see he couldn’t make it last.""

As an example of craft, it effectively breaks the stasis that was settling in chapter 4 (continuity of Gladys, fading memory of Kate, cycle of life in Red-dog and pup).  Plot drivers were dying down, the fire banked -- 

What springs up is physical deterioration and economic necessity.   From his employer's boy's sudden death, he takes up being a carter, &amp; this enables episodic progression; the story can naturally generate incident without any prominent conflict or goal.

The economic struggle that breaks men and takes them away from their family reminds me of *The Jungle*.  To me, this aspect feels to be at war with the sublime [/u/hongkie wrote about](https://redd.it/6vmjsj).  Rather than being overcome by ineffable eternal grandeur evidencing a higher something to which he stands in mysterious relation, man is overcome by niggling concrete obvious blows in the quotidien routine he submits to.  You're humbled either way, but being humbled by the sublime at least suggests you're in a sensible cosmos, hostile or not.  In economic persecution, you're busted up in a world where you're just a cog that will inevitably wear down, be replaced, striving for a carrot you can't reach."
bookclub,"Building off a [recent Rosewater discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/6vamiw/scheduled_rosewater_thru_ch_4/dlyy4pl/) re: showing and telling with /u/thechikinguy:

I'm reading *The Golden Compass* for the first time in eight years or so, and lots of different things are striking me, but in particular I'm interested in how Pullman sneaks little bits of information in. By page 15 (or when Lord Asriel breaks the decanter of Tokay and makes it look like the Porter did it, depending on your copy) we know several things about Lyra due to clever little asides:

* ""She had lived most of her life in the College, but had never seen the Retiring Room before ...""
* Insatiable curiosity (going into the Retiring Room in the first place; wondering aloud to Pantalaimon what the Scholars talk about; ""They have a ritual or something. And I just wanted to know what it was."")
* Tough (""...if he caught her in here she'd be severely punished, but she could put up with that."" Also, ""It might have been enough to make her cry, if she was the sort of girl who cried."")
* Brave (""But now I've seen what the Master did, I haven't got any choice. You're supposed to know about conscience, aren't you?"")
* ...but not stupid (""Lyra was afraid of the Steward, who had twice beaten her."")

We also learn a lot about Asriel. There's a bit of tell in there where we find out some background on Lord Asriel (the bit that goes, ""...Lord Asriel, was her uncle, a man whom she admired and feared greatly,"" and then goes on for a while), but I didn't get the full measure of his character until Lyra explodes from the wardrobe and he twists her arm, and then tells her bluntly:

* ""I'll break your arm first. How dare you come in here?""
* ""If I hear the slightest noise, I'll make you wish you were dead."" *Daaaaaamn.*
* ""Make a noise in there and I won't help you. You're on your own.""

These are arguably more valuable details than the throwaway (but still important) tells prior, that he was ""involved in high politics"" and ""was fierce"".

Pullman seems to find a good mix of show and tell. This isn't an easy book for its marketed audience -- I didn't understand it when I was Lyra's age -- and he has to get a lot of information in there about politics and science and Lyra's world while still keeping most of the story from a child's point of view. (The end of Chapter 1, with the Master and the Librarian, on the other hand, has always felt shoehorned in for exposition; I don't think we come back to them outside Lyra's POV again, ever.)"

**Different modes of story telling in Part II**

This section includes a puppet show, which itself entails an interpretter translator.  A previous chapter involved a vision/dream in the cave.  Although they aren't quite story-telling, the divining monkey and the allegorical pageant are related communication.  In previous sections, the stories were all related directly by people, usually first- or second-hand experience.  (Though Quixote's first-hand experience involved more giants than most people perceived.)


**The braying story**

This reminded me of the tone of Hundred Years of Solitude, involving psychologically realistic interactions in an almost flippant goofiness of story -- the mixture of realism -- it's all stuff that *could* happen with narrative incongruity -- involved, absurd -- is my first attempt at explaining what gives it that flavor.

**Room at the inn**

""Senor Innkeeper, is there room at the inn?  For the soothsayingg monkey is coming here, and a puppet show about the freeing of Melisendra.""

To me, ""room at the inn"" immediately recalls the Mary and Joseph looking for a place and Jesus born in a manger.  Mentioning a ""soothsaying monkey"" in the immediate proximity seems edgily profane/parodic to me.  Anyone else?

**Narrative looseness**

So we find the puppet master is one of the convicts Quixote freed in part I, so what?  The ""plot"" is still arbitrary, episodic, ungoverned, formless.

bookclub,"This is about the fencing contest in ch 19, just before the
Sancho and Quixote get to the wedding:

My thesis: To Don Q., proficiency in fencing bespeaks nobility of
character, and the episode indicates agreement with the high value on
such courtly achievements.  I think this is evidence for sympathy on
Cervantes's part for the chivalrous ethic and outlook Quixote
champions.

Vocabulary: licentiate - here: one who holds a degree between 
bachelor and doctor; also: one who holds an official license

---

Giving rise to the scene, someone mentions that Basilio is an expert
fencer; and Don Quixote says something to the effect of  ""for that
one achievement he deserves not just the love of Senorita Quiteria,
but Guinevere.""  This aside slips in Quixote's high regard for
fencing, and his associations with the glamorous pinnacle of
gallant chivalry.

Corchuelo, the athletic, cynical bachelor, mocks the licentiate (whose
name we never get) for studying fencing; the licentiate responds
coolly that Corchuelo is wrong; Corchuelo challenges shortly finds
himself  with his shirt in tatters, and a wound on his mouth.

Corchuelo's response is both gracious and entirely submissive:

&gt; “I’m happy,” responded Corchuelo, “that I fell off my high horse,
and that experience has shown me a truth I refused to acknowledge.”

While they continue on their way to the wedding, the licentiate
talks swordsmanship, all are enlightened ""Corchuelo's obstinancy was
overcome,"" and we never hear of them again, I don't believe.

The striking decency, calm and restraint of the licentiate are
prominent in this scene, and the vicotry results not in a gloating
defeat but in stasis where *everyone feels the outcome is right*.

I take this as evidence that the values of the world Don Q pines for
are prized by Cervantes, too.  The novel's argument, I think, is that
it is  for the best when those who scoff at study and tradition
are put in their place.
"
bookclub,"Ok, here we are.

What did you think of the disclaimer that all persons...should not be construed?

What did you make of the initial disclosure that a ""sum of money"" is a leading character in this book?

Although I have never read Rosewater before I was surprised to find what I consider to be well known quotes of Vonnegut so early in the book. For example, ""Thus did a handful of rapacious citizens come to control all that was worth controlling in America."" [P8]

What did you think about the references to Hamlet?

Please don't rely on my prompts - feel free to discuss what is interesting to you. I found that I was struck by how topical Vonnegut's writing is today. We're still worried about the issues that he was worried about in his own lifetime. Just to mention one example he writes about the fear of technology replacing human labor. "
bookclub,"#Summary of this part &amp;:  The End is Nigh

A summary if ink were scarce: Sancho and DQ are fed and rested at the
home of Don Diego and his son the poet; they leave for a fabled cave,
but on the way go to a wedding where the grooms get changed at the
last minute; Don Q. goes into the cave; they meet a man who promises
an interesting story

There's so much in these chapters I'm going to post separately about
the cave and the various poems, below are a couple observations.  I'll
also be doing a scheduled post August 24, and then surf_wax will on
saturday the 26th; then we'll each do one more &amp; that will end the
scheduled discussions.  


# The truth and relevance

There is a lot of *ostensibly impish* discussion with serious
underpinnings in this section about **truth and significance** in
narrative.

The details - Quixote arrives at Don Diego's house, we're told the original author
gives many details of the house and its furnishings, but that the
translator opts to ""pass over these and other similar minutiae in
silence, because they did not accord with the principal purpose of the
history, whose strength lies more in its truth than in cold
digressions.""  A few lines later, it mentions DQ washed his face ""with
five pots, or perhaps six pots of water, there being some difference
of opinion regarding the number,"" so significance and criteria for
inclusion are evidently in the eye of the beholder.  The notably wordy
phrasing, not ""five or six pots,"" emphasizes the irrelevance of the
inclusion.


# The Allegorical Wedding Pageant; Social Mobility and Fixed Virtues

A key line: a traveller they encounter tells the duo about an upcoming
wedding: ""she is eighteen and he is twenty-two; they are equals,
though certain inquisitive people who have the lineages of the entire
world memorized claim that fair Quiteria’s is superior to Camacho’s,
but nobody thinks about that nowadays"" (ch 19).  ""Nobody thinks
about that nowadays"" -- i.e. lineage and the claims of nobility
are antique, like Don Q's ideals.

The wedding pageant -- Chapter XX -- is so much about material things:
having, saving, giving, squandering.  While love has a place in the
worldview, the character Interest starts off with ""I am mightier than
love."" Sancho basically agrees: ""You are worth what you have.""  

The setting is fabulously dense with foodstuffs - steer stuffed
with six suckling pigs, trees festooned with an infinity of skinned
fowl and rabbit waiting to dropp into enormous cooking vats.

Initially (ch 19) Sancho says that people in love should marry,
and it  was wrong of Senora Quiteria's father to give her to a rich
man; but by ch 20, seeing Camucho's wealth (and enjoying the feast),
Sancho comes around to saying it would be foolsih not to marry the
rich.  Don Q. flips his position too;  in ch 19 he seems to argue
children owe their parents obediance; but when he learns of Basilio's
martial or anyway macho virtues, he thinks Basilio deserves the
maidens hand.

bookclub,"The first place Grainier works in the woods in Robinson Gorge.  As far as I can tell, there's no such place in Washington, or  Canada/Idaho.  (There  is one in Queensland Australia).  Later in the book he mentions the Selkirk  Mountains -- Selkirk is the castaway Defoe's *Robinson Crusoe* was inspired  by."
bookclub,"Judging from the upvotes and comments I got on my *Golden Compass* post, there are a handful of us interested in reading the *His Dark Materials* trilogy before *The Book of Dust: La Belle Sauvage* comes out on October 19th. /u/Earthsophagus said it's okay to do them all. We're doing this under the [Evergreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/wiki/evergreen) rule -- please have a look at that link!

This is a pretty quick schedule, because I'd like to be close to done by the time *The Book of Dust* comes out on October 19th. Please don't feel compelled to stick to it! /r/bookclub has a lot of fun stuff coming up, I'm reading some hard stuff elsewhere, some of us are going to be into midterms at school or working on end of fiscal year stuff at work, I have a business trip the first week of October. This is just pace-setting!

So:

* The Golden Compass from Chapter 1 through Chapter 7 - 8/27
* The Golden Compass from Chapter 8 through Chapter 15 - 9/3
* The Golden Compass from Chapter 16 through Chapter 23 - 9/10

* The Subtle Knife from Chapter 1 through Chapter 5 - 9/17
* The Subtle Knife from Chapter 6 through Chapter 10 - 9/24
* The Subtle Knife from Chapter 11 through Chapter 15 - 10/1

* The Amber Spyglass from Chapter 1 through Chapter 10 - 10/8
* The Amber Spyglass from Chapter 11 through Chapter 18 - 10/15
* The Amber Spyglass from Chapter 19 through Chapter 28 - 10/22
* The Amber Spyglass from Chapter 29 through Chapter 38 - 10/29

* Lyra's Oxford (short story) - 11/5
* Once Upon a Time in the North (novella) - 11/12
* The Collectors ([ebook](https://www.amazon.com/Collectors-Materials-Story-Kindle-Single-ebook/dp/B0138OGO72) | [audiobook](https://www.audible.com/pd/Fiction/The-Collectors-Audiobook/B00QU77W1W/)) - 11/19

What do you think we should do about *The Book of Dust*? It's going to be in high demand at libraries and not everyone can justify their own copy -- maybe we can revive the discussion around January or February to talk about it?"
bookclub,"In another thread about Borges, quoth surf_wax:

&gt; ""Oh, you could make whatever you want out of pixels.""  But it turns out that it's easier to go to Africa with a camera and spend three weeks camping in the bush for that perfect shot of a cheetah taking down a gazelle than to sit there at your computer with Paint open, choosing the right color for each pixel. In the end you have the same thing, but only one thing is actually *possible.*

That reminded me of Menard thinking of how he could go about composing Quixote; quoth Borges:

&gt; Initially, Menard’s method was to be relatively simple: Learn Spanish, return to Catholicism, fight against the Moor or Turk, forget the history of Europe between the years 1602 and 1918--*be* Miguel de Cervantes. Pierre Menard weighed that course (I know he pretty thoroughly mastered seventeenth century Castilian) . . . .""

The deadpan delivery of the preposterous scheme is what I like -- a few words  later it turns out he's being accurate: it's *relatively* simple scheme, among the many impossible approaches.  Anyway, surf_wax's practically  impossible possibility reminded me of that."
bookclub,"Four -- plus or minus 2 or 3... what are the last few books/stories/essays
or other unit-of-composition you read?

What's a scene you remember, or a vocabulary word, or a character's mannerism --
something that's in your brain now that wouldn't be had you not read
the piece -- try to say *something* about the piece other than a title.


Free form: you can include in progress or completed, abandoned or re-read, skimmed or studied, as the spirit moves you. 

For moi:

 *Autumn*, Ali Smith - I remember the narrator being surprised by her
mother's depth of insight and unsuspected experiences; the mother at first
seemed materialistic and shallow and irritating, and that relationship
giving signs of blossoming -- against the generally winding-down feel of
the book.

 *Death in Venice* the bossy gondolier -- was he supposed to recall
the guy who ferries you across the Styx (Charon?)

 *Game Warden/The Last Wolf* A couple short stories by László
Krasznahorkai -- I remember the taxidemied wolf under glass absurdly
huge in the house.  Also I read this right before I started Don
Quixote and the place name ""Extremadura,"" which I suspected was a
fabrication and looked up, would have stuck with me anyway, then it
comes up a few times in DQ.

 *Revolutionary Road* The roadhouse bar where April in boredom gives
herself to -- I don't remember the guy's name, ""Ernie"" seems apt -- his
excitement, her faux passivity.  It just now  occurs to me . . . was
he the father of her last pregnancy?

 *A Whistling Woman* This was final book of a 4-book series, about
an intellectual coming of age in 1960s London.  The 4 books are each
structured very differently from each other, and this was a fairly
straightforward falling-in-love-with-someone-you-hated-and-growing-
apart-from-a-lover-and-reconciling-with-your-parents-and-learning-
your-limits-and-living-with-a-bitter-divorce-from-an-evil-person story.  Byatt is never a flashy writer but the scenes
in this one are psychologically solid: I remember a couple in a
cold cottage tentatively  becoming lovers, in the same bed where
a disastrous previous lovership began.
"
bookclub,"The fallacy in Library of Babel is that writing is a matter of arranging letters -- a million monkeys typing would sooner or later write Hamlet.   If literature were merely a sequence of letters, just the mental operation of understanding that hypothetically all books could be generated would allow us to talk about imaginary books as if they were real . . . hmmm.

But the idea of a world where all great books exist, you just have to find them on the stacks -- where somewhere there is a book that eloquently explains the purpose of your life and proves you lived it worthily - and where books are all there is, except a bed and a toilet - books forever.  That reminds me of a line in Rosewater: ""what Trout had in common with with pornography wasn't sex but fantasies of an impossibly hospitable world.""

The librarians life in a world where everything is geared to allow them to give their lives to reading winnowing  texts. The narrator is content to think that text is the universe.  For a bookish person, this is a kind of paradise."
bookclub,"I got inspired by the vocabulary posts and also by looking up a bunch of stuff during my read-through tonight of Chapters 1-4, so I'm starting this post on cultural references that Vonnegut includes. Feel free to add your own if I missed something you think belongs in here -- what I think is notable probably doesn't overlap exactly with what you do.

* **Rothschild, DuPont** - Sylvia's maternal grandparents belonged to these families, who in real life (and also in the book) are super-rich European families. The Du Ponts mostly live in the US now, according to the skim I did of Wikipedia. One of them founded the DuPont Company, which makes chemicals, notably Teflon and Tyvek.

* **Kilgore Trout** - A writer character created by Vonnegut who gets a mention in most of his novels, including *Slaughterhouse-Five*. I seem to remember him from mentions elsewhere, but nothing on the Wikipedia page rings a bell, so either it's incomplete or my memory is bad. Wikipedia adds that Trout often has an entirely different personality from novel to novel, I wonder if Vonnegut just didn't care or if he was doing something deeper.

* **2BRO2B** - A science fiction short story by Vonnegut, mentioned in *Rosewater* as though it's fictional. I haven't read it yet, but it's available on [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/21279/21279-h/21279-h.htm).

* **Planet Tralfamadore** - An alien planet that, like Trout, exists in multiple Vonnegut novels. This is the planet that Billy Pilgrim gets abducted to in *Slaughterhouse-Five*.

* **Roy Cohn** - Joe McCarthy's right hand. I looked him up because I remembered his name from ""We Didn't Start the Fire"" by Billy Joel. He also prosecuted the Rosenbergs and worked for Donald Trump, John Gotti and Richard Nixon.

* **""taut Viennese opinion""** - This is how Eliot's psychoanalyst's assessment is described, and I think it means he's a Freudian.

* **Samuel Gompers** - American Federation of Labor founder (one of the first unions, merged into the AFL-CIO years later). Championed workers' rights.

* **Thorstein Veblen** - An American anti-capitalist economist who coined the phrase ""conspicuous consumption"" -- not his biggest contribution to economics but the one I thought most people would recognize.

* **Elsinore, California** - ...does not exist! We do have a Lake Elsinore, which is out in the Riverside County boondocks, southeast of Los Angeles.

* **Mondrian** - The guy who did the paintings made up of rectangles... I can't describe it, look him up on Google Images and you'll recognize it instantly.

* **Henry J** - An old-style 50s sedan.

* **Ilse Koch** - An extra-sadistic Nazi who did a lot of horrific things at Buchenwald and Majdanek (another death camp), most notably had tattooed prisoners murdered so a Nazi ""doctor"" could ""study"" their tattooed body parts. She killed herself in prison a couple years after *Rosewater* was published.

* **Purple Heart with Cluster** - An oak leaf cluster on a Purple Heart indicates the award of an additional Purple Heart, so Eliot was wounded twice."
bookclub,"It's a great passage (ch 2, page 20) about the monstrous equipment, the semi-useless old man, and the kid swabbing cables  with dogfish oil -- the kid stumbles and is ""saved from a mutilated death"" by Grainier.  Later in the chapter it's mentioned in passing that Harold the elder lost all his family and that makes Grainier (whose adoptive father was also named Robert) admire him.  In between, old-man Billy is calling out ""his own name"" -- it doesn't occur to anyone it might be a lost son.  Anyway, a world where death is everywhere, one life is saved."
bookclub,"There's a story one of the characters in Train Dreams tells, of a rich drunk who bet a fortune he could outrun a stallion.  He lost.  The story ends ""of course he's busted down to his drop-bottoms now, and couldn't make a decent wager.""

I thought maybe it meant underwear or something -- those longjohns that unbutton in back that you see in cartoons -- but looking in dictionaries and google books, I couldn't find any support for that.  As far as I can tell, Johnson just made up the expression.

Interesting though, one dictionary, Merriam-Webster, has ""a railroad freight car with a drop bottom."""
bookclub,"With *The Book of Dust, Vol. 1* coming out on October 19th, I'm planning to reread *The Golden Compass* to brush up on details I may have forgotten. I'd love to discuss the whole canon, which right now consists of:

* The Golden Compass/Northern Lights
* The Subtle Knife
* The Amber Spyglass
* Once Upon a Time in the North
* Lyra's Oxford
* The Collectors ([available on Audible for a few bucks](https://www.audible.com/pd/Fiction/The-Collectors-Audiobook/B00QU77W1W))

Anyone want to read them with me? (Hopefully it's okay to include the whole series, plus *The Book of Dust*? Mods?) I'm envisioning something pretty low-key, no real schedule but kind of start from *Golden Compass* and post as you go, observations on the books, maybe a silly post where we speculate about what our dæmons would be or others on how Lyra's world got to be the way it is or the meanings of the symbols used in the alethiometer.

bookclub,"I don't know about you guys, but this book knocked my socks off, and I'm super glad we're reading it. This is what I want my stories to be, as a writer -- interesting, poetic, full of symbolism when you think back on them. I didn't notice a whole lot of what was going on while I was reading the book, but after I finished it, I found a whole bunch of cool things... that will have to wait until next week because I don't want to spoil anyone.

In the meantime, we're discussing Chapters 1-4. The book opens with Grainier doing something pretty horrific, for reasons that not even he seems to know: he sees some white people trying to drag a struggling Chinese laborer to his death, and he steps in to help them.

It's never really explained why he does this, although in the first part of Chapter 3 he remembers a whole town of Chinese people moved by train and associates that with the memory of having wanted to kill the laborer. Why do you think he connects those two things? Is it just because everyone was Chinese, or is there something bigger and deeper going on?

And then there's the episode with Haley, who child-Grainier stumbles upon by the creek. Haley is dying of sepsis and tells Grainier this horrific story about impregnating his 12-year-old niece, which is probably going to stick in my memory forever, ugh. What is the purpose of this scene? What do you think it says about Grainier that he walks away and doesn't tell anyone about Haley?

What did you notice about the first half of the book? Anything specific you want to discuss?"

From **Train Dreams** --

corduroy road -- a road made of tree trunks laid side by side.  [Here's an article with a nice sketch](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/waterloo-corduroy-road-found-king-street-lrt-construction-1.3502375)

effulgent - (literary) - very bright, radiant

bear sign -- Johnson I think means bear dung; it can mean any sign of bear to a tracker (scratching, tracks) -- but it's also and most commonly a [cowboy term for doughnuts](http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/bear_sign_doughnuts)

pulchritude -- literary term for beauty


-------

From *Mr. Rosewater*

carriage house -- a building used to ""park"" a horse-drawn carriage, with tack for the horses, etc.  [wikipedia article with pictures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage_house).

Stew -- used in the speech Eliot's father made to congress -- he uses it to mean, I think, ""a state of agitated excitement or worry"", but it can also mean brothel, and I wasn't sure if it had some wider sense of immoral endeavor. "
bookclub,"In this section, we ""find"" the beautiful but clearly enchanted Dulcinea of Toboso, who does *not* play along with DQ and Sancho but runs the hell away after DQ *grabs her horse's reins*, which is not just rude AF but actually really threatening no matter how it's meant. DQ has all of Pepe LePew's delusions but luckily only a fraction of his persistence.

Something the story hasn't really shied away from is the realistic reactions of the people observing DQ's madness, from ""Dulcinea's"" fear to the exploitation of the Knight of the Wood (and a number of instances prior). /u/dynam0 observed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/6s9qtg/don_quixote_chapters_4045/dlu5ywq/) that (and I'm going to quote their whole comment because I think it's a good one):

&gt; What stood out to me in this section was the growing crowd of people who are, for lack of a better word, ""enabling"" DQ because they think it's funny. I'm interested to see where Cervantes takes it. It seems bad, though. But also a connection to us, the readers, if we're just reading along looking to see what crazy thing he does next as well?

I see similar things today: public freakout videos on YouTube where some of the people videoed have clear mental issues, the way senior citizens and the mentally disabled are targeted, the way we talk about people we disagree with or people who do horrific things by framing them as ""stupid"" or ""crazy"". Who here hasn't smiled and nodded at someone with an intellectual disability they don't want to take the time to understand? And who hasn't crossed the street or felt their stomach flip but also kind of stared when someone's raging out to themselves on a city street? Has anything really changed in the last 400 years?

We talked about DQ's madness much earlier in the book. Has your opinion changed since then? Is he believing what he wants to believe, or has he lost his marbles?

bookclub,"Here's a thread to post some early thoughts (no spoilers please). You can also post your origin story as a Vonnegut reader or any other anecdotes about the author that might be of interest.

I read quite a few of his novels in HS and remember loving them at the time. Didn't get around to reading Slaughterhouse until much later and enjoyed that as well. When his book of letters came out I was very amused by some of the pranks he pulled, particularly the one when he worked at GE.

When I browse used bookstores I'm always amazed at how well his novels hold their value. His paperbacks are often listed at $10 while most books are $2 or $3.

Oh, last thought - when I think of Vonnegut I often pair him with Salinger as the two famous authors who saw more action in WWII than any others. I might be wrong about this because many great authors came out of WWII and I may just have Vonnegut and Salinger placed in a special group due to my own affinity for them.

bookclub,"Hi! 

After seeing [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/6thwlk/three_no_four_new_initiatives_three_at_the_usual/) link explaining the new labels, I would like to start the campaign for an official read of *Good Omens* by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett. I will gladly be the read runner for this book. I'm not sure which month would be the best for this read, but I am totally flexible. 

What do you guys think?"
bookclub,"In the first few pages -- I've only read partway into Eliot's sealed letter -- the tone is flippant and cynical.  

The couple most striking statements so far are about Mushari - His enormous ass was luminous when bare and that he got the nickname the weasel (mentioned indirectly by talking about how he doesn't notice coworkers humming ""Pop goes the weasel"".)  The first is part of  the flippancy, it's incongruous, not observing convention, to highlight a character's ass &amp; weird to say it's luminous -- like a firefly?  

The second is just characterization by having others talk about a character-- it's more memorable  than direct narrator comment like the line that the Rosewater Corp. employees were cunning, happy and energetic.  (""Cunning"" flavors the description with cynicism, but doesn't stick the way that ""Weasel"" does)"
bookclub,"Minimalist recap of the story: Part II opens Don Quixote taking bed rest

the night in search of Dulcinea, mistress of the Don's heart.


In between is much talk.  Here are a few observations I had.  Take
these as a jumping off point -- I recommend starting new threads about
any other facet, or even for responsive comments to what I have here,

 **Textiness**

The book is drawing attention to itself as a book.  Surf_wax pointed
out the game of the characters speculating about the deficiencies the
author showed in Part I [here](https://redd.it/6tph8e).

The translator and original author also both start questioning the
veracity of the story (and this recurs thruoughout book II).  At the
same time there is repeated insistence on the ""absolute truth of the
story.""  The simple fact of preserving the work as a translation of a
Moor's account, and now and again mentioning that Moors are not to be
trusted calls attention to the work being composed.  So does the
recurring discussion of how narrative should be (whether to ""leave ink
in the inkwell"", Quixote and Pancho's disccusion about whether it's
necessary to have their beatings described).

----

Ch 8, a joke: The heading for Chapter 8 is *Which recounts what befell Don
Quixote as he was going to see his lady Dulcina of Toboso.*  From the
third through the 30th paragraghs, there is nothing but dialog between
Quixote &amp; Panza; the following paragraph is  the Chapter's final paragraph,
and it starts:  ""They spent that night and the following day in
this and other similar conversations, and nothing worth recounting
happened to them....""

Again, this is an ""inky"" joke -- it's introduced solely via chapter
heading, drawing attention to the stories construction and presentation.


-----

Ch 8: Statistical thinking:

Sancho: ""I've heard that there are more friars in heaven than knights
errant""

DQ: ""That is true,"" responded Don Quixote, ""because the number of religious
is greater than the number of knights""

-------

Also Ch 8: Who knew?: [Mausolus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mausolus), who was
the nominal Persian Satrap when I was a kid, in death gave birth to
the term ""mausoleum.""

----

The Preface: The beginning of part II is notable, besides calling
attention to the narrator, for some self-congratulatory remarks about
the popularity of Part I and digs at another author, who wrote a Part
II.  This leads somehow to two spectacularly pointless or oblique
shaggy dog stories or jokes; one surprisingly vulgar. If the two
punchlines make sense in any one culture, that culture varies from
mine in at least two regards.  [Here they
are](https://redd.it/6trdgz).

----

Ch. 1: Quixote's argument to prove that there really were knights smells
like Anselm's ""that which nothing greater can exist"" [argument
for the existence of god](https://www.princeton.edu/~grosen/puc/phi203/ontological.html).
He sets forth a series of unanswerable questions ""Who was more virtuous
and valiant than Amadis; more intelligent that Palmering...."" and lists
off about a dozen heroes, that is the sole structure of his element,
that the knights must have existed because they were exhibited the
pinnacle of some virtue.

bookclub,"We're doing a vote for our new book of the month over at /r/MurakamiBookClub, feel free to jump in and vote on it if you're interested in reading a certain Haruki Murakami book :)"
bookclub,"So we’ve got all these issues with Part 1. Edith Grossman kept on pointing out inconsistencies in her footnotes, particularly with regard to Sancho’s missing donkey, but also with Señora Panza’s name and other things, but she never said that *Cervantes was aware of this*. Did you notice how he cleaned up the narrative by ascribing the whole thing to a flawed writer? In fact, the bachelor, DQ and Sancho have a lengthy discussion about the story’s literary merit, the things the “author” got wrong and right, and Sancho clears up the matter of the donkey with a short anecdote about its theft.

So Cervantes does this curious thing that’s a mixture of immersing the reader by claiming that the story is true, and breaking down the fourth wall by having the characters acknowledge that they’re part of a narrative and actually comment on the story thus far. It’s an interesting way to reclaim control of the story after so many inconsistencies are pointed out. Anyone who’s written fiction knows that stories are never truly *done*, just abandoned, but Cervantes has found a way — albeit, a somewhat clumsy one — to pick up the story long after its publication and change how his audience might be viewing it."
bookclub,"&gt; “Oh, base, lowborn, wretched, rude, ignorant, foul-mouthed, ill-spoken, slanderous, insolent varlet! You have dared to speak such words in my presence and in the presence of these distinguished ladies, dared to fill your befuddled imagination with such vileness and effrontery? Leave my presence, unholy monster, repository of lies, stronghold of falsehoods, storehouse of deceits, inventor of iniquities, promulgator of insolence, enemy of the decorum owed to these royal persons. Go, do not appear before me under pain of my wrath!”
"
bookclub,"One of Sancho's endearing traits is the way he gets a dogged attachment to a verbal quirk -- when someone mentions something, he'll keep coming back to the language they used.  ""Insulas"" in part 1 was the notable example.  Early in part II, when they are talking about the hardships they underwent, DQ starts to use a latin proverb ""when the head aches, all the members ache"" -- and from this point forward we'll see Sancho refer to himself as a ""member"".  In modern (american high school?) English that would have some shade of meaning a penis, I don't know if that sense of ""member"" is present in 15th C Spanish.  At any rate, when Sancho uses the term, there's none of the sense of shared suffering or reciprocal participation that DQ intends by using the expression, it's just a word that is lodged in his mind.   


-- [Quixote is talking] . . . together we wandered ; one and the same fortune, one
and the same destiny has fallen upon us both ; if they
tossed thee in a blanket once, me they have thrashed a
hundred times; and this is where I have the advantage
of thee.

—And that is but right, responded Sancho, for
according to what your worship says, disasters are
rather the Knight’s perquisites than the squire’s.

—Thou art mistaken, Sancho, said Don Quixote,
according to that aphorism, *quando caput dolet* v 

—I understand no other tongue but my own, retorted  Sancho. '.

—-I mean, said Don Quixote, that when the head
aches all the other members suffer; and therefore, I
being thy master and lord, I am the head and thou a
part of me, since thou art my servant, and for this
reason the ill which touches me, or shall touch me,
should give pain to thee, and thine to me. "
bookclub,"UPDATE -- of these ideas, a couple weeks later, only **[Campaign]** still seems viable

I want to try a few new things. Volunteer to help for any of these
that you're interested in contributing your time + creativity to, or just jump in and start doing them.  Please suggest improvements &amp; other ideas, too.

The idea of each is to increase participation, by providing an
established ""formula"" that is easy, or is prompted, or that springs
from personal interest.  Three of the four initiatives are also
designed to increase discussion of books that have been previously
selected.

In brief

  **Excursions**: Posts reporting about stuff in other subs relevant to our selections  
  **Shower-thought like marginalia**: I'm still beating on the marginalia message  
  **Campaigning**: post about what you'd like to see bookclub select  
  **Fleurs du Maw**: passages you like from things we've read.    

Ultimately, I'd like to see bookclub be buzzing with surprising new
posts, a firehose to sip from.  Come for the scheduled posts, stay
for the wallop of strange, inky and wonderful things.  This last year has been great but I think
we can elicit more by cultivating varied approaches to posting -- in getting a regular
rhythm, I think we've established a tone of sameness.

As a smaller change - I'm going to ask surf_wax and platykurt to start, and
I'll try to remember, to tag scheduled discussions as [Scheduled].  I think
it might help orient newcomers to see those [tags].

#Excursions

Read a weeks' worth (could be any week -- this week last year, whatever) of another sub and write about any connections
you see in discussion there to works we've selected.  I'm thinking of
of these in particular: /r/wikipedia, /r/askhistorians, /r/literature.

Let me know if you're interested in doing any of these.  Especially
with Wikipedia and Ask Historians, it'd ask you to make a thorough
inventory of what you know.  From /r/literature, you might easily find
links taking applying critical ideas to some random book that you
could test against books you know from among what we'ver read.

I think these would be a little difficult to do, but might be interesting
and personally rewarding.

#Shower-thought like margingalia

This is the one I want to push: Restricted to books that have been
selected previously (or the current reads): post anything you think of
about them.  One thing I'd like to see come out of this is
conversations like ""that would be a good candidate for a re-read.""
These can be very brief posts, short enough to fit in a subject line.
I'm looking for what would be a catch tag name for these?  Marginalum?
Marginal Thought?

If you haven't been around bookclub long -- last winter we did a lot
of Marginalia posts, where you could just dump in random observations
about the current read.  [White Noise](https://redd.it/5g2vhd) and
[Madame Bovary](https://redd.it/5kedip) were perhaps most active.  That worked, and we might
go back to it, but the problem is that Reddit pushes everything that's
not a stickied thread to quick obsolescence.  The fundamental point
is: insightful reading is made up by compounding lots of little
insights, and there should be a culturatlly established way to post
short observations.

#Campaigns

A [Campaign] post means that you're trying to garner support to select
a book in a coming vote.  You can include excerpts, etc., and it's
fine to participate in full conversation about any book within the
[Campaign] thread.  This is related to the ""Accumulator"" idea, which
we can revive.  (see [Accumulator](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/65523g/the_candidate_accumulator_10/))

#Flowers of speech

 *Divers sont les parfums des fleurs* -- A Frequency Dictionary of French

Passages of fine writing, brief or long, places where you thought
the imagery or syntax was graceful, striking, or fun.  Tag it ""[Fleurs du maw]""
for now.

I'm going to start the selection/nominating thread thursday the 17th, with announcement  on the 24th.  I'm thinking 1 open, one novella, and one re-read.  I want to start accumulating a list of novellas, too, I think Bompalomp got a good beginning a few months ago.
"
bookclub,"This thread is to accumulate a list of novellas/short pieces/essays
that we can nominate from.  Not novels, not short stories, not plays,
but essays and long verse are okay (if you can't be just, be
arbitrary).  Let's say a novella is 47-171 pages, and we'll also take
weird poems, academic works, manifestos, religious tracts, travelogs
and stray essays of that length.  For novellas the preference would be
for dense contemporary stuff, or canonical things (not breezy
entertainments).

We'll post this occasionally, incorporating previous selections, and
give pointers to it when it's time for nominations.  Some of this is
lifted from Bompalomp's post.

"
bookclub,"Look at us! We've hit the HALFWAY POINT on this monster of a novel! Everyone still liking it? I'll be happy to have earned my DQ merit badge at the end of this, but I'm enjoying the process, too.

Here are some things I noticed:

* Cervantes has another sermon in chapters 47 and 48, this time about pulp drama vs. art. I guess the early 1600s had their Dan Browns, too. What do you think of his arguments? I always hear people say stuff like, ""At least they're reading."" Do you think citizens would have still gone to plays if they were artful plays as opposed to the early modern period's version of *Freddy Got Fingered*?

* Why do you think Cervantes self-inserts, like at the end of chapter 52 when he ends the story (kind of)? Is this a literary device intended to make the book seem like it actually could have happened? Does it have something to do with the novel being released in two parts?

* The ""enchantment"" works very well, and survives Sancho's ""gotcha"" to DQ about taking a dump. (An aside, that was a super precious exchange, Sancho trying very hard to be delicate and still get his meaning across.) DQ seems to cooperate better with people when they play by his rules; they can even let him out of his cage and he doesn't attack them or run away. Is he entirely guileless or do you think he has his own motivations here?

What else have you noticed?"
bookclub,"We're halfway -- if anyone has missed out on the beginning, I'm pretty sure you could jump in at part II and still appreciate it just as much -- there's no important plot set up in part I.  Part II, what I've read so far, first 10 chapters, is brisk reading.

"
bookclub,"There were two sections that I wanted to point out in Chapter 25 that show a deeper wrinkle in DQ's madness.  *As far as I know*, these are the only times he's shown an awareness that he's not seeing reality clearly. 

First is his explanation of ""Dulcinea"" Ch 25, p201 of the Grossman

&gt;And yes, not every poet who praises a lady, calling her by another name really has one...most are imagined in order to provide a subject for their verses, and so that people will think of them as lovers and as men who have the capacity to be lovers...And to conclude, I imagine everything I say is true, no more and no less, and I depict her in my imagination as I wish her to be in beauty and distinction. 


And later in the same chapter (203 in grossman) Sancho is talking about getting a response from ""Dulcinea"" and DQ replies:


&gt;""Well Sancho, it seems you are no saner than I.""



Hold up, what?!  Up to this point I don't remember seeing any ""cracks"" in DQ's madness.  Part of the humor was the crazy, twisting explanations he'd be forced to come up with to rationalize to Sancho and--it seemed--to himself for why he wasn't living in a Tale of Knight Errantry.  Do these quotes show that he knows the windmills aren't actually giants, but he just thinks that he pretends hard enough, people will start to go along with him? I guess up to this point I always thought he actually believed what he was saying. 



DQ compares himself to a poet--both creating beautiful lovers for the sake of the ""story"" they're trying to tell--what does this say about Cervantes' thoughts on writers? Are they just madmen hoping to convince everyone hard enough that their stories are real?


I also could be totally off the mark, but I'd love to hear other thoughts about this section, or DQ's madness in general!  The more discussion the better--I found this whole idea really interesting!"
bookclub,"Quote from Wikipedia

&gt; For Mario Vargas Llosa, ""If Emma Bovary had not read all those novels, it is possible that her fate might have been different.""

It is reading all those romances that gave Don Q. his particular madness.


Other books we've read / you've read with book-addled protagonists?  I'd say maybe Alice and Frank from Rev Road - the images they got of a bohemian life throbbing with Significance.

Or are any of those characters really ruined?  Wild destructive forces to themselfes and everyone around them sure, but is the problem them, or everyone around them?"
bookclub,"Hello! So the hidden meaning, value, teachings etc can be withdrawn from fiction. However, when I read something even as big as 1984 or Kite Runner, I feel like I don't imply these teachings into everyday life. How do you note the author's teachings and allow fiction to change your way of thinking?"

bookclub,"This pieces seeks to describe and asses the merit of a lost original
version of a novel; the novel and its author is Borges's invention.
The themes and images are about reflections, how goodness penetrates
mire, and light darkness -- that lost first edition is a source of
light in the story.  There are multiple fictional contexts, giving it
a funhouse effect.

Detective novels: this story asks you to actively engage your
intelligence to solve a problem; unlike a detective novel, it's not
clear what kind of question we're trying to solve.  Game-playing,
effortful working-out, piecing together isn't the characteristic
pleasure most of us take from reading. What is?  Flavor: things like
""the evil and lean pack of moon-coloured hounds.""  Borges can deftly
get vivid fictional effects in the confusing welter of intelleectual
games.

The unsurpassable pinnacle of snark achieved in 1936: ""one of those
islamic allegorical poets that seldom fail to interest their
translators"" in reference, I think, to The Parliament of the Birds.

Mirrors: we don't ever see goodness directly in Bahadur's novel.
Similarly, he can't see the original text directly, he can infer its
goodness from descriptions of how it varies from the front.

The best person, better even than a saint, is a helpful persian bookseller.

Why does this review come up with two criteria to judge the book and
find the version that he has wanting with respect to the second of them?

That the novel has parallels with one by Kipling is no coincidence,
says Bahadur, its author.  They are both reflecting the same reality
(although of course the Bahadur one is a fictitious book that
reflecting the same reality).  Back in 2017 context: An interesting
coincince (these notes on The City
Wall)[http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/rg_oncitywall1.htm] says that
the narrator of the story is not Kipling but someone that Kipling
would like to be -- making the historical Kipling posited by the
reviewer another possible reflection of an ideal.

bookclub,"Let's try to catch up the conversation on Borges -- everyone, feel free to start threads on any story/stories in first half of the book.  We'll of course have to do the Quixote one while the fire's hot.

--------

I suspect the impetus for the story is the funny way encyclopedias split with at odd looking fragments of words, so as a logical exercise, you can make up  a something that comes alphabetically between the two volumes.  Since the Encyclopedia is . . . *encyclopedic* there's a funny thing about postulating the existence of some vast other world that doesn't fit anywhere in the orthographically discontinuous universe that comes of making even-sized volumes.

The volume in question comes before Upps, which must be Uppsala.

----

Is it frivolous, to spin out details of differences of philosophical opinion in a world that doesn't exist, and where the sides of the argument have got no obvious correspondence to anything in this world?

A favorite line: . . . the rest seemed quite plausible, very  much in keeping with the general tone of the work, even (naturally) somewhat boring.

-------

There is something monstrous about mirrors -- in some way, this story is a reflection of how scholars give accounts, the evenness of tone, sweeping philosophic schemas presented cheek by jowl with fine and quirky detail (how older Uruguayans pronounce gaucho alongside we confirmed documentation of hitherto unknown world).
"
bookclub,"A year ago, bookclub started going to a more strongly scheduled format, with a ""read runner"" named  for each book, who made scheduled posts.  That's been mostly good, I think; many selected books didn't get any discussion at at all in the past. 

The predictable result though, is that there's a tendency to wait for the scheduled posts, out of both respect for the read runner and out of laziness.  I want to encourage everyone to post more frequently, independent of the read runner.  That position, in a perfect world, wouldn't be needed at all, the scheduled posts are supposed to act like a pacemaker, not the heart of the discussion.


Getting more lightweight, chatty, exploratory content was the point of the *marginalia* things we were doing for awhile. Having a specific marginalia thread tends to corral those posts in what can become a ghetto, as the reddit UI pushes posts out of sight pretty quickly.  

So, I'm going to start, and I want to encourage others to do it to, posting *ad hoc* marginalia threads -- pretty much in line with what it says in the sidebar.

bookclub,"Ohh, you guys, I have done enough thinking for one day. You are on your own. Here are some questions to think about:

1. Salvador de Madariaga came up with the concept of ""sanchification"" and ""quixotification"" -- basically that DQ and Sancho are becoming each other. Sancho seems to be losing touch with the real world, and in this section he argues with the second barber that the saddlepack is actually *his* because of DQ's batshit ideas about property and conquest. Is DQ becoming more like Sancho, though? Are other characters being influenced by DQ?

1. For all his intentions of creating a satire, Cervantes is also doing a lot of conforming to the literary techniques of his time. My copy says that having a novel-within-a-novel about Moors was common to the books of the time, and I recognize the wildly improbable coincidences from more modern (but still old) writers like Dickens. Also, every single woman of a certain type -- young and lovesick -- is drop dead gorgeous. Is this a clever part of his satire, or is he being completely unironic about all this? *DQ* is so self-aware that I'm having a difficult time deciding what's satire and what isn't.

Our next section is Chapters 46 - 52, which marks the end of Book 1 and the halfway point of this monster! I can't believe it's going so fast. We are due to have our next discussion on Saturday the 12th."

In the meantime! We conclude the section with the novella, Luscinda and Dorotea find solutions to their problems, and Sancho nearly ruins everything. We also start a second detour into the life of ""the captive"", with barely a chance to take a breath between stories.

Thoughts on this section:

Within the larger DQ/Sancho narrative, there's a string of other stories and subplots, and the book seems to be growing in complexity. It's no *Game of Thrones* or *Middlemarch*, but Cervantes is juggling a lot of cause and effect here. He's brought back the barber and the priest from earlier in the story, knitted them in nicely with the madman from the Sierra Moreno, and now it looks like Dorotea and Don Fernando are going to continue to be part of the novel's focus until DQ is delivered into the hands of his niece. It's graceful in some areas and clumsy in others.

There's also a little detour in Chapter 38, where DQ holds court re: arms vs words. This was evidently a popular debate at the time, according to the footnotes in my book. He falls entirely on the side of arms, but what I think is interesting is that he's a man of words: words have influenced and informed his life to the extent that he took up arms because of them. He *looks* like a man of arms at first glance, but he's so articulate in his argument, and so creative in his self-delusion, that I think he's the exact opposite of what he thinks he is. A man of arms should be straightforward; a man of words can be opaque and a contradiction.

Cervantes served as a soldier -- he's a man of both words and arms. How much of DQ's words in Chapter 38 do you think belong to Cervantes? Is he straightforwardly arguing for the superiority of the soldier over the academic, or is he doing something more thoughtful, as befits a man of words?

What grabbed you in this section?"
bookclub,"Hi, all. I don't actually have approval to do this, but I wanted to keep us moving forward on DQ to avoid losing people. I'll do the next section in a couple days (we're supposed to be done with Chapter 39 as of yesterday) unless someone tells me not to.

Interesting stuff this time. Lots of exciting coincidences, and a bonus novella that we get about halfway through. What do you think of the novella? (/u/platykurt, this must be the Shakespearean bit you mentioned last time?) How do you think it relates to the story as a whole, and what's the intention here? In more modern literature, sub-stories (there's probably a better word for them) and other stand-aparts like them usually have the effect of filling in back story, but it seems like Cervantes has kind of slapped this in here.

I'm also struck by the capable, independent women in DQ: we've met Marcela and now Dorotea. This is another way that the modernity of the story surprises me, given how woman are often cardboard cutouts or fawning simpletons in 20th century literature, from pulp science fiction to Philip Roth.

And what about Sancho's growing credulity? He seemed much more skeptical of DQ at the beginning of the novel, but now, close to a third of the way through, he's blinded by the idea of a little bit of land to rule over and he seems to actually think that DQ is going to be an emperor. How is DQ influencing him?

What struck you in particular about this section?"

bookclub,"Sorry for the wait! But here it is--*Death in Venice* by Thomas Mann. 

So, for discussion I want to focus on three major questions I think the book poses. 

First, how to live. What is ""living""? Aschenbach is a successful man, he's an artist, lives an orderly life, has a wife and family, and lives comfortably. One day he suddenly desires to travel. Once in Venice we notice that Aschenbach doesn't really *do* much. He mostly thinks and watches people. The closest he comes to being a part of the living, breathing city (if you could call the city living), is when he is seeking out information about the outbreak of cholera. Is this really living? Did he die happy? Do you think happiness is a concern for Mann? Does happiness = living? Or is it something else? 

Second, what is love and what is friendship? Mann quotes Plato's *Phaedrus* more than once, so it is clearly of interest to him. It's been a few years since I've read *Phaedrus* but I recall that in it Socrates is teaching young Phaedrus about love, specifically eros. In the book, Socrates argues that our souls are like a chariot, pulled by two horses. One horse is calm and restrained, this represents reason and morality. The second horse is passion and is unruly and troublesome and represents our appetites or passions. Thus, Socrates concludes, love is like a kind of madness and constant struggle. (And please do correct any of this if I'm wrong.) Mann is clearly drawing a parallel between Aschenbach/Tadzio and Socrates/Phaedrus. Do you think Aschenbach's soul is one like the one described by Socrates. 

Do you think Tadzio reciprocates Aschenbach's feelings?

Is this love that Aschenbach has for Tadzio? Or something else? What kind of love? 

Third, much of this book focuses on art, beauty and aesthetics. What makes a good artist? What makes something beautiful? How does Aschenbach view art and literature? "
bookclub,"Hi, all! /u/Bompalomp had some life happen, so I'm posting this section of Don Quixote. I won't be at all insightful because I had a busy week too, and I, uh, haven't read it yet. Getting to it after work tomorrow. But here's a space to discuss!

I assume that shenanigans have happened! What do you think of them?"
bookclub,"Hello! Thank you for your patience while I juggle some tricky real life business. 

Now let's jump in!

In these chapters we get to really see Don Quixote and Sancho's relationship. Is it one-sided, meaning do you think Don Quixote abuses him and simply sees him as an errand boy? Or is there some give and take, do you think maybe Sancho also has a caretaker quality that gives him a bit of power? 

There's an interesting section where Sancho asks Don Quixote if they should go to a court so Don Quixote's courageous acts could be noticed and Don Quixote goes through the exact method in which this will happen. During this section where he recounts the path of a knight, he discusses the knight falling in love and marrying a princess. While he's telling a very romantic story, it's very formulaic. What is Cervantes saying about love? Or what is Cervantes saying about love in chivalric novels of the time? 

In another section, Sancho has this great quote ""...such misfortunes are difficult to foresee, and if they come, all you can do is shrug your shoulders, hold your breath, close your eyes, and let yourself go where luck and the blanket take you"" (155-156). To which DQ responds by saying ""You are a bad Christian, Sancho."" What is a good Christian for DQ? What is Cervantes saying about Christianity or DQ's ideal Christianity? 

What else did you find interesting/funny/sad? "
bookclub,Hello everyone! Real life decided to throw a bunch of curve balls at me this week so I'm delaying *Death in Venice* to be on the 9th. DQ will remain on schedule. Thanks for your patience and understanding. 
bookclub,"Some of you are observant AF, but some of you are probably like me, fully capable of enjoying a novel but unlikely to pick up on the stuff below the surface, like symbols and things. Since *Don Quixote* is 400 years old and has been discussed to death and back, I thought I’d take some time this weekend and put together a list of resources to help the literary-device-challenged among us talk like we know what’s up.

Please add to the list! I’d love to see some more critical essays, but I think the majority of what’s out there must either be in book form (Nabokov) or behind university paywalls.

bookclub,"So this is the entirety of Book 2 of Part (or Volume) 1. There's a lot of interesting things starting to develop in these chapters I think and I'm interested to see how they begin to play out. 

To start, Cervantes gave us a huge cliffhanger and at the beginning of chapter 9, he continues prolong the suspense by describing how he came along the Arab Historian who had written down the complete histories of Don Quixote. Once this is accounted for Cervantes returns to the regular schedule program and concludes the fight with the Basque gentleman. We also begin to see a little bit more of Sancho.

All of this is fine and dandy, but then Sancho and DQ meet some goatherds and they here of a scholar nearby who has just died due to heartbreak. 

I wanted to really get into this particular part, because it's really spectacular in my opinion. 

First, I want to ask: why do you think Cervantes presents this story of Grisostomo and Marcela? 

Leading up to the presentation of these characters DQ is telling the goatherds about what it means to be a knight errant and specifically states that his purpose is to ""defend maidens, protect widows, and come to the aid of orphans and those in need."" This seems pretty narrow. 

He then proceeds to discuss with one of the travelers about the devotion a knight has to their lady and whether this is in line with or against religion. He states in no uncertain terms that a knight MUST be devoted to his lady and speaks once more of Dulcinea of Toboso. All of this leads up to Marcela and Grisotomo very nicely I think. What do you think Cervantes is saying about DQ and Dulcinea v. Marcela and Grisotomo? 

Another important part I really want to dig into is Marcela's speech. Woah! I was blown away. Lots of beautiful rhetoric. ""The limits of my desires are these mountains, and if they go beyond here, it is to contemplate the beauty of the heaven and the steps whereby the soul travels to its first home."" ""I was born free.... I am a distant fire and a far-off sword."" Those are just two lines I really liked but there's definitely a lot to unpack in her speech and I want to hear your reactions. 

This section ends with DQ determining to seek out Marcela offer to serve her. I wonder what this means about his knightly code and Dulcinea. I wonder if Cervantes is going to use the remainder of the book taking his ridiculous moral codes framed by exaggerated literature and unravel them slowly. I don't know. 

Thoughts?"
bookclub,"This question has plagued me for years. I used to not read reviews at all. I'd just read a book that seemed interesting. However, ever since discovering Goodreads and developing a large collection of ""to-read"" books, I have begun reading reviews on books that interest me. However, if I see a bad review on a book, I've realized that it seems to make me skeptical on the contents within and that I have less patience when reading through it. 

What do you think?"
bookclub,"This part begins with a debate of whih books deserve to be preserved and which should be thrown into the fire. Near the end of this chapter they even discuss Cervantes, deciding to spare his work because ""His book has certain creativity."" 

I found it interesting that Cervantes felt comfortable commenting on his own works. 

The story continues and Don Quixote somehow convinces Sancho to accompany him as his squire. Sancho is an interesting character and I'd like to hear what others' thoughts of him are. He seems sane and rational in some ways, he realizes that the windmills are only windmills, but he also has a high regard and deep trust of Don Quixote. 

One of my favorite Sancho moments is when he tries to ""loot"" the friar's body but is beaten to a pulp. 

What thoughts did you have? Things you noticed?"
bookclub,I am struggling to find the information of July's book. I would like to participate again if possible. Can someone point me in the right direction?
bookclub,"Richard Yates, in a 1972 interview, stated that *Revolutionary Road* was about ""abortions of all kinds."" I thought this was an interesting blurb from that interview on that subject/theme:

&gt;Everything gets aborted in the book. That was supposed to be the theme of the book. I remember when I was first working on it and feeling my way into it, somebody at a party asked me what I was writing a novel about, and I said I thought I was writing a novel about abortion. And the guy said what do you mean by that? And I said, it’s going to be built on a series of abortions, of all kinds—an aborted play, several aborted careers, any number of aborted ambitions and aborted plans and aborted dreams—all leading up to a real, physical abortion, and a death at the end. And maybe that’s about as close to a real summation of the book as I’ve ever come.

What did you think about the last 3 chapters? Do you think it was, as Frank alludes, a suicide? Or was it an unfortunate consequence of a self-inflicted abortion? Does April's note make it definitive either way? What about the notes she had started to write but burned up?

bookclub,"In the previous chapters concerning Kafka, the story is written in the first person, but in chapter 31, at one moment (location 5287 on my Kindle), it switches to the second person. What do you think the reason is?

I put my arm around her.
You put your arm around her."
bookclub,"This book is already better than I expected honestly! I'm laughing out loud and also thinking really deeply about the situation. 

There's plenty to talk about, but to start I'm just going to pose a few questions about what we've read so far. 

First, the Author's prologue and the sonnets before the beginning tell us a lot about Cervantes. What does it say about him? What does it say about Don Quixote? How does it prepare us for the book? 

In the first chapter we're introduced to the man, (soon to be) Don Quixote. Cervantes says that 
&gt; In short, our gentleman became so caught up in reading that he spent his nights reading from dusk till dawn and his days reading from sunrise to sunset, and so with too little sleep and too much reading his brains dried up, causing him to lose his mind.

What is Cervantes saying about reading? I mean, he's an author, this feel strange for him to be saying this. 

In the following Chapters Don Quixote begins to set out on his quest to right wrongs and bring justice to the world. How do you feel about how he's going bought this ""noble"" quest? 

Everyone he meets claims that he's just ""crazy."" Is he in fact crazy? Why is he crazy? Is there more to it than simply reading too much?

In my version Harold Bloom has a lovely introduction and states that Cervantes and Shakespeare were the two pillars of Western Literature and he goes into trying to compare and contrast the two authors. He brings up frequently the contrast between Hamlet and Don Quixote. I thought it'd be interesting to continue to look at this while we read. 

So, to start, I noticed that both Hamlet and Don Quixote are set forth on a quest or a mission to ""right wrongs."" And they both are perceived as insane as they begin to pursue their goals. What other similarities or differences are there between the two?
"
bookclub,"I really enjoyed these three chapters! Chapter 4 focused a lot on superficial things like appearance and clothing. Yates describes this scene with Maureen greeting Frank to her apartment in the nude so well: with her ""falling heavily into his arms and knocked the wind out of him"" while being ""drenched"" in perfume and with heavily-mascara'd lashes that were ""as thick and ragged as a spider's leg."" Frank is described twice trying to get away from her kisses as being ""released"" from her mouth and with ""the desperation of a drowning man in his upward struggle."" This does not sound sexy at all.

In comparison, there is a great section about Frank taking a shower and getting dressed:

&gt;He took a long, voluptuously warm shower and spent a long time brushing and combing his hair. In the bedroom, he inspected three shirts before deciding on the one he would wear with his tight, clean khakis- an expensive cotton flannel in a dark green-and-black plaid- and he tried several ways of wearing it before he settled on folding its cuffs back twice, turning its collar up in back and leaving it unbuttoned halfway down his chest...he used [April's] handmirror to check the way the collar looked from the side and to test the effect, in profile, of his tightening jaw muscle.

I don't know what it was about it but I was just really drawn to the descriptions. It's very suave and crisp, a much more sexy image to envision (a man getting dressed in nice clothes compared to the nude Maureen scene), and (again) emphasizes a theme that's been brought up in discussion comments about looking at oneself in a mirror (I feel like this happens all the time in this book, right?).

Cementing the attention to appearance and clothing in this chapter was the advertisement on the radio about the Fall Clearance at Robert Hall's men's fashion store. This was interjected between April and Frank's conversation about her not caring about him and his insistence that she *must* love him. 

I don't think we can discuss these chapters without mention of John Givings in Chapter 5. It was such a relief to see a character with so much 'truth-telling.' Some little quips I loved:

&gt;You mean you didn't even ask? People's all set to do something as big as that and then they drop the whole idea, and you don't even ask what the deal is? Why?

&gt;Don't people have babies in Europe?

&gt;I wouldn't be surprised if you knocked her up on purpose, **just so you could spend the rest of your life hiding behind that maternity dress.**

April and Frank's epic fight in Chapter 6 was really intense. The part that stood out the most was when April went into the woods in the backyard and he followed her. She asks him to leave or she'll scream; he leaves not because it's what she wants but because ""if she screamed here on the hillside they would hear her in every house in Revolutionary Road. They would hear her all over the top of the Hill, too, and in the Campbell's house."" I liked the imagery of Frank sitting in a dark room watching her; he sees the ""yellow flare as she lit a cigarette, and then he watched the tiny red coal of it move in the slow arcs of her smoking."" Just such a perfect description of something so small and not very significant.

What did you like?"
bookclub,"Hello /r/bookclub! Since we're about to endeavor on a journey of a bunch of shorter works of literature (novellas and short stories) I wanted to try to have one big Marginalia for all of our short summer reads. 

This will allow us to continue using a marginalia as we have been, to make notes or point out quotes or symbols or insights as we read, but also to allow us to connect all the books we read together. 

My goal is that this marginalia will allow for conversation to foster regarding reoccurring themes or topics that we witness throughout the different short reads.

Anyways, I'm so very very excited to read this with everyone. It's been something I've wanted to read for a long time and it sounds like others feel the same way. I think it'll be a very good read. 

I've organized it so it's stretched out over the next 3 months and there's about 50-70 pages of reading every 5 days.

So here it is (And I will update the sidebar with these dates as well). Let me know if there's any thing confusing. I know a lot of editions might be organized a little differently and I'm happy to help anyone navigate this. 

EDIT/UPDATE: I will be using/I am recommending Edith Grossman's translation, but other great translations are Burton Raffel, Samuel Putnam, and Tobias Smollett. Of these Edith Grossman's is probably the most readable based on the English language that is used today.

bookclub,"I'm so very excited about what we've decided to read for our first short reads. 

To start I'm going to have space of 15 days between each discussion. If I feel like we can do every 10 days I'll include more nominations, but I feel like this is a good start while we're balancing *Don Quixote* as well. 

So, our first discussion will be about ***Death in Venice* by Thomas Mann** on **July 5th**

On **July 20th** we'll discuss ***Ficciones* by Jorge Luis Borges**

I don't know what versions everyone has, but *Ficciones* is a particular SET of short stories (1st version published in 1944). I will list the title of each story below to make sure we're all reading the same works. *Ficciones* is made up of two parts and they are as follows:

Part One: The Garden of Forking Paths

* Prologue
* Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius
* The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim
* Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote
* The Circular Ruins
* The Lottery in Babylon
* An Examination of the Work of Herbert Quain
* The Library of Babel
* The Garden of Forking Paths

Part Two: Artifices

* Prologue
* Funes the Memorious
* The Form of the Sword
* Theme of the Traitor and the Hero
* Death and the Compass
* The Secret Miracle
* Three Versions of Judas
* The End
* The Sect of the Phoenix
* The South 



I'm particularly excited to read Borges. I just started reading his short works this year and I'm particularly excited to be reading Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote while actually reading Don Quixote. 

Personal Note: I'm also really excited because I just realized that I've owned Borges since I was very young. I purchased his *Book of Imaginary Beings* when I was little, but I'm only just now making the connection between this book and his short stories. "
bookclub,"Part 3 opens with a short meditation on time - starting with the allusion to the military captain setting his watch to synchronize with wartime artillery - and we see a continued focus on time as Frank and April set up their own kind of battle. Frank refers to each of their efforts as a ""campaign"" re: the argument for/against a self-induced abortion. The actual physical calendar reminds them of their deadline, as each work with a false sense of civility to prove their side. There is a lot of attention paid to how time can ferment orderliness; the business executive trying to remember a particular year for an event so that ""now all the other years can fall obediently into place"" or when Frank and April are figuring out how to approach each other after Frank finds the syringe and they look to the calendar that ""row on row of logical, orderly days lay waiting for intelligent use between now and the deadline.""

What did you think about the detailed and calculated way Frank made his arguments? He places a lot of emphasis on what's ""right,"" ""moral,"" ""mature,"" and ""conventional."" April is more emotional and argues about what she feels.

I liked Yates' language about restraint and anxious energy in these chapters. I first noticed it with Frank, in chapter 1 (pg 235), when he ""held his jaws shut and stared at his glass, which he gripped until it was nearly spilled with trembling"" in order to maintain his composure and not ruin his campaign. Shep, in chapter 2 (pg 249), on the news that the Wheelers are staying in the US - though he's been trying to get April off his mind - drinking ""a tremulous sip of gin and tonic that brought the ice cubes clicking painfully against his front teeth."" Also, Mrs. Givings, when learning the Wheelers are staying but also dealing with issues re: John (Ch. 2, pg 253), is doodling stars on her calendar ""with such furious pressure that their joyful shapes were embossed on all the pages underneath."" 

What do you think this says about the characters, always living up to some social constraint rather than acting/speaking as they feel? Did it make you sense the underlying tension while reading? I felt all the characters to be so on edge and I think Yates created that sense perfectly, especially in contrast to (or, to fall in line with) the imagery in the very beginning of Part 3 of orderliness and consistency. 

There was a lot going on in these chapters - April and Shep, Frank rekindling his affair with Maureen, how everyone approaches the news of their pregnancy and not moving to Paris. What parts of the story did you like best? "
bookclub,"This summer we'll be reading ***Don Quixote* by Cervantes** this summer, this will be stretched out throughout the new couple of months. 

For the next couple of weeks we'll be reading ***Ficciones* by Borges** and ***Death in Venice* by Mann** 

I'll be posting the schedule for the discussions of these books tomorrow, so keep an eye open for that. 

Also, if you are interested in being a read runner for any of these selections please message me and let me know. 

Very excited to read all of these books with everyone!"
bookclub,"Hello everyone! Hope you are enjoying the book. What do you like most about this story so far? 

At the end of Part 2 April's bombshell news is that she is pregnant. Paris in the Fall is effectively canceled. 

Were you surprised at Frank's reaction to the news? He is trying to portray ""the look of a man stunned by bad news"" but had an ""exultant smile... snuggling up for freedom from his chest."" If it wasn't more clear how happy Frank is at the news, Yates describes his head that ""hung aching with joy over [April's] shoulder"" as he stood comforting her. And finally:

&gt;The pressure was off; life had come mercifully back to normal.

But Frank isn't happy at the pregnancy itself so much as he is happy that the pregnancy is the excuse he needed. He finds the rubber syringe and knows what it's for; he confronts April and she snaps that he can't stop her. He knows she doesn't want the baby so this becomes the second time a baby foiled their plans and he has to condemn April's desire to force a miscarriage/get an abortion. 

Re: the idea of family, do you think April and Frank are good parents? There's a scene in Ch. 5 that upset me when April snaps at Jennifer, and they later find her:

&gt;They got up and went together to the children's room, and there she was, lying down an staring at nothing, with her thumb in her mouth.

When Frank tries to express that the move to Europe might be hard on the kids, April accuses him of ""emotionalistic nonsense"" and drops the kids off at the Campbell's while they host the Givings ""an hour or two earlier than necessary.""

It reminded me of phrasing Shep used in Chapter 2, about their life - in an ugly suburban house - that needed to be ""apologized for in terms of the job and kids."" Kids have operated so far in this novel as burdens and excuses. How does this contrast to images we see of the 1950s (for example, ""Leave it to Beaver"") or what family life is supposed to be like? 

What did you like/dislike about these chapters? What do you expect in the last third of the book? I am hoping to see more of John Givings- I really liked his character."
bookclub,"The first third of *Revolutionary Road* focused securely on Frank and April Wheeler: their relationship, their house, their friends/neighbors, their jobs/lifestyle. The narration favored Frank's perspective, and what we were able to see of their relationship was mostly through his eyes. In Part 2 we see Yates turn the focus toward two other characters: Shep Campbell in Ch. 2 and Mrs. Givings in Ch. 3. 

What do you think it means for Yates to bypass April Wheeler and focus on these peripheral characters? April started out as our starlet - the ""lovely"" and ""so good"" lead actress of *The Petrified Forest* in Part 1/Ch.1 - yet remains a behind-the-scenes, 'supporting actress' type of character whose turn at narration has so far been avoided.

What were some of your favorite parts in this section? I personally liked the way Yates is able to write about relationships and I noticed some really beautiful but heartbreaking scenes in these first three chapters. 

By including the Campbell's and the Givings' marriages (although briefly, in just one chapter each), Yates showed similarities to the hopelessness and failed expectations we had seen with Frank and April. In Ch. 2, Shep appreciates his wife's ability to make their ""ugly, efficient suburban house"" appealing, but describes their bedroom (perhaps a metaphor for their marriage?) in less appealing terms:

&gt;""...this bedroom was not a very sophisticated place...It's windows served less as windows than as settings for puffed effusions of dimity curtains, and the matching dimity skirts of its bed and dressing table fell in overabundant pleats and billows to the carpet. It was a room that might have been dreamed by a little girl alone with her dolls and obsessed with the notion of making things nice for them among broken orange crates and scraps of cloth in a secret shady corner of the backyard."" 

Just prior to denigrating her sophistication and comparing her to a little girl, Shep reflects on why he married Milly and says ""maybe he'd married her for reasons that were hard to remember and maybe it wasn't the most romantic marriage in the world."" A few pages later he smells something ""rancid"" on his wife (likely just her natural scent that he isn't attracted to) and we learn that Shep still fantasizes about a time he was dancing with April Wheeler:

&gt;""Oh, she was sweating, all right, and the smell of her was as strong and clean as lemons; it was the smell of her as much as the tall rhythmic feel of her that had made his - that had made him want to - oh, Jesus. It had happened nearly a year ago, and the memory of it could still make his fingers tremble in the buttoning of his shirt."" 

I had never really thought about Mrs. Givings as anything other than a busybody, but Yates' description of her at the end of Ch.3 was so revealing:

&gt;""She cried because she'd had such high, high hopes about the Wheelers tonight and now she was terribly, terribly, terribly disappointed. She cried because she was fifty-six years old and her feet were ugly and swollen and horrible; she cried because none of the girls had liked her at school and none of the boys had liked her later; she cried because Howard Givings was the only man who'd ever asked her to marry him, and because she'd done it, and because her only child was insane."" 

Later we learn that Howard Givings turned off his hearing aid to tune her out, and we see that neither family - The Wheelers, The Campbells, or the Givings - appear happy in their married lives. 

After reading more about Mrs. Givings in Ch.3, did you like her any better than she had previously been presented? Did you learn any more about April from either Shep Campbell or Mrs. Givings? How were these new perspectives different than how we have viewed April from Frank's perspective? 

Looking forward to reading your thoughts about this (or any) part of the book so far :)

bookclub,"Hello everyone - thank you for the great conversation/discussion for the first few chapters of Revolutionary Road! Instead of any direct questions this time, let's discuss whatever was most interesting to you in this second half of Part One.

What I found interesting in this second half were some of the side-by-side images/scenes that Yates uses to perpetuate an up/down ""emotional roller coaster"" feeling I had while reading. Most prominent for me was in Chapter 4 when Frank is reading comics with his kids but after a while starts to lose it, questioning his life (""What the hell kind of life was this? What in God's name was the point or the meaning or the purpose of a life like this?"") and wishes he could pick up the chair and throw it through the picture window. 

Based on our conversations this week about what the picture window or house represents, I found this to be a brilliant analogy on Yates' part to Frank wanting out of whatever life/relationship he has. This shift from reading to your kids to throwing things through the window was sudden and shocking and could explain how tumultuous Frank actually feels inside, all while trying to remain cool on the outside. The idea of shattering your domestic existence (if we use the picture window as a metaphor) was kind of foreshadowing for Frank's affair with Maureen.

Another transition I liked comes after his interlude with Maureen when he is riding the commuter train back home to his family in Chapter 6. His triumph of conquest after his affair is juxtaposed with this picture-perfect family scene with his wife and kids singing Happy Birthday. 

We've talked about gender briefly in regard to April cutting the lawn (""man's work"") and the power struggle between husband/wife roles, but there is a really interesting section at the end of Chapter 6 about what it means to Frank to be a man: 

&gt;""Could a man ride home in the rear smoker, primly adjusting his pants at the knees to protect their crease and rattling his evening paper into a narrow panel to give his neighbor elbow room? Could a man sit meekly massaging his headache and allowing himself to be surrounded by the chatter of **beaten, amiable husks of men** who sat and swayed and played bridge in a stagnant smell of newsprint and tobacco and bad breath and overheated radiators?

&gt;Hell, no. The way for a man to ride was **erect and out in the open, out in the loud iron passageway where the wind whipped his necktie,** standing with his feet set wide apart on the shuddering, clangoring floorplates..."" etc. 

I love the word choices Yates uses here (the bolded parts) to express Frank's versions of masculinity the ""husks"" of men compared to a more adventurous man riding out in the open. He compares himself to a lion, or an eagle- animals that portray strength, honor, bravery, and loyalty when he is actually disloyal and dishonorable by committing this adultery. There are also elements here of self-deception, which I think can be linked to other examples in the novel and specifically to how Frank and April view and gossip about their neighbors while not realizing they are part of the society they are critiquing. 

There's a lot to unpack re: Frank's psyche in these chapters, and just as much to look at with April and her plan to move to Paris. There are also many excellent passages re: the night with the Campbells, gossiping, and Frank's failed storytelling. I am looking forward to see what passages and moments spoke to you the most! "
bookclub,"Hello everyone!

We're going to kick off our summer reading program with nominations for a long summer read and then in another thread we'll be nominating/voting for short stories/novellas.

      I said so .etc. Here is a synopsis from Goodreads: "
bookclub,"I hope I am not breaking the rules by making this, if so, I sincerely apologise. I was reading revolutionary road on kindle and it just didn't feel right. I received a 100 dollar gift card from amazon a month ago and decided to order it as a hard copy:

http://i.imgur.com/PTvFnJC.jpg

This copy comes with a nice string as a book mark as well as a couple of other works by Yates. Who knows! Maybe some of these other works will become a reading choice in the future.

I appreciate online books and such, but I do love physical copies. I try not to buy so many atm because I have so many books and no space. I will be moving soon and once I do I am going to pick up a few more shelves so that I can have physical books galore."
bookclub,"I was noticing the house and how it's described in Chapters Two and Three. The first thing they say on seeing the house is that they hate the picture window. Their distaste for it seems symbolic. I wasn't sure I knew 100% what it was, but when I looked it up I found this: ""Picture windows are fixed windows that do not open. They are usually installed in difficult to reach places to let in light."" Maybe that's going to be symbolic of their willingness to let others into their marriage -- they don't want any light into it? Light comes into it without their wanting it there? Something about openness? Then you have Frank on the side of the road again, play-acting that nothing is wrong for the benefit of the people passing by.

Check out the house layout. Right angles, symmetry, flawless, free of mildew and splinters and cockroaches and grit. Does the house symbolize their marriage and has it changed along with it? It seems like a different animal in the present, when they walk in and turn the light on. ""In the first shock of light [the living room] seemed to be floating, all its contents adrift, and even after it held still it had a tentative look.""

In Chapter Three we hear about house maintenance. Frank has slept in while April is getting up and doing something that's supposed to be his job. Mrs. Givings (I wonder why that name) comes and gives him a box of some kind of ground cover, but he doesn't understand her when she tells him what to do with it. Then we hear about the path he's trying to make, which is meant to direct visitors from the kitchen, and turns out to be complicated and a lot more tedious and more trouble than he thought. We get another direct comparison to their marriage: ""...he could look down and see his house the way a house ought to look on a fine spring day, safe on its carpet of green, the frail white sanctuary of a man's love, a man's wife and children."" Then he admires himself, lol. And then the work on the path all goes wrong.

Did anyone notice any other house-marriage/family parallels? I'm curious about whether Yates will keep comparing the two, and whether something is going to happen to the house if their marriage dissolves."
bookclub,"Hello everyone~ I hope you are enjoying the first few chapters of this book! I have enjoyed reading the comments in the marginalia and know that there are a lot of interesting things to discuss within these few short chapters. I have a few questions/points to get us started but would love to discuss anything you have noticed so far. 

1). Some thoughts regarding narration, writing style, etc: What do you think of the way that Yates is narrating the story, particularly with the transitions between present action and Frank's past memories? Do you like this style or is it confusing? I've read in several places that this novel is often cited as a masterpiece of realistic fiction - how do you like the author's style of word choice, setting a scene/tone, and portraying characters?

2) Some thoughts regarding society and achieving that 1950s ideal of perfection: One of my favorite sections was from Chapter 1 when all the townspeople were gathering in the auditorium for the play; the narrator describes:

&gt;""The main thing, though, was not the play itself but the company - the brave idea of it, the healthy, hopeful sound of it: the birth of a really good community theatre right here, among themselves. This was what had drawn them, enough of them to fill more than half the auditorium, and it was what held them hushed and tense in readiness for pleasure as the house lights dimmed."" 

I found this to be a slightly caustic commentary by Yates on social conformity and living up to a certain image. These people sound really pleased with themselves, for doing nothing other than attending a play and participating in some ""culture."" Did you notice any other similar scenes? I also liked the word choice Yates used when describing their house on Revolutionary Road in Chapter 2- describing the ""suburban look of this too-symmetrical living room"" though it was appealing; ""straight and true,"" ""perfect balance,"" ""flawless bathroom."" Why do you think there is so much attention to how things appear?

3) Do you like any of the characters in the book so far? Why or why not?

4) When Frank wakes up hungover in Chapter 3, he finds that April is mowing the lawn ""wearing a man's shirt and loose flopping slacks."" Later when he is building his stone path he describes it as ""man's work"" and envisions April as the kind of woman who desires only to be a ""sensible middle-class housewife"" with ""a husband who would get out and cut the grass once in a while, instead of sleeping all day."" Frank plans to get dressed and ""take the lawnmower away from her, by force if necessary, in order to restore as much balance to the morning as possible."" What is Yates expressing here by having April wear a man's outfit and do something Frank thinks he should be doing? What is the connection between distinguishing ""man's work"" and the memory Frank reverts to about the time he and April learned they were pregnant? Do you think Frank is right, that April wants to be a housewife, or do you think she is resentful of her current lifestyle? April's unconventional nature and resistance to gender roles/stereotypes might be something to revisit throughout the novel.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts about the book :)"
bookclub,"Hi all -- a couple months ago I started looking for someone to take on the role of ""lead"" mod, and u/bompalomp has stepped forward.  Bompalomp will set the direction, chose parameters for voting, enlist read-runners, etc.  

There are a number of active mods now, so you'll still see signs of us, but we'll take cues from bompalomp for now.  I'm going to keep doing LBSOSLP, the poetry series, and I expect other series will arise in months to come.

Thanks everyone for participating, and thanks also to those who've visited and read, without posting.  And thanks to my predecessor main mod, /u/bkugotit, who lasted 2 or 3 times longer than I did!



"
bookclub,"So /u/Satanspanties suggested a wonderful idea for the summer months and we're going to try to implement it and see how it goes! For the upcoming months instead of doing 2 novels a month we're going to do some short reads! Novellas, short stories, etc. We're going to have a new novella or group of short stories every two weeks and a discussion on what we've read every two weeks. My goal is that we'll get through 2-4 novellas/group of short works a month.

Along with these short reads we're also going to have a big long summer read! 

I'm going to post nominations and votes up soon for the first two novellas/short stories and for the longer read. So keep an eye out for that. More details to come. 

Until then I've composed a list of some potential summer short reads. I'm not as familiar with contemporary literature, so that's definitely something missing from my list and I would LOVE more of it. It's just a list to get you thinking about some options, but please go beyond this list when it comes time for nominations. For this we're going to limit books to 250 pages. 

If we chose short stories I'd like to focus on several short stories by one author so we can maybe get a broader sense of their work in some shorter formats!

If you have any comments or suggestions regarding this please let me know.

bookclub,"I'm so sorry for my absence and the delay, but I'm so excited to see that there's been a lot of discussion happening in my absence. 

I figured this would be a nice post to wrap everything up and really talk about some of those really important climatic moments, but also look back at some of the themes and discussions we addressed early on and think about how it all fits together now.

To start I'm going to go through questions about chapters 11-15 then some broad questions about the whole book.

Chapter 11
In this Chapter Snowman runs into a large group of pigoons and he hides in a guard watchtower. He finds some provisions and plots how to escape. But one of the most interesting passages is when he decides to fiddle with a radio and he hears a human voice--although it's in a language Snowman does not know. This begins to give us hope for humanity. 
What do you think this means for humanity? Even if there are survivors is there any hope? 

Another great part of this chapter is when he asks 
&gt;If I'd killed Crake earlier, thinks Snowman, would it have made any difference? 
This is when it's revealed to us that Snowman killed Crake, but we're not sure the extent of why or what Crake did. 
Do you think it would have changed anything? 

In this chapter he is also dreaming of his mother once again in the magenta robe. This is frightening and empty. Why do you think this vision keeps coming back to him? And why do you think Atwood choose now for it to reappear? To provide a bit more context, in the previous chapter Jimmy watched the death of his mother.

Chapter 12
Crake arrives at Jimmy's apartment and offers Jimmy a job as head of advertising for BlyssPluss. Crake also introduces Jimmy to the ""Crakers."" We also finally get a clear view of Oryx, but she still seems hard to grasp. She's Crake's lady, but professes that Jimmy makes her feel a different way and definitely prioritizes Jimmy. Jimmy also becomes very paranoid that Crake ""knows"" about Oryx and Jimmy. 

Then the climax happens.
The human population is being demolished by a virus that we find out is do to Crake's BlyssPluss pills. Ultimately Crake tells Jimmy that he is counting on him, slits Oryx's throat, and is killed by Jimmy. 

Why do you think Crake killed Oryx? What was his plan? What does he hope or expect Jimmy to do? 

Chapter 13
In chapter 13 Alex the parrot reappears in a dream to Jimmy. 
What do you think the significance of Alex is. Why does he continue to reappear? Why is he reappearing now? 

Jimmy begins to consider what to do with the Crakers. He feels obligated to care for them, because of Oryx. Jimmy also finds a brief letter he wrote out that describes the events that led to the annihilation of the human race. After reading this he states:
&gt; It's the fate of these words to be eaten by beetles. He could have mentioned the change in Crake's fridge magnets. You could tell a lot about a person from their fridge magnets, not that he'd thought much about them at the time. 

To remind you, these are the fridge magnet's Crake had when Jimmy saw him at Paradice:
&gt;Where God is, Man is not.
There are two moons, the one you can see and the one you can't.
Du musz dein Leben andern. [You must change your life] 
We understand more than we know.
I think, therefore. 
To stay human is to break a limitation. Dream steals from its lair towards its prey.     

What do these magnets say about Crake and how did it foreshadow what Crake would do? 

This chapter also shows the great care Jimmy takes to guiding the Crakers and caring for them. 
Why do you think he treats them the way he does? He makes up myths and stories to help them understand the world. Why? Why do you think he has an obligation to them? Do you think Oryx would still want them tended to after she learned the reality of Crake's plans? 

Chapter 14 
Snowman returns to the Crakers and finds that they have learned some odd habits that seem religious in nature. 
How do you think they gained these ideas? How did they develop despite Crake's care in designing them. 
Snowman also learns that there are more humans.

Chapter 15
Snowman sets out to find the humans and we see a huge dilemma in his mind. Whether he should kill the humans to protect the Crakers or not. He questions whether it is the right thing--the moral thing. Ultimately, the book is left vague as to his decision.

What do you think Snowman decided? Why?

Overall book questions:
The last line of the book is ""Zero hour, Snowman thinks. Time to go""
This concept of the zero hour was presented at the beginning and now again at the end. We mentioned it a bit before, but what do you think the significance of the zero hour is? How does that play into what you believe Snowman decides? 

What is Atwood saying about the tension between art, religion, language, literature and science, technology, experimentation, logic, medicine? 

What is Atwood saying about morality? Snowman isn't particularly *moral*, but he's not immoral like Crake was. Do morals matter? 

Let me know what else you'd like to discuss, because this book is definitely rich with topics to discuss, but my post is getting a little lengthy. 
"
bookclub,"I noticed a few possible and a few clear bible references -- full-book spoilers, nothing very specific though:

The Rockulators, with the marketing possibility of ""Hit it with a rod""

Most obviously the full-book concept of Crake designing a ~~race~~ limited version of himself to inhabit the world.

Maybe the players of Extinctathon naming themselves, is that like Adam naming animals?  They call themselves Madaddam...

Coming back from his foray, Jimmy/Snowman toys with telling the Crakers he saw crake in a burning bush

Others?  Do these flavor the book in any way for you?  For me, mere references to a Goddy cosmos change it from   science-fiction to mystic/historic/cultural fiction -- that is, in Oryx and Crake, I don't see science as an autonomous force but as a tool is a cosmic drama."
bookclub,"At the risk of stressing the superficial, I noticed last night the similarity in our two May selections:  both feature a key character who consciously judges mankind and seeks a diagnosis and prescription for a cure.


It seems to me there's a basic difference in their (JB's and Crake's) assessment: Crake seems to think of evil as arising systemically (toward the end: once you get symbolic thought it's all over) -- whereas J.B. sees it as us being individually culpable for sentimentality, greed, sloppy reasoning, false consciousness.

I'd be interested in digging out how this position of making judgement shapes the books *as novels* -- it might seem so fundamental that it's hard to discuss, like asking ""how does language shape shakespeare's work"" or ""what effect does irony have in Vonnegut"".   For these two books, there wouldn't be any novel if the judgement wasn't there.

The theme of judging and damning one's peers will be relevant in Revolutionary Road, too.

What about previous books we've read, looking back over [previous selections](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/wiki/previous), do you remember other narrators or authors taking similar stances?  That is, explaining (or explaining away) the wickedness of society? "
bookclub,"What questions do you have for the mods?  What do you think we should do to improve the sub?  Are there projects you'd like to take on, or see someone else take on?  

Back in February or March, we had a peak of activity, with four books going at a time.  For me, that felt overwhelming, but I never heard complaints -- did you guys like that?   I felt responsible for keeping up with everything and couldn't do it.

The most significant development from my perspective in the last few months is that we've had a steady stream of volunteers to lead discussions.  I want to encourage that, and anyone who might be interested should consider volunteering as [Read Runner](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/wiki/readrunner).   As it says there, in my vision of the sub, the read-runners wouldn't be so prominent, because there'd be a lot of spontaneous posting by readers.  But so far, it's still unusual for people to start threads on their own, and having a rotation of read-runners lets the sub keep constant activity -- and activity begets activity, content gives rise to content.

Remember the option that you can unilaterally start a read of any book/part of  a book/combination of books we've ever selected in the past: see [The Evergreen Rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/wiki/evergreen).

On the conversations I've led, I didn't get in great questions Dead Souls and The Fall, which was a shame because I enjoyed them both more than I expected too -- lately I've had to snatch minutes to post anything, and haven't done any coherent writing.  I expect over the next six months we'll see another mod take over most of the announcements that I've been doing.  Anyway, don't take my recent  reads as models -- I think the best one I led was White  Noise.

Meta posts are always fine on this sub --  if you want to start a separate thread about anything about the sub, covered here or not, that's always okay."

bookclub,"From my perspective, Crake has wanted to destroy the world and build a new one ever since childhood. He has seen how terrible the world is, and he understands it, and he wants to fix it. And so he makes better life, people who won't rape or murder or abuse kids or destroy the planet.

I think Crake is a hero. He destroyed the bad world and made a new, compassionate, beautiful one."
bookclub,"Thanks for nominating and voting -- as usual,  the nominations were all interesting books.   Mason and Dixon seems promising for  a future big read, and every one of  the nominations  is on my personal to-read or read-again list.

The selected book for June is **Revolutionary Road** by Richard Yates.  Marginalia thread will  go up next week, and a schedule will be announced when  . . . 


As usual, the call now goes for volunteers to lead the discussion.  If you might be interested in setting the schedule and choosing some discussion topics, the description of the role  is  [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/wiki/readRunner).   

If Revolutionary Road doesn't tickle your fancy, keep an eye out for  coming announcements about novella series to run over the summer."
bookclub,"Thank you guys for keeping up the wonderful discussion for this really great book. 

Chapter 9 focuses on Snowman's journey to seek out food and perhaps weapons. 

During this chapter he recalls a conversation with Crake about how humanity is now ""too complicated"" and if one generation was eliminated, they would not be able to go on. They could not have a second bronze or iron age. Humanity would cease to continue on. Humanity has survived a lot. Do you think Crake is right about this? Or do you think humanity is stronger than Crake believes?

In Chapter 10 the focus is on Jimmy's life after college and specifically his job at AnooYoo. 

During his relationship with Amanda he received a job offer at AnooYoo and he says that he was already ""rehearsing his exit lines."" Some times people go into a relationship with the expectation of it failing. Is this mindset by Jimmy fair to Amanda? What does it say about Jimmy? Perhaps he's not as kind and nice as he likes to think of himself. Maybe it's because he compares himself to Crake. 

Speaking of Crake, it is becoming clear that Jimmy and Crake are growing apart. Do you think this is what leads Crake into darker experiments and projects that ""cross boundaries"" as Jimmy said in chapter 8? 

We also find out in chapter 10 that Jimmy's mother was executed. After he witnesses the video of his mother he becomes restless, irritable, depressed. Even sex and women became boring and uninteresting to him. Why do you think it had such a profound effect? For a long time he's seemed indifferent regarding his mother and mostly upset about Killer. How did these new emotions get stirred up? "
bookclub,"Going thru my notes on **Dead Souls**, I remembered something I meant
to post about -- Manilov fantasizing about having Chichikov as  a
life-long friend.  The passages are ironic in that the reader is
already aware Chichikov is a trickster and probably a loony.

But Manilov's fantasy is touching -- he takes an immediate comfort
in imagining the two of them living together by a river, and a bridge
being built.

Of other  books we've read recently, or among [previous selections](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/wiki/previous),
what depictions are there of adult friendship?  I  think  of **White
Noise**,  there's  this potential of  friendship between Gladney and
Murray, but that never blossoms into emotional closeness,  it seems like
they're  allied against  the Cultural Studies people.

In **The Fall**, J.B. regards friendships as disposable commodities.

What interesting scenes or passages of  memorable relations can think of among what we've read? Does the  author use them to  drive plot/theme, or is depicting the friendships and end in itself?
"
bookclub,"Sorry for the delay! 

So, a few things to think about and a few questions I have to prompt conversation!

In Chapter 7, Snowman decides to set out on a journey to find more food and work on improving his situation. In this chapter we also get a better understanding of Crake's children. 

How do you feel about how Crake has designed these humans? To me they seem empty, but Crake has clearly thought out these humans very thoroughly. 

One of the parts that struck me the most in this chapter though is when Snowman is recalling a conversation about Art with Crake. Crake says that Art is 
&gt;  A stab at getting laid

And 
&gt; Female artists are biologically confused.

Do you think Crake is right, that art is just to serve this biological purpose? 

In Chapter 8, Snowman reflects on his memories of Crake and life after high school. Jimmy and Crake have gone separate ways, but stay in touch. 

Some notable moments from this chapter:

Crake introduces Jimmy to a bunch of different projects at Watson-Crick Institute and Jimmy feels like a boundary has been crossed. What boundary? Has it in fact been crossed?

Also we see that while Jimmy has been focused on the picture of Oryx throughout the years, so has Crake. In this way we begin to notice their competing interests in her. How do you think this plays out in the end? Clearly Jimmy and Oryx were close, but it seems like Oryx and Crake were also close. 

Finally, Crake introduces to Jimmy a hidden level of Extinctathon. What do you think the Grandmasters are doing? Crake thinks that 
&gt; they're after the machinery. They're after the whole system, they want to shut it down. 

What do you think this means? What system? Do you think Crake wants to be a part of this?     "
bookclub,"
A first person narrator is a lot more likely to pull you in, at least
initially, if the ""voice"" is making pithy surprising statements.
Sometimes it can go too far and become and irritating mannerism.

J.B. isn't short on distinctive generalizations -- starting in the
first paragraph with ""Being master of one's moods is the privilege of
the larger animals,"" and in the second ""Anyone who has considerably
meditated on man, by profession or vocation, is led to feel nostalgia
for the primates,"" they come fast, by page 6 ""an addiction to silk
underwear does not necessarily imply that one’s feet are dirty,"" and
""A single sentence will suffice for modern man: he fornicated and read
the papers.""

What are some you notice or think are meaningful?

One I like came on pg 77: ""Aristocracy cannot imagine itself without a
little distance surrounding itself and its life.""

One related observation he makes about his life before the fall is
that ""Indeed, wasn’t that Eden, *cher monsieur:* no intermediary between
life and me?""  The idea of living spontaneously being Eden is
intuitive, I think -- self-doubt, self-consciousness are familiar
discomforts (and comforts) for most people who read books like this.
But it's interesting that he imagines a class of people trained up
to look at thier life as separate from themselves, a separation he
can never make."
bookclub,"Things are slowly but surely coming together, but I feel as though the more information I get about Crake, Oryx and Snowman, the more questions I have. 

Chapter 5 is interesting, because we see Snowman continue to interact with the Children of Crake. Crake and Oryx seem to be deities to these people. How do you think Oryx plays into the current world state? 

We also see Snowman use the Children of Crake and come up with false narratives for them, but he seems to see himself as their savior. We see this specifically in the quote:
 &gt;Why don't they glorify Snowman instead? Good, kind Snowman, who deserves glorification more -- much more -- because who got them out, who got them here, who's been watching over them all this time? Well, sort of watching. It sure as hell wasn't Crake. Why can't Snowman revise the mythology? *Thank me, not him! Lick my ego instead?*

While Snowman is the one who is creating this mythology he feels powerless to change it to something beneficial to him. This seems odd since he is literally capable of saying whatever. Do you think it is because Crake is absent and Snowman is not? Is it just easier for humans to glorify what they have not had contact with? 

In chapter 2 Atwood talks about Jimmy; in chapter 4 Atwood talks about Crake; in chapter 6 Atwood discusses Oryx. 

What do you think of Oryx? 
What do you think of how she speaks to Jimmy? She keeps herself hidden, and yet is also very open. She seems coy and acts as though she knows more than Jimmy. She speaks about Jimmy to Crake like parents would speak about a child. 

Oryx specifically says about Jimmy that her and Crake think he does not have ""an elegant mind."" What do you think she means by *elegant* mind? 

What do you think about her life growing up? What does it say about the state of the world? What do you think about her view of it? Despite her childhood she still hangs onto the notion that the world is beautiful. 

Jimmy is very bothered by Oryx's past, but mostly because of how she reacts to telling it. He asks himself ""Where was her rage, how far down was it buried, what did he have to do to dig it up?"" "
bookclub,"**Voting is closed; Revolutionary Road is the selection; announcement forthcoming**

For June, we'll select a single book in any category.  Short, long, obscure, mainstream, rarefied literature of base commercial pulp -- nominate whatever *you'd* want to discuss.

There is some
discussion of running a series of novellas in the mod mail, and I expect
there will be more on that soon. 

Selected book will be announced Tuesday, May 23.


**Rules**

**Nominate as many books as you like** but keep each one *in a its own comment.* Please take a moment to check out our previous selections. It's okay to nominate something we've read before but you might want to see if we've selected it recently before you nominate. Or maybe you'd like to nominate something that narrowly lost out in recent months.

Again, **PLEASE NOMINATE ONLY ONE TITLE PER COMMENT** so we can vote for specific titles.

Vote for any book you'd like to see selected and upvote as many as you'd like. Don't bother downvoting -- in contest mode, only upvotes count and comments are sorted randomly.

[Book]\(http://www.wikipedia.com/Book)
By [Author]\(http://www.wikipedia.com/Author) 

\&gt; Book description goes here. This book is really awesome because I said so, etc. Here are some blurbs from reviewers..."
bookclub,"The final chapter - the sixth - is a pleasure  for a reader like me, as
it introduces more plot (the episode of being the pope comes up right away)
and the blank spot above  the bar  that came up at the beginning is explained.

I thought the blank  spot  above  the bar  was probably a deliberate 
reference to the Checkhov precept about a gun over the mantel in the first
act  has  to go off:  J.B. referred to it  so noisily, I thought
Camus was getting us to focus on it.  I  had expected  it was a joking
kind of  thing and he was never  going to explain,  but we'd have to
find meaning in the blank.

Also right at the front of part 6 is a question/hypothesis/assertion
relevant to any story:

&gt; Don't lies eventually lead to the truth? And don't all my stories,
true or false, tend toward the same conclusion? Don't they all have
the same meaning? So what does it matter whether they are true or
false if, in both cases, they are significant of what I have been and
of what I am?

I think the implication here is that thinking about stories leads to
generalization, thought experiment, introspection, examination.  If
you take it extremely, it means that with regard to their outcome, a
casual anecdote is the same as War and Peace or a monograph about
dining rituals of savages in the antipodes; and J.B.  is taking a
utilitarian/mechanical view of stories: all that matters is what
change they effect in the hearer/reader.

Others have talked about The Fall as being a machine to set off a
process in the reader's conscious, rational mind, an intellectual
operator.  I found this at Google Books, by Svenja Schrahe from the *Journal of the Albert
Camus Society* (if you're not familiar with it, you don't know *JACS*):


&gt;The method used by Camus as described in The Fall resembles not only
the projection but also an echo. The reader is inside the head of the
character or author. According to the explained projection theory the
reception and expectation would make him understand and become more
involved with the text. Consequently, the echo is a part of the result
when the projection theory worked its whole way down the staircase. It
is one of the main keys that are needed to unlock the meaning. Besides
several approaches to text that question whether to divide the author
from his text or not, the echo stands outside this question as it is
truly more philosophic in its approach. The echo unlocks the intended
meaning. First of all because it displays the whole process of writing
done by the philosopher or author and puts them inside the head of the
reader. However, at the same time it unlocks the unintended meaning,
where the reader is encouraged to think about what is read.  Thinking
is an issue that leads back to the very nature and so to say fuel of
philosophy. The chain reaction is that a questioning follows of what
was read and questioning requires understanding, so in the end the
circle is closed.  Three items interchange generally in this circle,
the text, the author and the reader. All of them can appear in all
their possible mathematical hierarchies yet the result is that their
engagement leads back to *question-understanding-
projection-echo-question...* and so forth.


That's captures a major thing about the book: it feels like it's  meant to teach, to effect
a change in how we thing about the world, at a conscious level.  Plenty of
novels are didactic, and I think it's reasonable to argue any kind of
narrative reflects a imposition of outlook and taste on the reader.

What to make of the statement that in Africa all parties seemed
equally right -- is it a comment on history, or a general observation
that on the front, all parties are wrong (since both maintain the
other is in the wrong and they are equally right, it follow they are
both wrong, whether they are both correct or both incorrect).

The end was  a gimmick ending that took me off guard and I enjoyed:
that the kind of lawyering that doesn't need a diploma is what we've
just sampled.  It seems to me like it is tantamount to asking the
reader to put himself thru the same process J.B. has undergone, that
the device draws attention to the narrator's relation to the visiting
lawyer being similar to Camus's relationship to the reader."
bookclub,"We had an amazing discussion of chapters 1 and 2 and so I'm really excited to look even deeper into this book with the addition of chapters 3 and 4. These chapters were kind of an extension of 1 and 2 in a lot of ways. In 3 we get a vision of the world as it is. Jimmy is discussing what life is like and is simply trying to survive. He seems to be looking for some kind of purpose. He knows he should try to work hard towards survival, but keeps looking for more: 
&gt;He could make lists. It could give his life some structure (p. 41 in my version). 

However, we also get some weird sections in chapter 3 that seem to be referring to past memories.

&gt;She smiles up at him and moves her arms gently to keep afloat, and he knows they are both in great danger. Then there's a hollow booming sound, like the door of a great vault shutting. 

This memory of Oryx makes the reader wonder--what danger? 

In Chapter 4 we move back to the world as it *was* and learn a lot about Crake, Oryx and Jimmy. 

Some questions to get us started: 

Why do you think Jimmy's mom left? Clearly she thought something was ethically wrong with the genetic projects. Was she right to leave? Do you think NooSkins and OrganInc take it too far? Or do you think that she reacted too strongly? 

Other than the fallout between Jimmy's mother and father, Jimmy is going through some pretty typical teenage growth it seems. He feels misunderstood, annoyed by parental figures, feels lonely, feels emotional, interested in girls, interested in the opinions of others. But during all of this Jimmy meet Crake (or Glenn) who is a tad unusual. One passage I really liked was where Jimmy explains why Crake is always Crake to him, and not Crake/Glenn or anything else. This seems interesting that Jimmy thinks of any memory of Crake as distinctly Crake and that Crake was always there. This means Snowman has merged Crake and Glenn together. This is particularly interesting, because Snowman has made such a clear distinction and has tried to separate Snowman and Jimmy, this could be seen in talking about Jimmy in the 3rd person and commenting on his memories in a distant manner. Why do you think Jimmy distinguishes Jimmy/Snowman, but not Crake/Glenn? 

What do you think Crake's hobbies say about him? He's interested in games like Chess, and Extinctathon, Blood and Roses, executions, and child pornography. Do you think Jimmy would have explored these things regardless? Or do you think Jimmy was profoundly influenced by Crake? 

What do you think about Oryx? She's still mysterious, but already intriguing. As Snowman has pointed out, she doesn't react like most women. Even as a child, she behaved in an unusual way. 

What do you think about the progress of technology, particularly as viewed through the lens of the promotions Jimmy's father receives. Do you think technology actually advances in such a way? The OrganInc project seemed pretty medical and health related, but NooSkins seems purely aesthetic and while it could be a big help for some people who do need those kind of skin repairs, it seems kind of like a more advanced plastic surgery. I guess what I'm asking is: Do you think technological progress begins as a genuine, good-intentioned project and then progresses into aesthetics and superfluous advances for human enjoyment? 

Beyond this, there is of course a lot to talk about! Let's keep up the good discussion. "
bookclub,"This will be not much more than marginalia and stock-taking, I'm
still looking for a hold on the novella, a productive way to talk
about it.  Most novels are full of incident, motivation, characters
that give them familiar structure, variety within recognizable
outlines.  This one eludes me.  What do you see as coherent elements in the book that make a story of M. Clamence's insights and diagnoses?

A trip to the Zuider See, not for the usual tourist sights, but to see
grey dunes where there are no people.  Jean-Baptiste is going into
prophet/teacher mode: he starts part 4 with ""I am one of the few
people who can tell you here"" and ends part 5 saying he's Elijah
without a messiah.

What is significant about the absence of people at Zuider See, was
it once a Jewish district?

J-B is also judge-penitent and brings up the idea of the little-ease,
a philosophical stance where there is no rest, and life is reduced
to restriction and exhaustion.  It's, strictly speaking, a voluntary
punishment he submits to, but he also gives the impression it's part
of a logical process: he's caught in a morality machine that sentences
him to the little-ease.

The guilt, discomfort, dishonesty and delimmas he's talking about
are *time specific*, both personally and culturally.  For him, he
stared in a Eden of unmediated engagement with life.  And our current
culture is also changed  from the past: he makes a point of saying
it's the modern era that's so quick to judge.

The doves that hover above Amsterdam, never alighting, is a
poetic conceit, a run of tangible imagination, a bringing-into-being
by Jean-Baptiste.

Back in ch 2 or 3 he says he has a sideline in lawyering ""in these
neighborhoods where diplomas aren't required"" (paraphrase).  Is he
talking about actual employment or that he tries and judges people
in his personal court?

Why the rain all the time in Ch 1-3?

bookclub,Theres a girl's night/ book club in SF May 22nd. The book is Big Little Lies. Anyone in the area?

Again, I hope that the mods are ok with this and if not I will understand the post being removed or locked."
bookclub,"First discussion for Oryx and Crake!

I, personally, am already hooked and these chapters felt too short! 

Brief biographical background of Margaret Atwood: 
Canadian author (still alive! 77 years old). Most of her works of fiction are set in the future and are typically commentaries on society, government, corporations, gender, and human nature. While she addresses really heavy and often dreary topics, her books are delightfully engaging and enjoyable to read, because of her vivid stories and terse writing style. Fun fact: She's also an inventor!

These first two chapters address what the world *is* and what the world *was*. While these chapters and vague and only offer a very brief glance into the world and the character(s) there's already a lot she's throwing at us that's worth discussing! So here are a few questions to get us started or to prompt thinking. 

So we almost immediately are introduced to the characters who are found on the title of the book, and while it's clear they're significant, we know little about them. 
Any thoughts/predictions about who Crake is? How do you think he came to have so much power and control? 
What about Oryx? Who do you think she was? Do you think she's dead? Gone? 

What do you think about Snowman/Jimmy? How did Jimmy's life as a youngster shape who he is now as Snowman? What do you think about how Jimmy related to the Pigoons and how he relates to the children?

Why do you think Snowman refuses to explain what the items are or what his beard is to the children? As a child Jimmy always longed for his mother to try hard to help him understand, but he does not try to help the children understand--why is this? 

What is Atwood saying about gender relations in the following quote:
&gt;Women, and what went on under their collars. Hotness and coldness, coming and going in the strange musky flowery variable-weather country inside their clothes -- mysterious, important, uncontrollable. That was his father's take on things. But men's body temperatures were never dealt with; they were never even mentioned, not when he was little except when his dad said, ""Chill out."" Why weren't they? Why nothing about the hot collars of men? Those smooth, sharp-edged collars with their dark, sulphurous, bristling undersides. He could have used a few theories on that.  

When looking back on the world when Jimmy was young, how is it like and how is it different from the world we live in now?

Snowman says to himself:
&gt;Snowman, Snowman. Get a life.

What do you think this quote means?

One of the first things Atwood mentions about Snowman is that he has a watch that is his ""talisman"". Why do you think this is his talisman? And what do you think it means for the world to be at the ""zero hour""?  



Please feel free to go beyond these questions! There's a lot here. Sorry for all the questions, but Atwood put a lot into these two brief chapters."
bookclub,"Some people will be most interested in talking about philosophical
and ethical issues the book deals with.  I'm most interested in how
it works as a novel(la).  I'd like to use this first read thru to
develop questions of about any aspect of the book -- it's short
enought to read twice or more during May, so I'm figuring we'll
come back thru after reading the whole thing and try to get answers
or observations about the questions.

Below are some starters questions.  

In the comments, propose further questions, or tentative answers to
these, or other questions.  Or talk about any aspect of the book.  And
as always, it's fine to start up new threads about the Fall, on any
topic you like.  Our schedules are just suggestions, meant to evoke
wide-ranging free-wheeling conversation, not constrain it.

What images of falling do you see?  He seems to have fallen professionally,
and there is rain all the time.  The constant references to leaves falling.
Others?

References in beginning to loving the primates and comparing men 
to animals -- the European idea of the Great Chain of Being, with
man at the top -- is there any discussion of falling from that?

Why the reference to our Hitlerian ""brethren"" when talking about how the
Jewish quarters have been cleaned up of drills?

Do you question at all whether Jean-Baptiste Clamence has a real
interlocutor?  Might he be imagining having someone to talk to?  Might
he be a loser hypothesizing about the kinds of problems a charismatic
successful person might have?

Why set in Amsterdam?

What was the picture that used to hang over the bar?



"
bookclub,"This is a short book, but dense, and, having read two chapters it's pretty clear to me it's going to be hard to talk about the significance of the beginning without having read thru the end.  So I'm going to adapt the schedule that way.

There are 6 chapters, 147 pages in Justin O'Brien translation I have; Chapter 3 goes thru page 71.

Saturday May 6 - Notes and Questions, thru Ch 3

Thursday May 11 - Notes and Questions, thru Ch 5  (pg 118)

Saturday May 13 - Notes and questions, whole book

By ""and questions"" I mean we'll try to develop some productive questions to ask as we go, and  we'll schedule other topical discussions to
do later in the month -- for example maybe ""different ways of falling and
the ranking they imply""

I want to stress, as it says in the sidebar, *You don't have to observe
the schedule* -- this isn't a particularly spoiler-prone book in
terms of plot (I expect), and you can post about any aspect of any
part at any time; just make it clear in the subject what part you're
referring to.

bookclub,We made it! Post your thoughts on the book. Several passages in the last section stood out for me but i'm still left with a lot of unresolved thoughts. Raskolnikov's stubborness about the validity of his ideas being one of the biggest mysteries.
bookclub,"From Pevear's criticism, I was expecting Part 2 to be uniformly tedious and reek of pedagogy -- I didn't detect anything like that in reading, it seemed as whimsical and multivocal as part I.

Chichikov meets: in Ch 1, a young man, Tyentyetnikov,  beset by lassitude; in Ch 2, a general whose daughter, Ulinka, was briefly Tyentketnikov's love interest; In ch 3, a man who's mortgaged everything, Pyotr Petrovitch Pyetuh, and his nephew, Platanov, who will become, it seems, a travelling companion, and Platanov's brother in law, Konstantin, a disciplined, rich landowner, who promises to teach Chichikov to be rich.

Compared to Book 1, it's a quick developing plot.  But it's beginning to show places where the translators note words are illegible and pages missing in the manuscript, so we'll never get the pleasure of see  the great vista Gogol announced he'd planned for his narrative to open into.

I continued to notice his love for expressions, as when Pyotr is urging them to eat more, comparing shoving more food into a packed gut to people making room for the mayor at an overfull church.

Konstantin the estate owner who turns all dross into gold I also thought was interesting -- and it's just that ""perfect landowner"" that Peavey seemed to object to.

I thought it was only in Part II that there's actually an explanation of why Ch. wants the souls -- to mortgage them once they're resettled -- was that explained in Part I, and I missed it?

What passages stand out to you, and do you see any structure or intent in these chapters.


We'll have thru-end-of book post next week, and then one more on Criticism -- till then, post any thoughts here, in standalone posts, or in [the marginalia](https://redd.it/62kk72) thread."

# Unlorded

*by Ernest Hilbert*

Appeared in [Fruit Pulp](http://www.fruitapulp.com/2014/06/30/four-poems-by-ernest-hilbert/)
&amp;nbsp;   
&amp;nbsp;   
Behind us all an ancient king gone blind,  
Who gropes at books, beside a queen who’s lost  
Her once worshiped beauties, her taunting songs,  
And all her appetites, save that for sleep.  
Conceits as well have dimmed, lost hawk and hind,  
And what was spent is only felt as cost.  
They find they hear no more the wind that long  
Ago propelled their fields to drought, put sheep  
Into the earth, when rainfall loosened soil,  
And, if they still recall our names and days  
We took the games and shook the eaves with roars,  
And laughed until we were emptied of breath,  
They know we carried with us hurt and toil,  
And voyaged far to get where flocks could graze,  
Found humor, even happiness, in wars,  
And kindness, as well, and life, in kind, in death.  

"
bookclub,"""Never in his life had he felt so dreadfully alone!"" V.5

As we approach the end of the book Raskolnikov is really going through a lot of wretched anxiety, loneliness, and despair. What are your thoughts on this section?"
bookclub,"Pevear quotes I. F. Annensky praising Gogol's ""plunging into"" the ""bottomless physicality"" of the world; Annensky talks about uniting a dusty box of nails with the glow in the Eastern sky.  Do you see places in Dead Souls where the physicality of mundane things is somehow significant?

A Pevear comment that intrigues me is ""His is in fact an inverted realism: the word creates the world in Dead Souls.""  Does he mean anything more than that Gogol indulges love of speech?  Pevear uses the example of the how pleased Chichichkov is by the apt vulgar nickname at the end of chapter 5.  I think of a couple passages.

One  in chapter 11

&gt; And that was how this strange subject [his scheme for buying souls] formed itself in our hero's head, for which I do not know whether readers will be grateful to him, but how grateful the author is, it is even difficult to express. For, say what you will, if this thought had not entered Chichikov's head, the present poem would never have come into being.

and in Chapter 5, having escaped Nozdryov

&gt; ""Say what you like,"" he said to himself, ""if the police captain hadn't shown up, I might not have been granted another look at God's world! I'd have vanished like a bubble on water, without a trace, leaving no posterity, providing my future children with neither fortune nor an honest name!"" Our hero was very much concerned with his posterity.

Both of these passages might seem like frivolous gimmicks of logic but I think they're interesting in how words create the true world we inhabit and separate it from the tangible world.  The first is about the existence of the narrative itself -- how there could be a world where this entire novel doesn't exist, if it weren't for something that happens in the novel. And the second is Ch. fretting abandoning the children he wouldn't have if Nozdryov had killed him.

If you forebear scoffing at these conceits -- it expresses a vision of reality being  contingent on its own *story* -- that words bring things into life and the possibility of their not having come to life can be mourned.  Correspondingly though, indulging language and creating those worlds can be celebrated. -- There is an infinite amount to mourn, so many stories untold -- and no limit to how much we can create the stories that by extreme luck *do* come into existence -- that's the path those thoughts lead me along.

I haven't read the Nabokov essay yet, I but I hope you all have and have comments to make in the thread, how you apply his thoughts to Dead Souls.  Also, suggest any other writing you can find about Dead Souls, or *general* writing about literature you'd like to try to apply to Dead Souls."

bookclub,"Part I ends with a surprise: we suddenly get a backstory, where before Chichikov had been just an eccentric.  We also get a lecture, about how we should look inward and discover Chichikov in ourselves, and not feel superior to him.

Some sample questions:

The first few chapters were disconnected episodes that introduced various characters.  Suddenly on return to town, the book turns ""plotty"" -- characters return to mess up his plans, he falls in love.  Did you find the transition from the seemingly aimless style to a more conventional style let Gogol do anything interesting, or did it make the plot part more interesting?

Is the narration of how he got to the provincial town of N---, Gogol gives a whirlwind biography of a not entirely pleasant hero, one that he presents himself as being unfortunately saddled with (start of Chapter 11).  What is the point of moving all the backstory to the very end of part I, and announcing this disparaging view of Chichikov?"
bookclub,"This is a whole book thread, but if your post has spoilers, indicate what chapters its assuming familiarity with.

----

Sorry this post is a day late; and I'll get the post for discussion
thru end of part I late tonight.

What can we say about the style of Dead Souls?  By ""style"" I mean a
very broad range of attributes, basically everything that makes up the
""flavor"" of the book.  If you read 2-3  sentences, you know
you're not reading Hemingway or Zadie Smith; a paragraph and you
can rule out Dostoevsky or Henry James -- what makes this book different
than other books?

Googling ""literary style"", I hit this potpourri of components, but
the last sentence is especially interesting:

&gt;[""Style"" includes all of] point of view,
symbolism, tone, imagery, diction, voice, syntax, and the method of
narration. Style is a fundamental aspect of fiction, as it is
naturally part of every work of prose written. Some types of writing
are required to have a certain style, such as academic or journalistic
writing.

All novelists have a *choice* of styles, limited only by their 
competence and sometimes what their publishers will buy -- how can we
characterize what Gogol chooses to do?

What are examples?

As always, answers don't have to be subtle or reflect great conviction
or profound insight -- proceed with recapitulation of the obvious,
hypotheses, and small steps forward.  And consult/contribute to
[marginalia](https://redd.it/62kk72) in forming answers.
"
bookclub,"What are your thoughts on this section?

I was drawn to Raskolnikov's sudden insight about the nature of society while talking to Sonya:

""And now I know, Sonya, that he who is tough in mind and spirit will be their master! For them, he who dares is right. He who cares least is their lawmaker, and he who dares most is most right! It's always been the way and always will be! Only a blind man would fail to see it!""

Raskolnikov appears to be distancing himself from people like ""them""."
bookclub,"This post covers thru Ch 8


**Summary:** Chichikov travels to buy souls at three places in ch
4, 5 and 6 -- Nozdrev in 4 is argumentative, won't sell without
knowing what Chichikov wants dead tenants for.  The chapter ends
with him Nozdrev arrested.  Ch. 5 - He gets entangled with another
another carriage and sees a hauntingly beautiful girl he can't
manage to talk to.  He gets to Sobakevitch and gets many industrious
dead souls with detailed biographies.  Ch 6 he finds the miserable
miserly Plushkin and buys from him.  In Ch 7 he comes to town, signs
the deals at the magistrates office, and has a feast at the police
chief's house.  Chapter 8 . . . ~~I fell behind and haven't read it
yet.~~ Chichikov, now a local favorite and presumed a millionaire,
 attends a ball where the beautiful girl is, he is infatuated.   And Nozdrev
shows up and starts yelling about Chichikov buying dead souls, flustering
Chichikov.  He bores the girl, incurs the scorn of all the women at the 
ball, and leaves early to return to his room.

-----


Until Chapter 7, it feels very unplotted: no character recurs, the
only little connection between them is Sobakevitch's bad-mouthing
of other characters Chichikov met in town.  This looseness of connection
means that the showy digressions don't interrupt anything.  I've discovered
in writing this that one of the primary ones I had in mind is not present
in the Gutenberg edition -- at the beginning of chapter 6, in P&amp;V, there
are two long paragraphs about the way enchantment fades from the world
as we age, completely absent from Gutenberg -- [this search will 
show you them](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22flashed-by+never-to-return+childhood%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8).


Otherwise, one thing I thought was remarkable was the portrait of
Plushkin reminded me Dickens sentimental writing.  I think it's
effectively admonitory, not merely sentimental, the image of his
gradual wandering into monstrous misanthropy when he loses his wife
and drives away his children. The pathetic passage where he remembers
times that he shared company with the magristrate -- ""Over Plushin's
wooden features there had gleamed a ray of warmth -- a ray which
expressed, if not feelingk, at all event feeling's pale reflection.""
-- that passage is brief but effective.

What are you all finding interesting in these chapters as far as 
narrative technique, mood, humor, ideas?"

Summary:  We meet Chichikov.  He ingratiates himself with the town people.
He goes to balls, his business is unclear.

Ch 2: He visits Manilovka who is delighted to have a friend; and Chichikov
buys dead souls

Ch 3: He gets lost looking for another acquaintance (because Selifan
is drunk and absorbed talking to horses) and stumbles into Nastasia's
estate; after some arguments -- she really wants to sell agricultural
projects -- he buys dead souls from her also.

-----

What is the point of the ZAmanilovka/Manilovka confusion in part 2?

When he leaves town in beginning of Ch 2, there is a lot abouthow typical
the landscape is.  I take this as emphasizing that the scene is cliche.
The P&amp;V translation is more emphatic, with ""scrawling itself"" -- that
seems to me to call attention that the written account is a heap of
familiar issues.

How would you relate the decision to portray landscape that way to the
description of Chichikov as not this/not that?  How would you relate it
to the theme of Russianness?


P&amp;V

&gt; after a few more good hard bumps of his head against the sides,
Chichikov was at last racing over soft ground.  No sooner had the town
dropppedd back than all sorts of stuff and nonsense, as is usual with
us, began scrawling itself along both sides of the road: tussocks, fir
trees, low skimpy stands of young pines, charred trunks of old ones,
wild heather, and similar gibberish. Strung-out villages happened by,
their architecture resembling old stacks of firewood, covered with
gray roofs with cutout wooden decorations under them, looking like
embroidered towels hanging down.  Several muzhiks yawned, as is their
custom, sitting on benches before the gates in their sheepskin
coats. Women with fat faces and tightly bound bosoms looked out of
upper windows; out of the lower ones a calf peeked or a sow stuck her
blind snout. Familiar sights, in short.

Hogarth

&gt; And, sure enough, after his head had been bumped a few more times
against the boot of the conveyance, Chichikov found himself bowling
over softer ground. On the town receding into the distance, the sides
of the road began to be varied with the usual hillocks, fir trees,
clumps of young pine, trees with old, scarred trunks, bushes of wild
juniper, and so forth.  Presently there came into view also strings of
country villas which, with their carved supports and grey roofs (the
latter looking like pendent, embroidered tablecloths), resembled,
rather, bundles of old faggots. Likewise the customary peasants,
dressed in sheepskin jackets, could be seen yawning on benches before
their huts, while their womenfolk, fat of feature and swathed of
bosom, gazed out of upper windows, and the windows below displayed,
here a peering calf, and there the unsightly jaws of a pig. In short,
the view was one of the familiar type.

Later, at the estate, I liked  P&amp;V's ""boring""

&gt; The scene was enlivened by two peasant women who, picturesquely
gathering their skirts and tucking them up on all sides, waded
knee-deep into the pond with two wooden poles, pulling a torn dragnet
in which could be seen two entangled crayfish and the gleam of a
caught shiner; the women seemed to be engaged in a quarrel and were
exchanging abuse over something. Off to one side darkled a pine forest
of some boring bluish color. Even the weather itself was most
appropriately serviceable: the day was neither bright nor gloomy, but
of some light gray color such as occurs only on the old uniforms of
garrison soldiers—a peaceful enough army at that, though somewhat
unsober on Sundays."

Candlepin, lynchpin, safety pin become  
death by fire, hanging, stabbing. Cocktail  
becomes the plumage of a male bird  
staring me down in the dirt. Napkin    
is a sleeping cousin drooling on my bed:  
it’s noon. Heaven-sent, you smell like  
the gods. A word can sock you with a kick,  
mock you in a turtleneck, hiding its intent.  
Barely. Comedy is two-faced, watching.  
Come on, give it a try. Hot dog? Wild  
flower? Everything is sweaty and dancing  
when you bring back the inanimate.  
Looking into its violent core, dormant  
but burning to be read wrong, read right.

bookclub,"What did everyone think? I highlighted a lot in this section and will just post one short quote of Porfiry Petrovich below.

bookclub,"Hello, everyone. I'm asking anyone who has read this book and has any commentary to speak up now. What did you think?

There are no wrong comments. :-)"
bookclub,"Let's have a round of praise-songs for everyone whose been leading discussions lately.  March turned out to be an awful month for me as far as having time to post anything, and bookclub stayed humming.  Also I should mention  /u/duke_paul, who was the first volunteer after I started modding.  

And from before I got here, I should mention /u/ezrabooth121 who revived the Infinite Jest big-read and finished the schedule.

Having routine scheduled posts is a big change for bookclub, and all these ""pioneering"" read runners are helping to institutionalize the practice.

Thank these mighty readers and keyboardists: write poems in their praise, tell you children of their deeds,  &amp; shower them with upvotes and gildings.

bookclub,"Wow! We made it! What an incredible book.

What did you think of the ending? Does it make sense that everyone regained their sight? Why do you think Saramago had them regain their sight? 

Why do you think the wife never lost hers?

What do you think Saramago is saying about ignorance, morality, and spirituality throughout the whole book? There was a particularly interesting passage during the last chapter where all the paintings and figures in the church are covered with white paint or white blindfolds. What do you think was the significance of this passage?

Any other thoughts, comments, favorite quotes, specific details you noticed?"

I expect many of us have already finished the book as it is very exciting at this bit. If you have, please leave a comment saying so. If everyone is done, we may benefit from an early end date.

bookclub,"I've only checked at amazon, often google play has same discounts, and I don't know about other ebook vendors -- anyway, another book by this guy, ""How to read literature like a professor"" is often praised in r/books; I read it and think it has strong points.  This particular book gets accused of being largely a rehash.  Might be good, I bought it, Amazon allows returns for a few days if it's junk.

Anyway, go to your favorite vendor, search for ""How to Read Novels Like a Professor""  by Thomas C. Foster, if you're interested.

bookclub,"In these chapters the inevitable finally happens--everyone is blind. With everyone blind there is no longer any electricity or food being delivered. Quickly those quarantined overthrow their oppressors and then leave the asylum. In the city the doctor's wife looks for food, shelter, and clothing for her group. They start to try and find their old homes. First they visit the home of girl with the dark glasses, next they go to the doctor's house which has managed to not be ransacked and is nearly pristine, finally a small group goes to the first blind man's house and meet the writer. 

First, what do you think is different about the city opposed to the asylum? 

In these chapters we see that many of the characters have little to no hope that humanity can survive for long. Do you think this is the end of humanity? Is all hope lost? Or can they rebuild and overcome blindness? 

We meet two major characters outside of the group in these chapters--the writer and the old woman. What do you think the significance of these characters are?

These chapters also discuss the topic of family. The blind girl and the boy with the squint are still holding onto their memories of family. The doctor and his wife and the first blind man and his wife still have each other. The man with the eye patch had no one to begin with. What do you think family means during this pandemic of blindness? "

bookclub,"**This has quotes which could be spoilers thru IV.2 - Fair Warning**

C&amp;P refers to Gogol directly several times in the text and reading this sentence I wondered if it was a distant allusion to Dead Souls as well:

""And that's why they have such a dislike of life as a living process: a living soul is the last thing they want! Living souls demand life; living souls don't obey mechanics, living souls are suspicious; living souls are reactionary!""

The connection between madness and belief in ghosts seems to link C&amp;P to Hamlet, at least for me:

""By the way, do you believe in ghosts?""

""What ghosts?""

""Ordinary ghosts, what else?""

and

""I agree that only the sick see ghosts, but this merely proves that you have to be sick to see ghosts, not that they don't exist in themselves."" - IV.1

I also continue to be fascinated by Raskolnikov's borderline delusions, ""Because, you know...the thought occurred to me...and I still can't help feeling...that this might be a fantasy.""

and 

""Well just now I had the impression that perhaps I really am insane and what I saw was only a phantom!"" - IV.2"

Below is *The Pig Roast*. 

Read it a few times, dwell on it, mutter it, then post observations, associations, digressions and analysis. Start at the very most basics: it's not important to be thorough or have a firm opinion about anything -- in fact, you shouldn't at first, we're looking at the process of how understanding of a poem grows over repeated readings, so just spout off what you notice about the poem that might contribute to its effect. Obvious or subtle, with certainty or any degree of tentativeness . . . . let's beat the swine out of *The Pig Roast*.

----------

**The Pig Roast**

By Joshua Mehigan

From *The Poem Tree* [website](http://www.poemtree.com/poems/PigRoast.htm)



The afternoon wound down.  The pool was calm.

Some children played around the emptied trough.

The small low town was far enough away

Behind the trees to look as though it were

A thread of road, some boxes, a toy steeple,

Propped on a branch.  The parents bustled in

To cocktails when the lightning bugs began.

The children had the country on their shoes.

Outside, they watched the greasy farmhand set

A tractor's broken axle in the half-light.

They trailed him with a hundred aimless questions

Until an aunt corralled them in the house.

A wobbly mother volunteered to fight

The crusted shoes and knotted laces off.

Outside, the farmhand closed his day.  He crouched

Beside the rifle hanging from the fence

And scratched the pig's broad head, then slowly rose

As though he'd left a tea cup balanced there.

After the shot, the farmhand turned to spit,

And, with a rag, wiped from his dirty hands

What must have been the day, being done with it,

And turned then to the night, and night's demands.

bookclub,"I'm so terribly sorry for missing my post on the 21st. I had a personal matter come up and I was unable to get to a computer for the last few days. Instead of adjusting the schedule I'm just going to combine the missed post and the upcoming post into one discussion. The rest of the schedule will remain the same. 

So, in other words, I will post discussion questions on Chapters 12-15 on March 26th.

bookclub,"General:

Very close voting -- **White Teeth** and **Lincoln in the Bardo** tied
at 13, there were three books with 12 - Mother Night, True Grit, Pale
Fire.  All five seem like books we should read some day.  I selected
White Teeth because Lincoln is almost bound to be selected someday,
and White Teeth has come in close before.  Another differentiator: we
have a standing volunteer to lead White Teeth discussion,
u/internetrollingtree. Finally I think White Teeth will be easier to
get for people who want to get library/used copies -- where I live,
there is a few month waiting list for Lincoln.


Gutenberg: **Dead Souls** got 12 votes; **Three Men in a Boat** got 8,
that should get nominated again next month.  Both are books I've been
meaning to read for a long time.

bookclub,"How fitting to be coming to a close on this great work of Irish Fiction just following St Patrick's  day. 

We've made it to then end of Stephen's journey (for now). He has broken free from adolescent and the faith he no longer believes. He has ""spread his wings"" (Like Icarus) in ways of thought. However, he hasn't reached peak 'enlightenment', and possible far less than what he thinks he has. When walking through town (brings to mind the labyrinth) and begins to see language and art in everything! He has chosen to leave the Catholic faith behind after two deeply philosophical discussions with Cranly and the Dean. While, many of his thoughts are way above the dean--Cranly questions Stephen's happiness and inner peace. Stephen has realized he cannot 'fake' faith. He cannot choose to believe to appease his mother. Stephen ultimately decides on solitude instead of the views that he views as oppressive. The chapter closes with journal entries,which I was hoping someone could help analyze. 

So, where would you all like to start unpacking this final chapter?"
bookclub,"I stumbled upon a used collection of Jonathan Franzen essays and found this little snip in a piece he wrote about Dostoevsky's The Gambler. The section quoted below seems to have something to say about C&amp;P as well as last week's thread about economic systems.

""No novelist ever wrestled with materialism more fiercely and intelligently than Dostoyevsky. In 1866, when his short novel The Gambler was first published, the stabilizing old narratives of religion and a divinely ordained social order were undergoing dismantlement by science, technology, and the political aftermath of the Enlightenment: already the way was being paved to the brutal materialism of the Communists (which, in Russia and China and elsewhere, would produce body counts in the tens of millions) and to the morally unchecked pursuit of personal pleasure (which would produce more subtle consumerist corruptions and melancholies in the west). Dostoyevsky's mature novels can be read as campaigns against both kinds of materialism, which he had identified as a threat not only to his vodka-soaked, politically intemperate motherland but to his own well-being. His intemperate youthful idealism, for which he'd done five years of hard time in Siberia, provided the impetus for Crime and Punishment and The Devils..."" - Jonathan Franzen"
bookclub,"These next two chapters were emotionally draining for me so I'm not going to ask too many questions, I'm just curious about what you all have to say about how you feel or things you noticed or things you want to reflect on. 

Just a few questions to get us started:

Things were bad... but these two chapters seemed to cross a big line. What do you think makes this crime by the man with the gun and his flunkies worse than starving women, men, and children? Or is it not worse/not seem worse? 

What were your thoughts about the women bathing the insomniac?

    &gt; Book description goes here. This book is really awesome because
      I said so, etc. Here are some blurbs from reviewers...
"
bookclub,"This is not a scheduled post, just something I wanted to discuss, that did not come up yesterday.

So we learned in Chapter 6 that Armitage is Colonel Willis Corto. His past struck me as something worth discussing. So, was anyone else surprised? Did you expect his history of violence? 

I find myself thinking, even though I don't understand what exactly Screaming Fist was, that it had to have had an influence on who he became after the fact. Being forced to lie, to have cosmetic surgery he did not want, and to save the budget for something that would not benefit him. **This is what I got from it, but I can't say that I got it all. *If I missed something, this is why I am posting!***

The violence he was capable seems to be something that could be easily bred by his experience. He became ""obsessed with the idea of betrayal, to loathe the scientists and technicians he bought out for his employers.""(Ace Books version, page 84)

The layers added in this chapter really bring a new face to Armitage in a way I hadn't expected. I mean, I knew he wasn't doing this from the goodness of his heart, that much is crystal clear. But this seems like foreshadowing to see something negative with him coming up. It seems inevitable he is going to slip back into his evil ways. 

Thoughts?"
bookclub,"So in the next three chapters we see different forms of organization and ""government"" among the blind.

Just a few questions to get us started:

During the Enlightenment philosophers argued frequently over human nature in the state of nature. 
Hobbes argued that in the state of nature there are ""No arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death: and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short"" 
Rousseau argues that man is by nature good; society leads to the immorality of man. Thus, Rousseau argues that the state of nature is ideal and man can enjoy full freedom in the state of nature. 

What do you think about the way the blind were organized prior to the man with the gun and after the man with the gun? 

Which philosopher do you think more accurately describes the state of humanity in the colony? 

What do you think the wife should do to help? Should she reveal that she has sight? Or continue to lead subtly? 

What about the wife keeping the scissors? She justifies keeping them so she can trim her husbands beard, what did you think about that? 

What did you think about the first ward sharing the last thing they saw? What do you think is significant about this event? "

bookclub,"I plan to delete this thread in a few days so so don't post any great comments -- writing about Anna K itself is always on-topic per the [Evergreen Rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/wiki/evergreen)


https://www.amazon.com/Karenina-Oprahs-Penguin-Classics-Deluxe-ebook/dp/B0023EFB1O

This is kind-of on topic because it's a previous selection, it'll probably come up for re-read some day - this is one of the best known translatons nowadays.  For US amazaon, it's only $1.99 now.

"
bookclub,"Hello all - hope you are enjoying the big read! 

Please continue to post your thoughts about the book while avoiding spoilers for those who have not read past our schedule.

I started perusing Joseph Frank's biography of Dostoevsky in parallel with reading Crime and Punishment. In the section on C&amp;P there is something curious and I'm interested to see if other readers agree. Frank suggests that the novel contains its own reader's guide. This is not something that I've noticed so far, but maybe it's something to look for as we progress.

""Built into the narrative of *Crime and Punishment* is thus a view of how it should be read, a hermeneutic of its interpretation, which is an integral part of its antiradical theme and expresses Dostoevsky's oft-expressed belief in the importance of ideas and their power to influence human behavior."" - Joseph Frank, Dostoevsky - The Miraculous Years, 1865-1871

And, just to give a little more context, Frank is talking about the dramatic encounters that take place throughout the novel between Raskolnikov and the other characters in the book."
bookclub,"When you can't measure quality, quanitity's your metric.

I just looked at /r/bookclub/comments and there are 31 comments (one from me is administrative stuff on a removed post) before any say ""1 day ago"" -- on Blindness and Neuro mostly - come on C+P and &amp; Portrait readers!

Anyway, great level of involvement -- I know it's always brisker at the beginning of reads, but a big thanks to all four of our read-runners with active reads, hope it inspires more of you to take on the task in future months."
bookclub,"Participating in Marginalia is a central activity in R/Bookclub. While
some people won't take to marginalia, I encourage everyone to try: you
should bookmark the marginalia threads of books you're participating
in, read them and post to them.  The marginalia threads should have
hundreds of comments *about passages in the book*.  Many marginalia
comments should take less than a minute to type up.

The premise is that sharing basic observations about content and craft
can give rise to insights about meaning and craftsmanship.  Marginalia
is a venue for starting with the real basics, the near-atomic building
blocks.  ""There are no quotation marks"" is good marginalia; or ""p 9 
3rd mention of traffic lights"".  The hope is readers pick up on
some of those observations and post more substantive threads of their
own.  **You don't need to have a point**, it can be just data.


# Social media equivalent of underlining

 Many marginalia comments are
very simple observations.  Being a good reader is about noticing what
writers do.  Marginalia is about sharing what you notice.   Not what it means or
what you think of it, not a conclusion, just an observation.  It's not supposed
to be subtle or insightful, it's about making explicit what is so basic it might
escape notice.

# Most comments should be obviously true and almost self-evident

E.g.,
""Raskolnikov sleeps a lot the first half of part II"" is a typical and
good marginalia.  So is ""When Kathy says 'Even you, Ruth, you didn't dare
boss Christy around.' -- that is characterization of Ruth while ostensibly
being about poetry at Hailsham.""  Really clever insights are nice when
they happen but they are *not* the point.   Marginalia is about making
babies, not having orgasms: it's supposed to be productive sweaty work
you do with and for other people.

#The implied 'why' doesn't have to be answered in marginalia

 Every sentence writers lay down represents a thousand
choice.  The presumption with literature should be that there's a
justification for every noticeable nuance in the writers manner.  So if
we start with ""the chapter ends with a long run of very short
sentences"", or ""at Hailsham they can never be alone"" the point is that
someone else, or you yourself later, might see a significance to that,
and correlate it to something else about style.  But you don't have to articulate an answer to post the observation.

# It's like talking sports

Too much book ""discussion"" is puffery that's meant to establish the commenter is an insightful reader, and it makes some generalizing assertion  -- e.g.  ""Don Delillo effectively
conveys the fear of dying and how we attempt to escape from this state
of mind."" -- Marginalia's a tonic and corrective for too much vague
assertions: we're looking for *how* the book works in specific passages.


# Use a Throwaway FTW

 If your marginalia feel too lame to associate
with your usual account, create a new ""throwaway"" one.  Throwaway was
the name of a longshot winner in Ulysses; every comment in marginalia
starts as a dark horse but there are always winners.

# Try to be shallow

In the sense of not running the threads deep with
back-and-forth. A weakness of reddit UI is that it presents
conversational threads poorly, and only the immediate participants get
decent notification; there's not much chance for brainstorming if few
people see your comments.  If a conversation develops, the observation
engendering it likely deserves to be in a thread of its own, or just by
commenting adding a new comment at the top level.


#Sharp new threads

 When you *do* have a more important, longer insight,
start a whole new thread for it.  I want bookclub to develop to a point where
the scheduled threads don't dominate the conversation, but instead there are many
separate threads about specific facets of the book.  

#Reread the marginalia

Skim back thru the marginalia
now and then to see if anything sparks a response that didn't earlier.

#Keep posting when the schedule is over

 You should notice things in memory,
too -- part of reading happens after you've put down the book.  Reddit
locks threads after 6 months or a year. Til then, keep putting in content.  And
you can start a new marginalia thread for any previously read book any time,
mods will support it by leaderboard/announcement status.


#The singular is marginalis or margo

Wiktionary: From New Latin, from Medieval Latin neuter plural of *marginalis* (“on the periphery”), from Latin *margo* (“border, edge”)

I like ""margo"" but usage will decide

bookclub,"Welcome to the [first of 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/5wsirh/neuromancer_tentative_schedule_input_welcome/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) check-ins for Neuromancer. Today we will be going over the first three chapters. Please, be careful of spoilers if you have read beyond Chapter 3. 

[Here is the link to the marginalia](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/5y8gwo/neuromancer_marginalia/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)"
bookclub,"So in the next three chapters we see the humanity in these people, both the blind and the soldiers, start to unravel. Let's discuss!

Just a few questions to get us started:

What do you think about how the government and the soldiers have been handling the situation? Is the murder justified because of the fear? If not, how should the government/soldiers handle the situation? 

Pretty much every single character is hiding a truth. The boy with the squint, that he relieved himself. The girl with the dark glasses, she fails to mention who she is when faced with others she infected. The doctor's wife, her lack of blindness. the doctor, his wife's vision. When these characters don't have to ""look"" at others and can easily ""hide"" their secrets and embarrassments, they quickly begin to hide behind dishonesty. What is Saramago saying about human nature? Do we, as humans, naturally lie when it is easy for us to do? What encourages us to speak the truth? 

So the car thief is really interesting in these chapters. He stole the first man's car, then he tries to pick a fight, then he starts groping the girl with the dark glasses. This all results in him getting a nasty infection from the wound inflicted on him by the girl. What do you think Saramago is saying about justice when this happens to the car thief? Is it justice? Or is it still unfortunate?

What do you think life would be like in the ward without the doctor's wife? Does she make a huge difference despite being silent about her sight or would it be the same?

What do you think so far?"

The premise of that sub is that when you finish a book, you solicit questions -- I'm hoping it'll bring questions from people who haven't gotten sick of hearing about NLMG (and other reads) in this sub.  I let the mods know I'm planning to do this and they're okay with it.

I'd like to make this a regular thing, that we post there at the end of books, and keep an eye on the thread in this sub.  "
bookclub,"Hey guys! Sorry for being a day late--computer trouble. 

How did you all like this chapter? 
I'm not going to post questions. The comments are trickling off compared to the first 2 chapters, so no pressure this time. :)

A lot goes on in this chapter, a big change in Stephen over the course of the Chapter. Early on in chapter 4, Stephen revisits the religious zealotry he has in the past. He dedicates himself to the Catholic faith 100%, even tries to remove the pleasure than can come from eating. But, the pressure of avoiding sin is killing him! He knows he is just one sin a way from being thrown completely back into 'sinful life'. He is obsessed with controlling every aspect of his day to day life, and torments himself over the things he can't. He begins to consider the idea of priesthood, but quickly completely abandones the idea. The chapter closes at the famous 'beach scene' (side note: I have a super cool poster of this scene 😋) where he encounters an angel of sorts, calling him to create art. 

So what did everyone think? Any themes/symbolism/etc you'd like to point out? "
bookclub,"I usually  am unenthusiastic about first person narratives because
you have to account for why the author came to write the narrative,
and, if the narrator isn't supposed to be a competent novelist,
and if the novel is a competent one (an who's 
enthusiastic about reading novels that aren't?) there's a gap between the
what coule realistically be expected from the character and what you get.

Or else (as in the first part of **The Vegetarian**) you have to
imagine it's not really first person but an unspecified voice
depicting the thoughts -- that you're like a ""rider"" in Neuromancer,
and the artifact of the text is a transcription the character had no
role in producing).

But first person is great for conveying a personality to you seemingly
unmediated, and its strength is to let you the first-person character; a
potenial  of  first-persion here is to let Ishiguro implant Kathy H.'s 
personality directly in our minds.

Who is Kathy and why is she writing?

She's outlived her peers.  She has satisfaction with her time as a carer, and
looks forward to being able to think more after the end of this year.

&gt; I was never the sort of kid who brooded over things for hours on end. I've got
that way a bit these days, but that's the work I do and the long hours of quiet
when I'm driving across these empty fields. I wasn't like, say, Laura, who for
all her clowning around could worry for days, weeks even, about some little
thing someone said to her.

It's interesting that she notes a lot of discrepancies between what
she remembers and what other people remember, and has a rhetoric that implies
open-mindedness, but always thinks she's right.  Toward the end of
the novel, I wonder what to make of this:

&gt; ""It's the bit round the back of the duck pond,"" Tommy said.
&gt;
&gt;""What do you mean?"" I whispered back. 'There's no pond. It's just a bit of
countryside.""
&gt;
&gt;""No, the pond's behind you."" Tommy seemed surprisingly irritated. 'You must
be able to remember. If you're round the back with the pond behind you, and
you're looking over towards the North Playing Field...""

It's peculiar in this regard to think about the Chapter One passages about
the donor from Dover who wanted to have memories of Hailsham for some kind
of vicarious pleasant youth, and she told him about

&gt; our guardians, about how we each had our own collection chests under
our beds, the football, the rounders, the little path that took you
all round the outside of the main house, round all its nooks and
crannies, the duck pond, the food, the view from the Art Room over the
fields on a foggy morning.

Mostly about nouns, and visuals, that can be snapped into a stock
emotional landscape of contentment and safety.  But the story she tells
*us*, I think is mostly about repurcussions, memory, loyalty, and it's delivered
in anecdotes that are bound in time -- each incident is part of some
larger process, which ties to what came before and after to tightly
that to start to tell an incident drags in future and past.

I think that's a lot of what Kathy's about -- seeing incidents as tied
to the future and past, like every memory colors other memories.
"
bookclub,"This is the last scheduled post for the February selection **Never Let
Me Go.** I'm posting quotes from a couple authors talking about the
book, one from Paris Review by Ishiguro himself, another from Margaret
Atwood's review.  I'd like to see what other readers think of these
quotes, and of course any commentary on insights/oversights from the
rest of the linked articles is also encouraged.

The
[marginalia](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/5qecod/never_let_me_go_marginalia_feb_2017_read/)
thread remains open, and new threads about this or any other
previously selected book are always on topic.  If there's anything
that comes to mind in the next few weeks, or next few years, please
start a new thread.  


[PARIS REVIEW](https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5829/kazuo-ishiguro-the-art-of-fiction-no-196-kazuo-ishiguro)

&gt; Do you see the novel, as many critics have, as very dark?

ISHIGURO

&gt; Actually, I always thought of Never Let Me Go as my cheerful novel. In the past, I had written about characters’ failings. They were warnings to myself, or how-not-to-lead-your-life books.

&gt; With Never Let Me Go I felt that for the first time I had given
myself permission to focus on the positive aspects of human
beings. OK, they might be flawed. They might be prone to the usual
human emotions like jealousy and pettiness and so on. But I wanted to
show three people who were essentially decent. When they finally
realize that their time is limited, I wanted them not to be
preoccupied with their status or their material possessions. I wanted
them to care most about each other and setting things right. So for
me, it was saying positive things about human beings against the
rather bleak fact of our mortality.

""I wanted them to care most about each other and setting things right.""

Ishiguro obviously has a priveleged position in saying what the novel is
about.  This statement seems to sum up well Tommy's wanting Kathy not
to stay with him to the very end.

What strikes me as off about it though is Kathy's persistent resentment
toward Ruth.



In [Margaret Atwood's review in Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2005/04/brave_new_world.html)
she mentions the same thing -- caring about each other:

&gt; Kathy H. has nothing to say about the unfairness of her
fate. Indeed, she considers herself lucky to have grown up in a
superior establishment like Hailsham rather than on the standard organ
farm. Like most people, she's interested in personal relationships:
....

Atwood also calls out a weirdness I hadn't consciously registered: the 
desire of the students to be a ""good donor"" and get to the fourth."
bookclub,"Context:
Saramago (1922-2010) is a Portuguese writer who won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1998. He grew up poor and part of a family of farmers in a small village. As a child growing up he spent a lot of time with his grandfather, who was illiterate, but would orally tell stories and from these experiences Saramago developed a love for storytelling. In 1991 the Catholic Church and the Portuguese government condemned his novel *The Gospel According to Jesus Christ* and Saramago fled from Portugal. While exiled in the Canary Islands Saramago wrote *Blindness*. He frequently writes within the magical realism genre and uses his stories to comment on politics, spirituality and morality in allegorical or metaphorical ways. 

Just a few questions to get us started:

1. Saramago explores morality and humanity frequently in his novels. Even in these first parts he is looking at humanity and morality through an interesting lens. It's definitely less black and white than many novels of the past, for example the good Samaritan who ends up stealing a man's car. What do you think Saramago is saying about morality in these early chapters?

2. Saramago makes a few religious references in these early chapters, what do you think is the significance of the religious metaphors? What do you think it says about his views on spirituality?

3. Why do you think Saramago chose the characters that he did to get infected by the blindness first? What is he trying to say with the character choice? 

4. Why do you think Saramago refuses to name his characters despite giving them great depth?

5. Which character was your favorite and why? 

So far I'm really enjoying this book. He's got a very unique style that takes some adjusting to, but makes sense within the context of the story. Let me know what you guys think and if you have any questions or if you noticed anything interesting!"
bookclub,"I'll post this or something similar every few months  for years
to come, so if you see an opportunity to clarify it let me know. And
if you're on the fence, think about it til next time, no rush.

I'm looking for other people to take on some tasks running bookclub.
I want to find people who expect they'll be interested for years to
come. I think bookclub will best be served by a *rotating* mod
team. To avoid burnout, I want months-long commitments to specific
tasks, and mods will rotate between those tasks.

# What kind of chores?

At this point, bookclub doesn't require any moderation of psychodrama
issues like some subs have, and automoderator does well at controlling
spam.  There's no emotionally ""gross"" stuff in modding here.  Knock on
wood hoping it stays that way.

It  is a chore to maintain a structured sub.  And there are *more*
time consuming structuring features I'd like to add--more than I
will do on my own.  I'm looking for people who can commit to completing
certain chores *for a limited time*, e.g. ""I'll keep the calendar for
2 months,"" or ""I'll champion tweet supply for 4 months.""

Some tasks are small -- Assigning flair, juggling announcements.  Some
are big, for example I'd really like to have
(leaderboard)[https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/5nalnj/bookclub_leaderboard_alpha_01/]
be a routine thing.


# The Sub's direction

Part of my vision for the sub is that it be a firehose, not a trickle
-- I want there to be too much content for subscribers to read it all.
But the content should be navigable/discoverable, and reddit's
software doesn't help much with that -- curation requires human
effort.

## Abstract, long term: The Local Canon


I'm committed to having the sub focus on previously selected books, as
well as the current selection, and mostly excluding anything else.
E.g., **The Golden Compass** is on-topic, but **Othello** isn't; it's
never been selected. I'm calling the selected works the ""local canon"".

Over time, I want to see a group of readers emerge who can talk about
cross-book ideas (e.g., different uses of irony, or POV, or the
relation of POV to types of irony) citing specific examples from a
that local canon.

## Concrete, immediate

I want to publicize the sub in other social media and add some
""social"" content with subscribers' insights about reading (an
exception to the ""local canon"" focus).

Some of my ideas are sketched out
at https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/wiki/index#wiki_types_of_posts
and https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/wiki/help_wanted.

Posting suggestions for the sub is always on-topic, feel free to comment
or post about any of these or suggest others.

# Your background

What kind of background's good for a mod?

I want people who share the goals in the sidebar: to make bookclub a
place where we stay on the subject of talking about the details of
literature, focusing on specific passages.  Primarily literature, with
occasional forays into non-literary works.  If you believe there's no
important quality distinction between literature and narrative
generally, most likely you won't be interested in this sub's long-term
success.

Before volunteering, you should know enough about yourself and about
literature to know literature will be important to you for a few years
to come.


# Pay

None, all work and no reward beyond the enjoyment you get from advancing
the goals of the sub.

"
bookclub,"So, we've got a lot to discuss this week. As always, please be careful with spoilers for those who have not read beyond our schedule. Great conversations so far. Feel free to check in with how your read is going. ""Best book ever"" or ""Wouldn't line a hamster cage with this drivel"" - whatever.

I have more thoughts but will elaborate as the week goes on. Right now I'm tracking all the references to oblivion and various altered states of consciousness.

For example, ""Oblivion came over him"" right at the end of this section."
bookclub,"“Curiously enough, one cannot read a book; one can only reread it. A good reader, a major reader, and active and creative reader is a rereader.”   So says Vladimir Nabokov and while I don't considere myself a good or major reader, I find I'm much more active while re-reading.


I'd like everyone still tracking to return your attention to part I, skim thru or read aspirating to major reader status, and see what you see that's different or clearer than the first run thru.  Reread the earlier [marginalia](https://redd.it/5qecod) to see what this group was talking about.

A particular interest to me: beyond the *spring* imagery Hongkie pointed out, what do you see that's **seasonal/cyclical, or about beginnings**?

And what about holding/releasing imagery?  The end of the book is heavy with it.   Besides the pillow dance Kathy does while Madame weeps, do you see other images of **holding/letting go**?

Other themes are about **groups, pairs, and individuals**; privacy, loneliness, solidarity.

At the end Tommy talks about his internal image that he's splashing through a field as he runs, and there are  a number of important scenes around water or where water should be (dry swimming pool) later in the book -- does **watery stuff** figure into Part I?

bookclub,"Hello everyone,

I'll be organizing the discussions for *Blindness* by Jose Saramago.

bookclub,"Hey, guys. 

I am lucky enough to be able to help /u/Earthsophagus by running the Neuromancer read. Here you will find a tentative and loose schedule. I would love to hear from anyone with an opinion regarding this schedule. 

So I'm thinking we will start the read on March 8. Aiming for 1 chapter a day has us finishing on March 31. If you keep up with this schedule, I've scheduled 8 check in points. 

* March 8: Read begins

* March 10: Chapters 1-3 discussion

* March 13: Chapters 4-6 discussion

* March 17: Chapters 7-9 discussion

* March 19: Chapters 10-12 discussion

* March 22: Chapters 13-15 discussion

* March 25: Chapters 16-18 discussion

* March 28: Chapters 19-21 discussion

* March 31: Chapters 22-24 and overview discussion 

Any suggestions are welcome."

bookclub,"Here are a links to a review and a couple articles about the novel.  All of them have full-book spoilers.

Read through them and see if there are points they articulate well, questions they beg, or if they offer you insights about either the artistry or significance of NLMG.  Also I encourage you to search out other reviews and articles, and post on this thread about those.  We'll have a second, similar thread March 6, which will be the last scheduled NLMG post.

I also want to encourage everyone to go back, re-read sections at random, and comment on [the marginalia](https://redd.it/5qecod) thread.  It was a little slight for  this book -- I think that might partly be because Kathy's voice isn't terribly quotable, and because the passages are rhetorically pregnant and take longer to summarize than they do to quote.  Or it might be people are bored of marginalia, but I continue to think it's a practical way to harvest insights from these group reads.

**Gray Lady** [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/17/books/review/never-let-me-go-when-they-were-orphans.html) review contains this sentence:


&gt; He works out intricate ways of showing [Kathy's] naïveté, her liabilities as an interpreter of what she sees, but also her deductive smarts, her sensitivity to pain and her need for affection.



What are examples of some of those ""intricate ways""?

**Practical Model** This [article in the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/mar/18/kazuoishiguro) is an example of the practical, non-academic discussion I aspire to, and want to see emerge from reddit book subs, like this one.  It's clear and makes specific assertions.  It doesn't rush to the point of what the book  means, instead it's an examination of some items in the novel that set it apart from other novels.

There's a sentence in it I disagree with: ""A narrator who has no past beyond herself - no family history - has a special need to recollect.""  That raises the question how Kathy is different than anyone else -- what is the difference between Kathy and Ruth.  But just getting the statement out there raises that interesting question.  Is Ruth more imaginative?  That bit with the horses suggests so, and the way Ruth can transform herself to be what the Cottagers want in a Hailsham student suggests she has different inner resources than Kathy.

**The confines of her diegetic world**  [Quiet Success](http://albeitjournal.com/quiet-success-revolution-in-never-let-me-go/) borrows a terse eloquent characterization of something important in the book: ""nonemphatic revelation"".  It also mentions a number of articles about the work, while arguing that Kathy's narrative is an act of resistance."
bookclub,"Wow! A lot to unpack in this episode. I don't have many starter discussion questions. I just want to see what you all think of this chapter. 

How did you feel about the vivid depictions of hell?
What important symbolism is Joyce trying to convey in Chapter 3 that we might have missed at first glance?
How will this affect his attitude towards faith? 
How will this affect his feelings towards women?
Is the Catholic faith beginning to lose credibility in Stephen's eyes?

We left off in Chapter 2 with Stephen leaving the company of a woman in a not so pleasant side of town. At the start of chapter 3 Stephen is very confused with his feelings towards sexuality and feels very guilty. He's freaking out because he knows that he has sinned and God is going to punish him. Later on he attends a series of very descriptive sermons about hell, Satan, and Satan's pride. Stephen feels that the sermons are directed at him and feels compared to Satan! This brings to mind his feelings as a child being freaked out about going to hell during the night. The chapter closes with Stephen not be able to handle the Catholic guilt any longer and confesses at the first church he can find. 

Sorry for the rushed summary, but I think I hit the major points. 


What did you all think of this Chapter? "
bookclub,"OK we've hit our first target. Use this thread to post thoughts up through section I.5. As always, be careful with spoilers for those who have not read beyond this point."
bookclub,"Anyone see the movie version? If so, what did you think? As a movie on its own, and in comparison to the book?

I had seen it when it came out, but that was before I had read any of Ishiguro's novels, so I'm going to rewatch it. I like most of Alex Garland's books and screenplays (but not without some gripes), so when looking up the details of the movie, I wasn't aware he had written the screenplay. That was a nice surprise. He's most notable for writing the novel *The Beach*, and the screenplays for *28 Days Later*, *Sunshine*, and *Dredd*. He also directed and wrote *Ex Machina*.

Here are the movie details. To help you think about the adaptation, I've also pasted some discussion questions (which are from my Kindle ebook version of *Never Let Me Go*), which unfortunately just seem to be generic questions, applicable to any book-to-movie adaptation. 

**Feel free to write about anything you want.**

Personally, over the years, I've become less concerned with a true reproduction of a book in its conversion to the movie screen (or TV screen) but now prefer the director and screenwriter to get the overall *spirit* of the book, allowing them to reinterpret things using their own artistic vision.  If done well, it allows for a new experience that can be just as powerful, something to complement the book-reading experience, not to replace it.

**Never Let Me Go (2010)**

Director: Mark Romanek

Writers: Kazuo Ishiguro (novel), Alex Garland (screenplay)

Stars: Keira Knightley, Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield

**Discussion Questions**

1. Is the plot unchanged, or has it been simplified or otherwise altered for the film? If it has been changed, in what ways? Which elements of the story have been heightened, and which diminished? Why do you suppose the changes were made, and what is the overall effect of the revision? 
2. Did the book’s author have a role in the screenplay, either as writer or advisor? If yes, is the author’s viewpoint evident and how does it affect the film? If no, is the author’s viewpoint successfully or unsuccessfully conveyed? 
1. Have any characters been cut or added? If the main characters are essentially unaltered, how do the actors playing the main characters interpret their roles? Do the actors bring a different kind of meaning to the role than you had seen when you read the book? Does the physical appearance of the actors seem right for the characters?
1. Different kinds of dialogue work better either on the page or on the screen. Are there any examples where exchanges are more vivid or memorable when read or, conversely, when seen? 
1. How does the film handle challenging moments when characters are thinking but not speaking? Is the film effective in conveying the feelings and thoughts of the characters? 
1. Is the film set in the same location(s) as the book? How do the scenic aspects of the film compare with how you imagined the setting when you read the book? Does the film’s cinematography heighten your understanding of the original? 
1. Does the camera sometimes assume a different point of view from that of the narrator in the book? What can one medium do that the other can’t? 
1. Does the film open new ways of thinking about the book? Or, on the other hand, does the film seem insignificant or trivial, compared with your experience of the book? 
1. How would you have conceived, written, or directed the film differently? 
1. In the case where you’ve seen the film first, the focus of the previous questions can be turned around for a different kind of comparison where you’re comparing how the book stands up to the movie experience. What is your experience of the book after having seen the movie first? Has the book made clearer any aspects of the film? Did the film convey certain things better?"
bookclub,"So there are quite a few editions, publications, and translations of this book out there, which might be difficult if we want to quote stuff.

bookclub,"Miss Emily explains the point of the emphasis on art was to see if the students had souls at all. I believe it could be argued that they, in fact, do not. Or at least not as 'deep' as a real human being.

I came on this notion when the students believed they could somehow prove their love and earn a deferral. In retrospect, it seems like they were doomed from the beginning, even though the reader is rooting for Tommy and Kathy at the end. If the students actually believed they had verifiable evidence that they were truly in love, then maybe they only have a surface level understanding of what love really is. Remember, the students never had fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, grandparents, etc. The people that children first learn to love when growing up. They learned about love through discussion of having safe sex and reading books and watching movies. 

When Ruth tells Tommy and Kathy that they should have been together, that they were the ones truly in love, I was shocked. Throughout the book we've been given examples of closeness between the two, but nothing that screamed destined love. Of course throughout the book I was wondering when Tommy and Kathy would finally end up together, but I never believed them to be meant for each. Is this simply Ishiguro unable to portray the feeling of true love, or a strategic decision to show the students emotional deficiencies? "

bookclub,"Right off the bat I was struck to find that C&amp;P's ""young man"" left his garret, ""as if in two minds.""

Hmm, doesn't the Raskol in Raskolnikov mean split or schism? That's what the Oliver Ready version tells us. Right from the start I'm curious to know if this split is specific to the character or the culture or the philosophy of the book.

Have you noticed anything that stood out in the early going?"
bookclub,"Not able to understand the marginalia and the short ters used in schedules of the book like ''thru"" etc :("
bookclub,"This is a whole-book thread, but I want to focus specfically on irony.

I've taken some from blogs for this initial post, and I encourage
anyone to do the same -- you don't have to rely on just your own
insight when analyzing the book.  All my examples will be from the
first two parts,because I had to return my library copy and haven't
read the end yet.

First of all, I'd argue that there's a deep irony inherent in
portraying the thoughts and perceptions of characters in dystopian fiction
generally: what the narrator says is typically not what what the author means
the reader to take from it. (E.g., ""It was a bright April morning and
the clocks were striking thirteen."" -- the point isn't that it's 1 PM.)

Kathy's matter-of-fact understanding of her life as an organ donor --
a major objective of Ishiguro is to have readers react against that,
and not accept her notions.  And what's the point of doing that?  For
lots of dystopian fiction it's a warning or just a scary story; for
this particular work, I think it sets us up to ask: ""How is being born
for nothing but to die, perhaps to have your best work enjoyed or
memorialized by people you'll never know, perhaps to get some respite
from loving relations, perhaps finding some comfort in memory -- how
is all that like life?""

Kathy expected to be thrilled if she ever found the tape -- instead
she hesitated to announce it -- is this an irony?  What does Ishiguro
use it for?
(http://lawaplit.blogspot.com/2011/08/never-let-me-go-12-situational-irony.html)

The students talk about items ""going to Norfolk"" ironically, as if they
know it's a joke, so is there irony in the mere fact of finding a lost tape
there?  

Is her thinking of a baby while she dances in the empty dorm, watched
by Madame, in any way ironic?

What other ironies do you see?  Separate question, what richness (or
cheapness) do they add to the work?

The irritations of comfort—  
I visit as they rebuild the house  
from within: whitening, straightening,  
bracing the chimney-breast edges  
and forcing warmth, dryness  
and windows with views into  
the cottage below canal-level.  
&amp;nbsp;   
For yes, there’s a canal, bringing  
cold reflections almost to the door,  
and beyond it the main line to Manchester,  
its grid of gantries pale  
against the upland and the sky;  
there’s a towpath pub, where the red-  
haired old landlady  
brings up the beer from the cellar slowly  
in a jug: there’s a chapel  
next door to the cottage, set up  
with a false front and a real  
boiler-house, and—  
rest, my mind—nearby there’s  
a small haulage contractor’s yard.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Everything’s turned up here, except  
a certain complete cast-iron  
housefront, preserved and pinned  
to a blank wall in Ottawa.  
&amp;nbsp;    
This comfort  
beckons. It won’t do. It beckons.  
Driving steadily through rain in  
a watertight car with the wipers going.  
It won’t do. It beckons.

bookclub,"When I was writing the synopsis of Part II, it struck me that Ishiguro is a very efficient writer -- his sentences are always recalling or looking forward, and this achieves compression as on the surface Kathy seems to be spontaneously, conversationally relating not-even-a-tale.   I thought it would be interesting to look at a short bit and comment on what each sentence is doing beyond a ""naive"" this-then-that  narrative.    [Here's a chunk to look at](https://redd.it/5uf3iu), with sentences numbered for e-z-cite.

In the comments, remark on anything you notice about Ishiguro's craftiness in that short passage.
"
bookclub,"Woohoo! Another chapter down! :) How's everyone enjoying Joyce so far? Again, do not feel obligated to answer only these discussion questions. I would like to use them purely as a starting point. 

1. How has Stephen's faith changed compared to Chapter 1? 

2. What is the significance of The Count of Monte Cristo? What impact does it have on Stephen or Joyce,? 

3. Is the argument between Heron and Stephen regarding poets, symbolic of something much greater historically? What is Joyce trying to say in this passage?

4. Stephen begins to think much philosophically and grows more existential in this chapter--he tries to recall childhood memories and contemplates death(again). Is Stephen different or just an angsty teen(Catcher in the Rye style)? 

5. How much has Stephen matured since the end of Chapter 1? 

I'll post more questions throughout the thread.

Thanks everyone!

bookclub,"The bookclub big read of Fyodor Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment starts on Saturday Feb 18. The [schedule is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/5singb/crime_and_punishment_schedule/)

Use this thread to post your early thoughts and expectations for the book. I've been picking some quotes from David Foster Wallace's review of Joseph Frank's Dostoevsky bio. Here's something Wallace said about the content of Dostoevsky's novels:

&gt;""There are murders and attempted murders and police and dysfunctional-family feuding and spies, tough guys and beautiful fallen women and unctuous con men and wasting illnesses and sudden inheritances and silky villains and scheming and whores."" - DFW

I'm looking forward to seeing if some of those elements turn up in Crime and Punishment. And, maybe more importantly, I'm interested to see how Crime and Punishment is still relevant to the world we live in today.

"
bookclub,"In comments, bring up and discuss anything in the book  thru end of part 2.  Below are some sample/starter questions and comments.

The Norfolk trip dominates Part 2.  Formally, this trip bears some
resemblance to a quest.  Do you see it resembling a traditional
narrative, or commenting on one, in that way?

One obstacle Ruth faces in looking for her possible is that Chrissie
and Rodney want to get birthday cards (beginning of ch 14).  Why
birthday cards -- is Ishiguro doing anything sly?

Is there any implied parallel between presumably inaccessible ""dream
futures"" in the novel and real life notions/mental models of how the
world works?  What about the idea that being in love can get you some
kind of ""deferral""?

How do you think of Norfolk, physically?  I think of small, confusing,
easy-to-get-lost-in streets, and cliffs -- I see by search a copy that the
word ""cliff"" comes up six times in the chapter.

Tommy's talk about drawing, equipping creatures, seems like one way of
thinking about creating characters in fiction.  Any thoughts on that?

Chapter Seventeen

&gt; But the fact was, I suppose, there were powerful tides tugging us apart by
then, and it only needed something like that to finish the task. If we'd
understood that back then-who knows?-maybe we'd have kept a tighter hold
of one another.

That sentence sets up the end-of-part-2 chapter nicely and sounds
closely related to the title of the novel.  It is the character Kathy,
making the effort to tell this story, who says it -- what's the relevance
of that passage to getting at Kathy's agenda?

bookclub,"Tuesday is vote-for March day: We'll select two books for March.  I'm
going to make two separate nomination threads.

One will be open, nominate anything.  The other will be any of the
books that was on [the most recent ""accumulation""
list](https://redd.it/5tm1dy) and less than 500 pages long. (I don't
want to do two big reads at the same time)

Also, whatever March book [the Guardian reading
group](https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/reading-group) selects
will be considered ""previously selected"", but we won't have an
official schedule for it unless someone volunteers to lead it.
One of the changes I want to cultivate is tracking along with
other active groups, so we can observe different ways of writing
about reading outside established academic conventions.

Crime and Punishment will be running in March and April also.

For coming months, I have these go-to categories in mind.  If there
are others you'd like to see, let me know

Heavy rotation


 * Gutenberg

Medium Rotation

 * award nominees from last 10 years
 * open

 * commercial fiction

As always, I'm hoping to find people who will be [read

nominating, if you're willing to take on scheduling and
twice-a-week (ish) posting, mention that when you nominate.

Kathy starts by talking about her essay.  ""Essay"" means ""attempt"".  At
this point in the story it seems likely that the essay and the art
work back at Hailsham are likely some way that students can escape,
or some way that the ""system"" can harvest intellectual value from the
students.  Anyway, it appears Kathy and her peers didn't try, from
what I've read, the essay never recurs.

Does the extreme cold and discomfort of the cottages in Winter have
any point?

I don't know **Daniel Deronda** -- do you think there's any reason that
particular novel is what Kathy was reading?  It may just be an illustration
of the type of thing she'd read for her essay.  It comes up in close
proximity to description of an American sitcom with a character who
rolls her eyes and says ""Gawd help us"".

When some people talk about money  
They speak as if it were a mysterious lover  
Who went out to buy milk and never  
Came back, and it makes me nostalgic  
For the years I lived on coffee and bread,  
Hungry all the time, walking to work on payday  
Like a woman journeying for water  
From a village without a well, then living  
One or two nights like everyone else  
On roast chicken and red wine.

*Sample* questions:

There are many, many characters introduced for a single
mention or two.  Kathy remembers specfically who they are and gives
a name.  Is this unusual in fiction?  Why is it unusual and why
does Ishiguro do it?

An interesting  case of an uncharacterized character is Miss Geraldine.
Give a synopsis of an argument between Ishiguro and his editor, the
latter arguing to present Geraldine in the round, Ishiguro arguing to
leave it as it is.

In the luscious creamy pencil case episode:

&gt; Didn’t we all dream from time to time about one guardian or other
bending the rules and doing something special for us? A spontaneous
hug, a secret letter, a gift?

Does that seem natural, that any kid would want to be singled out?

On several occasions, Kathy tells us her memory and Tommy's or Ruth's
diverged.  I believe that in every case Kathy tells us her own memory
was almost certainly or certainly right.  Is this suspicious?

A lot of the interest lies in figuring out what's going on with Hailsham,
how the students differ from the normals.  Since it's about something
that really doesn't exist, does it automatically make the book gimmicky?
Can it be exploring something of deep human interest or have permaent
literary merit if the situation it describes doesn't exist?

How much worse or different would the real world be if Hailsham and
it's students really existed?  Is it impossible to imagine us exploiting
human beings in that way?

The first big reveal, with Miss Lucy staring in the rain, overhearing
the conversation about actors, page 72 in ch 7, the drama is very much
downplaysed, it's immediately obscured and replaced with talk of 
Tommy's unzippable elbow and sex.  Good trick?  Why do it that way?


Is the idea of Norfolk as corner of England where lost things wind
up evocotive to you?  It reminds me a bit of Never-never land and similar
fatastic places.  We're told Kathy and Tommy go there

bookclub,"Maybe I was a knucklehead, but going into this month's selection of *Never Let Me Go* I hadn't realized there was a connection with our last month's selection, *Madame Bovary* by Gustave Flaubert.

I'm only several chapters into the book, but it was a surprise as I was reading that some of the same subjects that Flaubert tackled were also brought up in Ishiguro's book, and then, when Kathy H, the narrator, mentioned a new character, the ""Madame,"" I went ""ah ha!""

Was this a surprise to anyone else? Anyone catch any other references?

Here's what I've caught so far:

Ishiguro humorously makes a connection with Flaubert's masterpiece of French fiction, when Kathy, in Chapter 3, states a confusion about Madame's origins.

&gt;We called her “Madame” because she was French or Belgian—there was a dispute as to which—and that was what the guardians always called her. 

Kathy hasn't been particularly concerned with the nationalities of the other students (maybe they are all from the UK?), so this aside from Kathy foregrounds this Madame character to the reader. We wonder where she is from. I thought that was very cute and nicely done by Ishiguro.

One of the most famous scenes from *Madame Bovary* is how Madame Bovary (Emma), is used as a mirror for other characters, in particular for Charles, her husband. Early on in the book, not long after their wedding, Charles gazes at Emma's eyes and he sees himself, a tiny version, reflected in her eyes. 

&gt;Seen from so close, her [Emma's] eyes appeared larger to him [...] 

&gt; His [Charles] own eyes would lose themselves in those depths, and he would see himself in miniature down to his shoulders, with the silk scarf he wore around his head and the top of his half-open nightshirt. 

As I wrote for our [last month's read](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/5n2qdg/madame_bovary_thru_chapter_9/dc8jzka/), this image could be a literal representation of the [male gaze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_gaze) of Charles. He sees himself in the *act of watching* Emma, and this pleases him rather than cause any worry. He isn't aware of the fact that his view of Emma is a subjectively male idealized version of Emma, which is a limiting view, and one of the reasons why Flaubert suggests there is this growing divide between Charles and Emma. Charles is trapped in his narcissistic-fueled perceptions of Emma, and Emma feels Charles does not understand her, or know the ""real"" Emma.

Again, in Ishiguro's novel, Madame is also used as a mirror, and in the exact same manner, a mirror of someone's gaze. Kathy and the girls play a prank on Madame, by surrounding her, and they want to *see* her surprised reaction.

&gt;And it wasn’t even as though Madame did anything other than what we predicted she’d do: she just froze and waited for us to pass by. She didn’t shriek, or even let out a gasp. But we were all so keenly tuned in to picking up her response, and that’s probably why it had such an effect on us. As she came to a halt, I glanced quickly at her face—as did the others, I’m sure. And I can still see it now, the shudder she seemed to be suppressing, the real dread that one of us would accidentally brush against her. 

&gt;[...]

&gt;Ruth had been right: Madame was afraid of us. But she was afraid of us in the same way someone might be afraid of spiders. We hadn’t been ready for that. It had never occurred to us to wonder how *we* would feel, being seen like that, being the spiders.

Kathy and her friends are shocked by what they see. It's not Madame herself, but how Madame's face is emotionally reflecting an image of Kathy and the girls back at them. Ishiguro's last line there is key. Kathy is surprised of ""being seen"" as ""being the spiders. She is both surprised of being seen as a creature rather than as people, but also of the fact that she is ""being seen"" or watched. This paranoia of being watched by others, including by her fellow students is a big theme so far in the book. 

The student see themselves in Madame's face, just like Charles saw himself in Emma's eyes. The key difference here, however, is that Kathy and the students are troubled by this. They are aware of being seen, and they do not like what they see in the gaze of others seeing them. For Charles, it just reaffirmed his own perceptions of what Emma is, as he literally just saw himself reflected back. For the students, however, this act of being seen and their own reflection being mirrored back at them as a monster, challenges their own perceptions of the world, of who they are, and how the world views them. It shakes their reality in a way that did not happen for Charles.

Kathy later states, at the end of Chapter III, that this is like staring at a literal mirror.

&gt;It’s like walking past a mirror you’ve walked past every day of your life, and suddenly it shows you something else, something troubling and strange.

Anyway, I just thought that was really cool, how Ishiguro is using some of the same elements Flaubert used, but for different purposes. In this case, Madame as a mirroring device is perhaps a liberating moment for Kathy. She becomes aware of a greater hidden truth, eventually sparking a desire to learn more about what is happening, and reorder her memories to form a new narrative about her life (which she is in the process of telling to the reader of the book, and I would argue, to a specific reader that exists in her world, and not in ours. Kathy lives in a parallel world to ours, an imagined past, so her reader, too, is a parallel reader, a mirrored reader to us.).

I wrote in the ""Never Let Me Go - Thru I.3"" thread more about how Ishiguro uses reflection, repetition and mirrors as elements in his novel, especially as a structuring element. I've noticed several scenes have repeated elements that mirror each other, as well as some physical mirrors in the novel, that both reflect images, and sounds as well.  

Here's [my two-part post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/5rttur/never_let_me_go_thru_i3/ddcqd06/) about this and more.

Also, like with Flaubert's novel, Ishiguro seems to be concerned with how narratives are created, how reality for the characters are shaped and how they deliver their stories to the reader. I'm not that far in the book, so I will be curious to see how if any other similarities will emerge.

Anyone else notice any similarities with *Madame Bovary*? Or perhaps with any other works?




"
bookclub,"These may be books that are your personal favorites and would like to discuss them in further detail, maybe there wasn't much enthusiasm when they were being discussed, or maybe you joined after they had already finished with that particular book. "
bookclub,"I know it's been a while since the schedule post. So, I hope everyone is still just as enthusiastic :) don't worry if you're behind schedule, the next discussion will be a week and a half from now--so you have plenty of time. I don't have a ton of experience leading book discussions, so I'll propose a few questions as a starting point,but if you guys would rather discuss other interesting aspects--feel free to do so. Hope you're enjoying the novel! :) 

What is the significance of Joyce's epigraph before the start of the novel? 
""Et ignotas animum dimittit in artes.""

What is the purpose of beginning the novel with a silly children's story? Is he recalling a memory? Or is this written in the present, from baby Stephen's perspective? 

How does Stephen's relationship with women affect his judgment and personal narrative? 

What does Roche represent? Is he actually an antagonist or just a kid that is equally confused/lost regarding his place in the world?

How do Stephen's thoughts/feelings towards god change over the course of the first chapter? Do these feelings represent feelings during this time period?

What's up with the tense political/religious conversation back home midway through the chapter? Is this relevant to events going on at the time in Ireland? 

Why is Stephen the only one to go to the rector about the unjust punishments? 

How does Stephen's love of words impact his understanding of the world and events around him? 

Hope this is a great first discussion! :)




"
bookclub,"I don't especially read a ton of action 'plot heavy' novels; but, I always appreciate a great fight scene or chase scene. What are some of your favorites? They can be Bookclub reads or non :) "
bookclub,"I generally don't enjoy modern bestsellers; they just don't seem to carry the same level of importance, and they don't generally impact me in the way 'literature' does. What are some novels that will change my mind? What ""pop-fiction"" novels should be on someone's 'must read' list? "
bookclub,"These are just sample questions -- feel free to write about anything that struck you in the opening of the book (I know this is a very small section and many of you have read well ahead).  Also, you can post a thread about any part of the book -- there's no need to stick to the schedule

While the narrative is depicting an unfamiliar world, the stated endeavor, to go back and look at her youth, is a familiar set up for fiction.  I'm curious about talking about personal growth in works of speculative fiction, especially dystopia type things.  ""The child is the father of the man"" is a familiar concern of fiction and biography. Is it of the growth of the psyche inherently interesting, even in a made-up world with made-up stressors and opportunities? Thinking about another dystopia, 1984, there's not a lot about Winston's childhood, but the brief memory of of the chocolate bar is haunting.

How does Kathy/Ishiguro build up the impression of Hailsham as a world in itself?

In I.3, talking to Ruth as an adult (one of the first Kathy got to pick, and she started picking six years ago) -- Kathy asks why they went for books of poetry.

  &gt;  But Ruth didn’t get my point—or maybe she was deliberately avoiding it. Maybe she was determined to remember us all as more sophisticated than we were. Or maybe she could sense where my talk was leading, and didn't want us to go that way. . . .

Where *was* Kathy heading?  

Abandoned interest get mentioned twice in Ch 2: Tommy used to enjoy painting and
talking about poetry:

 &gt;   But Christy, she was good, I remember she was. It’s funny, she went right off poems when she started her painting. ﬁnd she was nowhere near as good at that.”

Anything going on here? is changing interest a metric of growth, or are their creative interests especially shallow/fragile?

bookclub,"From Thorpe's translator's introduction:

&gt; The peculiar difficulties that Madame Bovary presents for the
translator include the author’s fondness for the imperfect tense,
varying levels of pastiche, and his habit of extending a certain
lexical field (legal, military, etc.) through a whole paragraph: any
translation has to be alert to changes of nuance and tone that are
micrometrically calibrated, as well as the changing shades of irony,
and attempt to find an equivalent for Flaubert’s verbal mimicry of
wordless states or experiences: This last is part of Flaubert’s
complex music: What he referred to as “style.” No novel, except
perhaps Joyce’s Finnegans Wake, has been more carefully composed at
the level of sound and rhythm: the action seems to seep from the words
themselves.. .


Reading that a clause at  a time I reckon I missed most of what he's calling out:

The **imperfect tense** thing I believe is a written convention and won't convey anything to an English reader, when translated mechanically as logical equivalents..  It sounds like maybe even Flaubert's contemporary French readers don't notice it, and that it was Proust's criticism that brought it to the fore.  Sounds as if in French novels it was common at the time to says something like ""The boys had laughed at his hat"" (perfect) and Flaubert wrote ""The boys laughed at his hat"" (imperfect) -- which of course in English sounds like ""default"" wording.  In French, repeated use of this tense stresses the repeated nature of actions, and thus monotony of day-to-day life.  That monotony of course is what gives the plot its energy -- Monotony + Emma = Sex + Death.

Although not about the imperfect tense, I did see a notable habit of summarizing habitual actions as if they were moment-by-moment-- e.g. end of II.5

&gt;“Besides, he doesn’t love me anymore,” she thought; “What’s to be done? What rescue to expect, What consolation, What relief?”  
&gt;
&gt;She stood broken, panting, inert, sobbing under her breath and With tears trickling down.

In isolation like that, you'd assume it's a scene, something that happened at a specific moment.  But in the narrative, it appears to be something that happens repeatedly, a way of characterizing the days that she is trying to conform to the conventional expectation of a wife.

**varying levels of pastiche** -- ""pastiche"" being playing with borrowed style -- legalese, journalese -- for effect.  At the high level, I think that's related to  the italicized words, which are also ironic.  The subtler pastiche probably escaped me entirely and I wouldn't be confident about what I was seeing if  I did notice it.

**habit of extending a certain
lexical field (legal, military, etc.) through a whole paragraph:** I think I did notice this somewhere with money vocabular pervading a paragraph -- Thorpe gives this example (which is certainly too subtle for me to have noticed) as using accounting terms.  Italics are my guesses about what terms might be 19th C French accounting jargon, but likely there are some I miss:

&gt; So she carried over to him alone the *sum* of hatred which resulted from her vexation, and each effort to *lessen* it merely served to *increase* it; for this needless pain would be *added to other counts* of despair and *contribute* even further to the *separation.* Her very gentleness toward herself occasioned revolts. Domestic competence pushed her into luxuriant fantasies, matrimonial tenderness into adulterous desires. She wished Charles would thrash her, that she could have detested him more *justly*, *taken* her revenge. She amazed herself at times with the atrocious conjectures which *entered* her mind; and she had to go on smiling, hear herself repeat how happy she was, feign being so, suffer it to be believed!

But if ""thrash"" or ""atrocious"" happen to line up with words used in accounting... we wouldn't know. And given the vagueness of Thorpe's footnote, I don't know for sure that's the passage to which he's referring.


**the changing shades of irony,**  well, all modern novels have that problem.  Somewhere Harold Bloom said he fears for future generations being able to understand anything at all about literature because we're losing ability to detect irony.  I have a long quote below that's not the one I'm thinking of.


**and attempt to find an equivalent for Flaubert’s verbal mimicry of wordless states or experiences:**  he gives the example of the ball scene where Emma is turning and spinning.  Getting at wordless states seems to me like one of the core **non**-ironic values of literature.  Two places spring to mind for me, where Flaubert catches a mood that can't be reduced to words: one is where Leon and Emma are floating along with the ""greasy"" or ""fatty"" spots on the water -- the indolence and nebulous pleasure, rotten at the core.  Second, early in the novel, where Charles is drowsing on horseback with scenes and smells from the wards of his student days mingling with warm bed he just left, and the dew of the pre-dawn.

**Flaubert’s complex music: What he referred to as “style.”**: of course in English a vast amount of  the original cadences and sounds are lost.  Most of us would be  pretty much deaf to it anyway, I'm afraid.  Thorpe is a poet; and Lydia Davis writes with extreme compression, so at least both are noted stylists.  Interestingly, Steegmuller's translation often seemed most smooth and pleasing when I compared Thorpe to Steegmuller.

Bloom on Irony from [first google result](https://www.bookbrowse.com/author_interviews/full/index.cfm/author_number/631/harold-bloom)

You talk in the book about contemporary readers having difficulty comprehending irony in literature of earlier times. Why do you think this is a problem?
Irony by definition is the saying of one thing while meaning another, sometimes indeed quite the opposite of what overtly you are saying. It's very difficult to have the highest kind of imaginative literature from Homer through Don DeLillo, as it were, and entirely avoid irony. There is the tragic irony, which one confronts everywhere in Shakespeare, that the audience, the auditor, and the reader are aware of--something in the character or predicament or inward affects, emotions of the protagonist or protagonists, that the heroes and heroines are totally unaware of themselves.
It's very difficult to convey this quality of irony by purely visual means. Visual ironies tend to fall flat or they vulgarize very quickly or they become grotesque. Really subtle irony of any sort demands literary language. The way in which meaning tends to wander in any really interesting literary text, so that the reader is challenged to go into exile with it, catch up with it, learn how to construe it, make it her very own, is essentially a function of irony. If we totally lose our ability to recognize and to understand irony, then we will be doomed to a kind of univocal discourse, which is alright I suppose for politicians' speeches and perhaps for certain representatives of popular religion, but will leave us badly defrauded.

Why make it longer than a month?  I don't like the way the activity 
saps after a read starts. This month we'll have Portait and C+P, but I
also wanted to have the book of the month carry us into March.

Anyway, **posts on any part of the book** are fine now and forever.  Everyone
is always welcome to disregard schedules.  Enrich the fertelizer pile of
[the marginalia thread](https://redd.it/5qecod) and peck it, peacock proud.

bookclub,"**Big reads**   /u/platykurt has sent me a schedule for C+P. I'll get it in the sidebar tonight. That will run mid-Feb thru end of April. Probably we'll do another big read in June and another Sept (I want to keep some flexibility since things are changing and someone might declare a read of some previous toughie like Paradise Lost or Portrait of a Lady and convince everyone to read along).  **The Magic Mountain** seems to have serious interest.  Start thinking about what you want to read.

I think every other month from now on, I'll make a nomination rule similar to this month, that only authors not previously selected can be nominated.  Objections?

**Out of copyright** I don't think bookclub is vital enough yet to go back to routinely selecting two books a month -- we used to routinely have one modern and one Gutenberg (out of copyright) book, but I hope we get there soon. I might do a separate selection for gutenberg where someone volunteers as read runner in the interim.  Ideas, disagreement?

**Guardian Book** Starting April, and for 3 months, I'm going to at least open up a ""marginalia"" thread on whatever the [Guardian Raeding Group](https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/reading-group) selects and see how that goes.  I think it will result in some cross chat that brings more readers this-a-way.  (benevolent poachin).

**Read runner**  Still want someone to run NLMG.   If you might be interested (here's [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/wiki/readrunner)), I've started a sub to support read-runners, r/assume_spoilers -- pm me if you want  access, open to all, but full of spoilers.  Meanwhile, I'll post a schedule for it this weekend, subject to change if someone else takes over.

Thanks -- feel free to bring up any about-the-sub topic/grievance/idea in this thread.

bookclub,"Did Herman Hesse have an adequate understanding of eastern religions to write this type of book? Also, it seems hypocritical for Siddartha to leave Gotama for sexual relations, and a bit arrogant of him to tell Gotama how to teach, is there any literature or discussions about these topics? "
bookclub,"I always like comparing books to their film adaptations (since I was a film major). Any one like to share their thoughts on *Madame Bovary* adaptations. Have you seen, or planning to see, any of them?

I'm going to check out the Claude Chabrol 1991 version starring Isabelle Huppert, since I'm a fan of Chabrol's work, especially of his earlier French New Wave work. Also I'll probably watch the 2014 version directed by Sophia Barnes starring Mia Wasikowska, but there's a whole slew of films.  Ooh, I see there's a 1934 Jean Renoir version, too. Great! I'll have to try and see that. Renoir is one of France's greatest filmmakers, known for his *Rules of the Game* and *La Grande Illusion* films.

Anyone seen the BBC miniseries? 

FYI, Here are some links for the various film adaptions:

bookclub,"Hello! 

We have had an increase in posts that break the rules of /r/BookClub, so to nip that in the bud, I'd like to highlight which posts we encourage, as well as those that will be promptly deleted by the moderators. 

#If you post unacceptable posts, they will be deleted. If you repeat this behavior, or if you harass members/mods attempting to educate you, you will be banned.

Specifically **OKAY**:

* Threads about any past selected book are fine.

* Threads proposing discussion series about previously selected works are (usually get mod support) (see Evergreen rule).

* Threads about the current selection. 

* Meta threads -- about the direction of the sub - are fine.

* Advertisements for other bookish subreddits are okay, keep it to 3 times a year per subreddit. **This only applies to bookish *subreddits*; not websites, YouTube pages, discords, etc...**

 * Announcements of group reads or voting/nominating in other subs is also fine, but they will count under the 3x/year unless an arrangement is reached with the mods. 

* While you can't post links, it's okay to make a text post including a link to a thread in another sub where a substantive conversation about specific books is going on. That is, a conversation where talking about scenes and passages would fit in. Be sure to introduce your link by telling us which subreddit you are linking to and why r/bookclub should want to visit. 

Specifically **NOT** okay: 

* Posts regarding ""live"" book clubs. If you'd like to start a book club in your town, check out your local subreddit, library, or book store. 

* Requests for book suggestions. That is better for /r/suggestmeabook. /r/books also has weekly recurring threads that may also meet your specific book needs. 

* Promotions for your book (or your friend's, auntie's, etc...). If you would like to make a post promoting a future read, you can make a [Campaign] post. More on that below. 
 
* Off topic posts: If it doesn't relate to books, we do not want to see it here. 

**Types of Labeled Posts**: 

* [Meta] - Posts about /r/bookclub. How it is run, things you would like to see, etc. 

* [Scheduled] - These are posts that reference our current books, located in the sidebar. 

* [Evergreen] - These are posts from our [previous selections](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/wiki/previous), led by a community member. If you want to participate in an Evergreen read, suggest it to the club. If you want to run it, feel free to develop a schedule and let the mods know. We will usually throw all of our support behind these. 

* [Campaign] - This is how you pitch a book to the club in between votes. ***Provide a description, and why /r/BookClub should want to read the book.*** There are no strict rules around these books, except you may not profit from the selection of the book you are campaigning for. *This is subject to change.*

 * You can also add books to the [Accumulator](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/8cqihu/the_candidate_accumulator_13/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=bookclub&amp;utm_content=t3_8rg64h) to promote future reads. Occasionally we choose solely from what is available in the accumulator.

For February we will select two books under 500 pages. Please notate your nominations as either CR for Classic Romance or O for Other.

* **One book will be a Classic Romance**: We are defining this as any book that falls in the public domain and covers the topic of romance. Feel free to check Goodreads for your genre. Previously read books are eligible here.

* **The second book has no restrictions, except it cannot be a book we have read before!!**

An anthology of short stories is allowed as long as it meets the other guidelines. Please check the [previous selections](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/wiki/previous) to determine if we have read your selection. A good source to determine the number of pages is Goodreads. 

In this thread, please nominate books in individual comments and upvote any of which you'd participate in the discussion.  ***Nominate one title per comment*** so we can upvote that specific title.

Voting will close Friday, January 24, and be announced Saturday.

bookclub,"**Quick-ish Summary:** And so we reach the end.  The rest of the pieces in the puzzles come together as we meet Mike Evans, the son of an American oil tycoon as disgusted with humanity as Ye but with the bank account to do something about it.  They found the Earth-Trisolaris Organization.  ETO itself fragments into factions between Adventists who hate humanity, Redemptionists who built up a faith around Trisolaran society, and Survivors who just wanted to survive on the winning side.  Ye reveals that Trisolaris managed to ""lock"" humanity's scientific progress by shooting protons at Earth.  Now that's it own in the open, the worlds armed forces come together to stop Evans and get the information he kept from Ye.  Da Shi proposes they use Wang's nanomaterial to slice Evans's ship into the pieces as it crosses the Panama Canal.  Wang witnesses his creation become a weapon, but the plan is successful.  From Evans's reconstructed tapes, we learn that the Trisolarans developed ""sophons,"" or protons transformed into superintelligent computers.  These devices were able to listen in to Earth and to trick humans with what amounted to Scooby-Doo flickering lights and projected countdowns.  More importantly, the sophon was able to alter the results of physics experiments, thus sabotaging humanity's progress.  Trisolaris issues one last message, ""You're bugs!""  Ye may consider it sunset for humanity, but Wang and Da Shi find hope in Trisolaris's taunt and get back to work.

&amp;#x200B;

Kickstart questions for our last discussion:

* The book references a theory that First Contact as a rallying symbol is more important than the contact itself.  If it had been 1960s in the US, how might that symbol have changed?  What about today?
* Is Mike Evans a sympathetic figure?
* What do you think of the confrontation between Da Shi and Colonel Stanton?  And now that we've made it to the end - Da Shi - love him or hate him?
* What did you picture in your head when Liu describes unfolding the proton into eyes?  Was it alive?
* What do you think of Shi's locust fable?

&gt;""I just want to ask the two of you one question: Is the technological gap between humans and Trisolarans greater than the one between locusts and humans?""

* Given Liu's public political stances, what do you make of this quote from his post script in the American edition:

&gt;On Earth, humankind can step onto another continent, and without a thought, destroy the kindred civilizations found there through warfare and disease. But when they gaze up at the stars, they turn sentimental and believe that if extraterrestrial intelligences exist, they must be civilizations bound by universal, noble, moral constraints, as if cherishing and loving different forms of life are parts of a self-evident universal code of conduct.  
&gt;  
&gt;I think it should be precisely the opposite: Let's turn the kindness we show toward the stars to members of the human race on Earth and build up the trust and understanding between the different peoples and civilizations that make up humanity.  But for the universe outside the solar system, we should be ever vigilant, and be ready to attribute the worst of intentions to any Others that might exist in space.  For a fragile civilization like ours, this is without a doubt the most responsible path.

&amp;#x200B;

bookclub,"Our January selection is *Moon of the Crusted Snow* by Waubgeshig Rice.

Full disclosure, it didn't have the most votes. By the time I got to the post, *Where the Crawdads Sing* and *Circe* were tied for 22 votes each. But because the point of a discovery read is to read lesser-known titles, and the previous two are hugely popular, I bypassed them for the next highest-voted title. I apologize to anyone who feels that I should have chosen one of these. If you would like to lead one, please message me and we'll make it happen.

When I was looking at everything on Goodreads, I noticed that they list the number of ratings each book has; that might help us gauge popularity in the future, rather than me posting a dozen rules meant to filter out popular titles and not quite succeeding.

A schedule for *Moon of the Crusted Snow* will go up by the end of the weekend. It looks great and I hope you join us."
bookclub,"Hello! Will anyone be up for reading The Brothers Karamazov? Like, a reading buddy. Let me know if that interests you. I mostly want to read Classics this year."
bookclub,"It's time for another Discovery Read! For January, we’re looking specifically for authors who aren’t particularly well-known. We’re brand new at this, and our first attempts at it are going to be kind of clumsy, because you just know that we missed some obvious well-known author in our list below, or else we added too many and no one can think of anyone to nominate. We’re defining “obscure” as:

1. Not an author in the below list 
2. But on par with the authors below, so no Stephen Kings, J. K. Rowlings or Neil Gaimans 
3. Not generally well-known; I left C. S. Lewis and Don DeLillo out on purpose just so I could point out that they're not good choices either for this exact reason 
4. Not something we’ve done before 
5. Has not had a movie made about it, or at least not in English 
6. Hasn’t won a Nobel or a Pulitzer or a Man Booker 
7. Isn’t something the average person would read in high school 
8. Fiction
9. Not published in the last year
10. Available as an ebook and not outrageously expensive (we learned this lesson back in September)

We won’t call you out if your book breaks the rules, we’ll just quietly skip it. No risk. If you need inspiration, check out awards shortlists for years past and see what you like. I \*do\* want to add that nearly any of the below authors are excellent choices in non-restrictive months. (A few might be overdone.)

bookclub,"**Quick-ish Summary:** Time skip! We meet Wang Miao who is recruited by loose-canon Holmesian cop, Da Shi, to assist with uncovering a conspiracy. Wang is taken to a military compound staffed with not only Chinese police and military, but also NATO and CIA officers - it seems the world is watching. Apparently, elite scientists are committing suicide and there is a murky connection to a research group, Frontiers of Science. One victim stands out in particular to Wang - Yang Dong - who left a note claiming that physics wasn’t real. Ding Yi, Yang’s boyfriend, explains to Wang that particle accelerator tests with their inconsistent, wild results really do seem to point to everything being wrong and maybe the laws of physics we all know don't even exist. But now that Wang has accepted this assignment, terrifying things are starting to happen - a countdown has appeared on only his photos and now before his very eyes. Wang goes to see Shen Yufei from the Frontiers of Science. After she finished her game of 3body and he tells his story, she advises Wang to stop his nanomaterials research. Oddly enough, it works. She clearly knows something, especially after Wang overhears a confrontation with environmentalist Pan Han who delivers a warning (or a threat) against whatever research it is she and her husband are doing. Shen tells Wang how to see the countdown on a grander scale and that “the entire universe will flicker for you” when his nanomaterials work picks back up in 3 days.

What would you add if you had to summarize the reading?

&amp;#x200B;

Some discussion questions to kickstart conversation: 

* About 30 or 40 years have passed since we left Ye Wenjie at Red Coast.  Do you think she's still there?
* In the first reading, Ye Zhetai (Ye Wenjie's father) had some thoughts about how his wife had tried to conform her teaching to revolutionary attitudes and challenges his accusers that ""philosophy falling from the sky"" can't guide scientific experiments, science is born from experience.  How does that stand up against what Yang Dong uncovered and what Ding Yi/Wang Miao are experiencing now in the story?  
* How do you feel about the Shooter/Farmer hypothesis?
* Da Shi - love him or hate him? :D
* What were some words/phrases/quotes that stood out to you?
* If you are the marginalia type, what are some of your margin notes?  
 

Please mark spoilers if you want to discuss something past the reading. Hope you're enjoying the book!"
bookclub,"**Quick Summary:** Ye Wenjie witnesses her mother and father's struggle session - admittedly it's her father on stage, but her mother has to make a terrible choice and finds herself one of his accusers.  Her father dead, her mother broken, we catch back up with Ye in the lumber camp where she's been given a second chance.  Bai Mulin gives her a copy of Silent Spring, but betrays her and uses her passion to send an incriminating letter to the government to stop the environmental nightmare they're creating.  Alone in a cell, Ye is offered a chance for leniency in exchange for speaking against her father.  She declines.  Left to die in the cold, Ye finds herself on a helicopter headed to Red Coast.  Despite the Cultural Revolution, China needs scientists with her skillset it seems.  Ye accepts an offer to stay forever and we are given a preview of whatever it is Red Coast is doing.

Some discussion questions to kick us off - remember, post whatever you would like to discuss, this is just to help kickstart the conversation.

- What do you think of Ye's growing philosophy on humanity?

bookclub,Here's a discussion post for chapters 8-10 of Things Fall Apart. What are your thoughts?
bookclub,"This discussion covers chapters 1-3 of Things Fall Apart.

I haven’t read yet, I spent the day asleep and hurting. The little bastard comes out on Friday and I will be more present for discussions this weekend! I also intend to come back in and comment later, when I’ve gotten the section read.

What did you think? Any symbols? What do you think of the main character? How does his life seem right now? How is the prose different from Toni Morrison’s, if you read Beloved with us last month?"
bookclub,"Do you love it? Do you hate it? Why?

(A question to those familiar with the book: how important is it that I always go where directed in the footnotes? A few times a footnote will have me jumping to chapters hundreds of pages forward (like 'See Tom's Story') which seem like huge spoilers to me.)"
bookclub,How about a Hugo or Nebula award winner for December?

I loved that it maintained the familiars perspective, everything we learned coming from them. I adored that Sherlock was a werewolf! I've never seen anything in his stories indicating that, so it was cool. Seriously, this book was so fun for me! 

Tell me your thoughts! Especially if it have any about the switch at the end."

My comments tomorrow."
bookclub,"Continuing our themes, for November and American Thanksgiving we are doing a novel by an indigenous author.

For this read, we are looking for a novel (fiction) by a member of an indigenous group that was or is under European occupation. Examples include the obvious, such as native Americans and Canadians, but also Australian aborigines, Polynesians, Brazilians, Mayans, Algerians, Congolese, etc. Short stories and poems don't count. Plays are fine.

Please also ensure that your nomination is around or under 500 pages, and that we [haven't done it before](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/wiki/previous). Nominations should also be easy to find and available as ebooks.

In this thread, please nominate books in individual comments and upvote any of which you'd participate in the discussion. Nominate one title per comment so we can upvote that specific title.

Greetings, r/BookClub. I just wanted to announce that r/ThomasPynchon will be conducting a group read of Thomas Pynchon's second novel, *The Crying of Lot 49* starting next month, on 22 November 2019, for 8 weeks. Tentatively, the schedule will be as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

|Dates|Chapters|Discussion Leader|
|:-|:-|:-|
|22 November 2019|Reading Commences|\-|
|29 November 2019|Chapter One|u/FrenesiGates|

This past summer, we finished up a [group read](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThomasPynchon/wiki/readinggroups/v) of Thomas Pynchon's *V.* that went rather well. If you're interested, join us over at the sub, and keep an eye out for the start of the book. This is a wonderful opportunity for readers who haven't explored Pynchon and veteran Pynchonians who'd like to revisit his earlier works (or perhaps people who've tried to read his work in the past and not been able to complete it). 

Based on how terrifically the *V.* group went, we will likely be coordinating these group reads every winter and summer, making our way chronologically through his published works. *Gravity's Rainbow* is projected to be scheduled for Summer of '20, so if you've been looking to read it, but may have been too discouraged by its length or complexity, that will also be a good opportunity to jump in.

I'm usually very uncomfortable with blameless self-promotion, but this felt like a good place to find some folks who might be genuinely interested in a project like this.

Thanks for listening!

bookclub,"Hey guys. Sorry this is late, getting ready for this vacation and Thanksgiving is a bit overwhelming. 

Just tell me what you think. Anything goes. I'll respond when I can m 😉"
bookclub,"Heyo. My comments likely won't make it here until tomorrow, I'm beat.

This covers the section from ""Upstairs Beloved was dancing"" to ""Out of sight of Mister's sight"". What did you think? What did you not quite understand? Any parts you liked or didn't, any insights you want to share?"
bookclub,"This covers the section from the start of the book to “Pleasantly troubled, Sethe...”

Daaaaamn, you guys, I remembered this being a good book, but I think I forgot how good it actually was. And I’m surprised at how much is revealed early on, and how little is subtext. We learn right away that the house, 124, contains the ghost of a baby who has died violently, and this situation is central to the story.

My observations in the comments. I really want to hear what you guys think!"
bookclub,Hey guys! What do you think so far? Initial impressions? Do you think it's scary? Confusing? Anything! 😁
bookclub,"Hey, guys. The version I'm using of this book doesn't really have chapters, but dates. As such, I'm going to make the schedule using pages with the dates as rough stopping points.

The dates in the book will not coincide with the dates on the schedule! So, IB will be my abbreviation for ""in book"", in reference to dates.

My version has 192 pages, which gives us about 6.5 pages per day. 

#Schedule:

October 4: Through October 14 IB

October 11: October 15 IB - October 21 IB

October 17: October 22 IB - October October 23 IB

October 24: October 24 IB - October 29 IB

October 30: Final

I really hope this makes sense. 

I am going on vacation in the middle of October, so if anyone wants to help with the discussions on the 17th and 24th, it will be greatly appreciated!"
bookclub,"Buckle up, we’re going on another slavery journey! If you liked *I, Tituba*, you’ll probably like *Beloved*. I would go so far as to call it one of the best books ever written, about a horrific moral choice made by a lot of women in slavery. I also want to draw some parallels to *Tituba*.

Here’s the schedule. There’s a weird stopping/starting point kind of in the middle of a chapter, but there are no chapter numbers or titles, and the first sentence of the next chapter is (I think, it’s been several years) a major spoiler.

* 10/6 - Beginning to “Pleasantly troubled, Sethe...”
* 10/9 - “Pleasantly troubled, Sethe...” to “Upstairs Beloved was dancing” 
* 10/13 - “Upstairs Beloved was dancing” to “Out of sight of Mister’s sight...”
* 10/16 - “Out of sight of Mister’s sight...” to “In the back of Baby Suggs’ mind...”
* 10/20 - “In the back of Baby Suggs’ mind...” to “She was crawling already...”
* 10/23 - “She was crawling already...” to “One more curve in the road...” (This is in the middle of a chapter, at the start of a section)
* 10/27 - “One more curve in the road...” to III (“124 was quiet.”)
* 10/30 - “124 was quiet” to end

Happy reading! I’ll see you here on the 6th."
bookclub,"Hey guys. I am in the hospital with gallbladder issues and on enough pain meds to have chosen a favorite opiate, so I am posting our discussion today rather than tomorrow. If I get some reading done I'll make some comments, but if not, you're on your own.

 HAPPY VOTING!"
bookclub,"Wow, a lot happened here, and my heart is aching. But I want to know what you think. What themes did you notice? Any particular sentences or prose that was set apart for you? How do you view the trial or deposition?"
bookclub,"Edit: I messed up the title - this is for section 5.1 - 6.4 (or anything before that). 

The Trump of the Graveyard announces two new corpses (in separate interludes). Caitriona, as usual, hopes it is her son's wife, but it isn't. After hearing that Nora Sheainin's daughter had a fight with Big Brian's Mag, and Nell, Caitriona changes her opinion of Nora Sheainin's daughter completely! She learns that the plans for her cross have been abandoned. As usual, Caitriona is not interested in anything that concerns the new corpses, just in hearing news relevant to her.        

There's an interesting wordplay highlighted in the footnotes of the GC translation. I'd be interested to see how it's presented in the DD translation. In 5.3, they are discussing a garbled and a parodic version of folklore about Oliver Cromwell. In the text: 'he pushed Michael back as far as Shellig Michael'. 
The footnote:*what looks like a typing error is in fact a play on words. Seilg (Shellig) means 'persuit', and Seilg Mhichil (Shellig Michael) means Persuit of Michael. As St. Michael is being perused by the Devil between Conamara and the Aran Islands the author invents his own island, Seilg Mhichil (Shellig Michael), which looks like and sounds like the real Skellig Michael (Sceilg Mhichil) off the Kerry Coast, famous for its ancient monastic settlement of beehive huts. Sceilg means a steep rock.         

Have you noticed any other wordplay? Any sections that stood out to you? Anything you want to discuss or ask questions about? We are now half way through. Any predictions (no spoilers!) about the rest of the book?"
bookclub,So! What do you think?
bookclub,"Hey, all. I made a mistake and am forced to correct it. I miscounted the chapters in the book, not realizing there were 2 parts. As a result, we are nearly finished with Part I. I have created an alternate schedule that will allow us to finish on time. 

#You do not need to follow along with the schedule! 

* Remember, you can read at your pace and post when you want to. The schedule is to let you know when the read runners will be posting a discussion post about the relevant chapters, but you can always participate on your schedule by: 
 * Creating your own threads; 
 * Creating new, top-level comments on existing discussion threads;
 * Commenting on another person's top-level comment or discussion thread; 

So, here is the new schedule. 

September 14: Finish Part I (Through Part I: Chapter 12). 

September 17: Part II: Chapters 1-3

September 19: Part II: Chapters 4-7

September 23: Part II: Chapters 8-11

September 26: Part II: Chapters 12-13

September 30: Part II: Chapters 14-15 + Epilogue

While the initial burst right here at the beginning is adding an addition 15 pages a day, after that we are slowing down to a pace of about 15 pages per check-in. As I said, it is okay to take your time and post on your schedule. 

I'm really sorry for the confusion. If you have any questions or comments, post them here."
bookclub,"In this section:   
Several blame Siuan for their deaths, and acuse Peadar the pub of dishonest practices and theft. Peader retaliates by telling everyone that Nora, his political opponent was a drunkard. I enjoyed this quote from Nora: 'an election isn't half as cultural as I expected'. Neither Peader nor Nora win the election and they are reconciled afterwards.      

We hear from the Trump of the Graveyard again - what do you think of these sections? It's quite different from the rest of the book.     

There is another new corpse - Brid Terry - who gives news to Caitriona about her family and the community - Nora Sheainin's daughter has had a baby, and not died as Caitriona expected (hoped?!). Nell's son has also recovered. Caitriona believes Nell has asked the priest to perform what is effectively black magic, to bring her family good fortune. The Master's wife has remarried and Brid tells him that his wife said he told her to remarry after his death.

Really, what do you think? How are you finding it? Any favorite quotes? What themes are you noticing? 

I'll respond in the comments to these questions and we can go from there. :)"
bookclub,"Honestly idk what it is about this book but something has pulled me in immediately.   
Im 60 pages in right now and wish i had more time to read this book. Its got such real vivid characterization without a whole lot of excess detail. Its a beautiful with the writing style of this book. 
Who’s your favorite characters and why?
What significance have u reaped from the books(intro only please no spoilers)?
  
   
I just wanted to see if anyone would discuss the book with me in a pm convo?"
bookclub,"Well, after all the eye rolling after chapter 37, what do you think of the end?

The most noticeable plot thing is the swerve back to St John, 
fulfilling his calling without complaint.

Rochester regaining partial sight -- I think Bronte's aim in that
is that it makes him less pathetic, he gets to participate in being
a ""whole"" human being.


To me, not having anything about Bessie or Mrs. Fairfax seems to
not fit the ""all the loose ends tidied"" up tone."
bookclub,"Let’s discuss *I, Tituba*, Chapters 1-2. Quick summary:

Tituba’s teenage mother is raped on board a slave ship to Barbados. When she starts to show, her owner banishes her from the house to the fields, and gives her to a slave who loves her and raises Tituba as his own. When Tituba is seven, her owner notices her mother, and her mother defends herself against the second rape. Her mother is executed, her father sold, and Tituba is run off the plantation.

An old mystic woman takes her in and teaches her the tools of the trade. She dies when Tituba is 14. Tituba lives alone in the marsh until she meets John Indian, a slave who is apparently content with his life. Despite the counsel of her mother’s and the mystic’s ghosts, she works some magic and goes off to the city to be with him.

What did you like about this section? Is there anything you noticed that you want to bring up? I assume we all know what’s going to happen to Tituba later in life; how do you feel about watching her inch toward it?"
bookclub,"Welcome to the first scheduled post for Graveyard Clay, also translated from the original Irish, Cre Na Cille (please forgive my lack of accents on the Irish throughout this post, I'm on mobile) as The Dirty Dust. It's written almost entirely as dialogue - what do you think of that? Do you like it so far? I'm finding it to be funny!      

At the start, we meet Caitriona Phaidin, who has apparently already died and been buried, and is worrying about the plot they buried her in and other details of the funeral! As the section goes on, we start to learn about the people in Caitriona's life (and death!) and all the arguments and grudges, that continue after death.      

The translations - it seems the two translations are quite different. Graveyard Clay is apparently more faithful to the original, where The Dirty Dust is freer and focuses on the feeling and meaning of the original. It'll be interesting to compare as we go along. I'm reading Graveyard Clay.       

How are you finding the language, and the Irish names? I'm going to ATTEMPT to give a pronunciation guide to some of the names that came up in the first 20 or so pages - these characters are not necessarily major characters, it's just to give a flavour of the Irish. I'm not an Irish speaker, so please take this with a pinch of salt, and correct me if you know better!              

*Padraig - paw-drig    
*Tadhg - Tyg (like tiger without the r)   
*Eamonn - aim-an    
*Stiofan - shtee-fan    
*Caitriona - ca-treena or ca-tree-uh-na    
*mairin - maw-reen    
*siuan - swahn     
*peadar - Pader    

Any topics or themes you want to discuss? Feel free to make your own posts in between scheduled posts, just be sure to mark spoilers!"
bookclub,"Good LORD. I think I strained something, rolling my eyes.

What did you think?"
bookclub,"Hey guys, 

Alright, we are going to use this final post to discuss what you DID like about the book, what you learned (if anything) through reading, and what symbols/themes caught your eye. 

I know a lot of people complained about not liking the book. They said there was little to no plot and that it seemed like everyone was just drinking and not caring about anything. This is actually one of the major themes of the book. Hemingway was examining the ""Lost Generation"" after WWI. The war left people broken. Knowing this, does it change your opinion of the book at all? 

The bullfights are symbolic of many things, but consider them as a symbol for the masculinity portrayed in the book. The weak are murdered, either by the strong or in the ring by other men. There are castrated bulls that must calm the others (think Jake with his impotence). What do you think of this connection? What other symbols stuck out to you during the book? 

Brett and Romero end their relationship after Brett finds she is ""in trouble,"" and sends him away, calling Jake to help her once again. She claims she sent him away for his own good, but it also seems she is desperate to keep what freedom she has. What do you think about this situation? 

Did anything else stick out to you? How did you feel about Cohn losing control? Did the racism in the book bother you? Any thoughts at all are welcome!"
bookclub,"*Graveyard Clay* is divided into 10 ""interludes"", which are subdivided into smaller chapters. To make it easy to reference, we're going to refer to them in an Interlude.Chapter format. The main discussion posts will go up on the following dates:

* 9/4 - 1.1 through 2.1
* 9/8 - 2.2 through 3.4
* 9/11 - 3.5 through 4.6
* 9/15 - 5.1 through 6.4

* 9/29 - 10.1 - end

You can always post about a book outside the discussion posts -- we only ask that you label spoilers and leave them out of titles if you've read ahead.

We are also reading *I, Tituba*, whose schedule should be posted within the next day or two."
bookclub,"Because *I, Tituba* is proving difficult and expensive for some people to find, we are also running a second read, *Graveyard Clay* by Máirtín Ó Cadhain, which was the runner-up in this month’s voting. I was easily able to find it on both Kindle and Google Play. It was originally written in Irish and there seem to be two translations, one translated as *Graveyard Clay* and the other as *The Dirty Dust*. I don’t know if it matters which one you choose; it hasn’t for the Russian literature we’ve done.

I’ll have a schedule up within a day or two, but please assume we’ll start a few days to a week into September; that should give you time to locate and acquire the book."
bookclub,"Hi,

New to the bookclub but I'd like to recommend authors outside North American and Britain for the next bookclub selection.  While the Discovery Reads is a great idea reading and knowing the world outside of those perspectives would be great. Hope there will be more nominations and selections that reflect our diverse world."
bookclub,"We're getting to the end of 2010 Big Read . . .  

Summary: In previous weeks, Jane split her windfall of 20,000 pounds
among her nephew and nieces, and began preparing for . . . what? A
life of social and intellectual engagement, it doesn't seem much
clearer.  She makes the Moor House tidy and spruce.

She still cares for and tries to get information about Rochester.

St. John tries to recruit her to come to India with him; she agrees
to come as an aide, or ""curate"", but not to marry him.

Next week: Ch 36 and 37, and the week after that is the last chapter."

bookclub,"*No spoilers*

I decided to finish the rest of Fiesta: The Sun Also Rises last night. It seems that the reading is going to die which is strange for such a short book.

I noticed that a lot of people have been saying that the book is boring and that nothing is happening which I have to agree with in some ways but disagree in others. 

Yes, it seems that the book seems to just be a retelling of a trip that some guy took to Spain with his buddies and there are some tensions between the people going. But, isn't there something interesting about trying to put yourself in Jakes shoes and be amongst that while trying to remain as unattached and as seemingly uninvolved as he is. Yes it is mundane but so is real life and therefore this seems to be a book about how this character deals with real life in his class group, this country and this time period. The detachment I stated is a common theme in stories of the Lost Generation which seem to portray their characters in a self centred way. This book also somewhat reminds me of the book, American psycho. It has a similar feel of a first person narrative, a detached protagonist, seemingly uninteresting characters and a mundane story (for the most part.) However, I find that book the most interesting when I try to read a little into the boring characters and the little things they say. Sometimes I like to imagine what the story would be like if it were written from another characters perspective. What would our story be like if it were written from Brett's perspective? Or Robert Cohen? Maybe everyone is a little too involved in their own heads. Maybe everybody keeps a small piece of themselves reserved even in front of their closest friends. Maybe that's just people in a social class that encourages constant drinking out and socialising with people you don't particularly like. 

I do agree that the book isn't so very riveting, I probably won't read it again. Maybe I'm reading too much in to the characters and writing style of the author. But I do think there is an important message in this book."
bookclub,"In this section, Jake and co first go to a rural town for fishing, then onto to Pamplona for the bull fight. There is a lot more nature in this section, which is a contrast with previous scenes in the city. They actually do things here - dig for worms, catch fish etc, and it brings a sense of peace they didn't have in the city. There is competition in the fishing, but it is simple, and doesn't make anyone feel insecure. They can actually speak honestly about Brett (Bill asks if Jake was in love with her). But as soon as he hears from Brett, Jake leaves this relative peace behind.      

There's a further hint about Jake's injury - Bill says that some people think Jake is impotent. Jake responds that he isn't, he's just had an accident. Jake is worried that Bill will stop teasing him for fear of hurting his feelings - he actually wants Bill to tease him, to be treated normally.       

I was quite interested in the section where Bill tells Jake that he is more fond of him than anyone else, and that he couldn't say that in New York because people would think he was a 'faggot'. It's a continuation of the masculine imagine theme. During the war, they came to have really intense bonds, taking care of each other, but they actually feel insecure about those feelings now.       

What do you think about the section with the bulls in Chapter 13? Jake and Montoya agree they have a bad feeling about the bulls, which seems ominous.      

Anything in particular stand out for you?
Anything you want to discuss from this section, or the book so far? Over to you!"
bookclub,"I'm so sorry, I completely forgot to post! I'll set myself reminders for the rest of the book.

What did you think? Who's still with us? Favorite parts? Symbolism? Predictions?"
bookclub,"I’m sure we’ve all noticed that we’ve been doing a lot of well-known books lately: things like *Jane Eyre* and *1984*. It’s only natural; we let the subreddit vote, and people generally vote for what they’ve heard of.


We want to move the subreddit toward more obscure works, so for September we’ll looking specifically for authors who aren’t particularly well-known. We’re brand new at this, and our first attempts at it are going to be kind of clumsy, because you just know that we missed some obvious well-known author in our list below, or else we added too many and no one can think of anyone to nominate. We’re defining “obscure” as: 


1. Not an author in the below list 

2. But on par with the authors below, so no Stephen Kings, J. K. Rowlings or Neil Gaimans 

3. Not generally well-known; I left C. S. Lewis and Don DeLillo out on purpose just so I could point out that they're not good choices either for this exact reason 

4. Not something we’ve done before 

5. Has not had a movie made about it, or at least not in English 

6. Hasn’t won a Nobel or a Pulitzer or a Man Booker 

7. Isn’t something the average person would read in high school 

8. Fiction

9. Not published in the last year


We won’t call you out if your book breaks the rules, we’ll just quietly skip it. No risk. If you need inspiration, check out awards shortlists for years past and see what you like. I \*do\* want to add that nearly any of the below authors are excellent choices in non-restrictive months. (A few might be overdone.) I bet you can comb through the list and find some stuff you’d like to nominate at a later time.

HAPPY VOTING!


Voting will be closed at the end of the day, PDT, on August 22nd, and the winner will be announced the next day."
bookclub,"We're almost halfway through the book now, and are now in Spain. Are you enjoying it? Why? Why not? I'll confess, I'm not, which disappoints me because I've enjoyed Hemingway in the past. I'm finding it hard work in places, and I don't care for all the detail about Paris streets, but more on that below.      

Does anybody else sometimes have trouble knowing who's saying what? Several times, there is a group of people, and they make several statements, one after the other, with no indication of who's speaking. Do you think this is deliberate? What effect does it have? Or is it just me?!!      

In the previous scheduled post, u/derkkaa asked why there is so much detail given about Paris street names - paragraphs describing Jake going from one street to another. They are constantly moving, looking for something or somewhere new, even going to Spain. Is this listing of street names done to give the impression of constant movement? Is it part of a stream of consciousness narrative? What do you think about this?     

There is a lot of competition between the men, often focused on Brett. We learn that Brett has been away with Cohn, which prompts Jake's jealousy. Jake is also jealous when seeing Brett with Mike. As they travel out to Spain, this competition eases, but when the subject of Brett's arrival is raised, competition comes back in the form of the bet between Cohn and Bill. All of this seems to be about the characters trying to assert their masculinity, which, along with insecurity, is a recurring theme.      

What are your thoughts on this section, and the book so far? Any parts that particularly interested you? Are you still finding it witty?"
bookclub,"This is the scheduled post for ch 28-30 in our Big Read, Jane Eyre.
In comments below, share your thoughts -- any passages you like? 
How are themes developed?  As always, it's fine to start a separate
thread to pursue one topic, and fine to talk about earlier parts of 
the book.

Next Saturday, Aug 17, will chapters 31-33

Recap: Ch 28:

Having fled Thornfield and Rochester, Jane spends a night sleeping
in a field, then unsuccessfully seeks work in a small village.  The next
night, near starving, she comes on a cottage in the woods; is rebuffed
by the housekeeper but given shelter by The Man of The House.

Ch 29: Jane recovers in the house for three days and is given a welcome
by a family who turn out to be gathered after the death of their father.

Ch 30: St John Rivers was planning on opening a school for girls and
offers the role of teaching it it to Jane."
bookclub,"There are several themes in this book. One thing that struck me was the turnover of relationships - there is a lot of casual mention of divorce. Brett talks about her divorce, and also about marrying someone else, while seemingly having some kind of relationship with Jake. Do you think the characters seem quite casual about relationships, even marriage (or end of marriage)?    

There's another small hint about Jake's injury - he met Brett in the hospital when she was working as a volunteer nurse, presumably he was a patient.    

The lost generation seems to be a continuing theme in this book. They are all drinking to forget - note Brett's claims not to remember because she was drunk. The Count however, seems separate from this - he drinks, but he actually enjoys alcohol. Has his life not been as affected by the war as the others? But he does have a wound. Or is it because he has been involved in several wars, so WWI didn't have the same impact on him? I'm finding it interesting how we're given the impression that the war had a big impact on these characters, without being told much about the actual war.     

What stuck out to you? Any observations you'd like to discuss?"
bookclub,"The Three Musketeers by Dumas is a childhood favorite book. I have been looking for English translation for my personal library. I have heard of 4 major ones; Public Domain, William Barrow, Richars Pevear, &amp; the 2018 Lawrence Ellsworth. Anyone know the major difference between the translations? Which translation would you recommend for purchase today?"
bookclub,"Hello, and welcome to the first post for *The Sun Also Rises* by Ernest Hemingway. 

In contrast to the extreme emphasis on empathy in last month's read, I am shocked by the lack of empathy in this novel. I'm certain it only surprised me because of the book I read before, but what do you think? Do the characters initially present as selfish, uncaring, and somewhat mean? 

What themes did you notice as you read these chapters? Do you like his style of writing, so far?"
bookclub,What did you think? Any ideas about what might be happening next? Any omg moments? Did you love anything?

bookclub,"I decided to re-read H.G. Wells War of the Worlds and I'm only 33 pages in so far but I'm absolutely astounded by his extreme knowledge about Mars. He was talking about the temperature, the distance, the gravity difference of Mars vs Earth. I was so unaware of how much people knew about space in the 1890s. It's amazing."
bookclub,"**THIS IS NOT A NOMINATION POST!** Come back in mid August for the real deal. I'm posting this purely to let you know what's coming, and give you a chance to look around for books you might like to read.

I’m sure we’ve all noticed that we’ve been doing a lot of well-known books lately: things like *Jane Eyre* and *1984*. It’s only natural; we let the subreddit vote, and people generally vote for what they’ve heard of.

We want to move the subreddit toward more obscure works, so for September we’ll looking specifically for authors who aren’t particularly well-known. We’re brand new at this, and our first attempts at it are going to be kind of clumsy, because you just know that we missed some super well-known author in our list below, or else we added too many and no one can think of anyone to nominate. We’re defining “obscure” as: 

1. Not an author in the below list 
2. But on par with the authors below, so no Stephen Kings, J. K. Rowlings or Neil Gaimans 
3. Not generally well-known; I left C. S. Lewis and Don DeLillo out on purpose just so I could point out that they're not good choices either for this exact reason 
4. Not something we’ve done before 
5. Has not had a movie made about it, or at least not in English 
6. Hasn’t won a Nobel or a Pulitzer or a Man Booker 
7. Isn’t something the average person would read in high school 

Some good examples that we’ve already done: 

*Revolutionary Road* by Richard Yates

*The Vegetarian* by Han Kang 

We won’t call you out if your book breaks the rules, we’ll just quietly skip it. No risk. If you need inspiration, check out awards shortlists for years past and see what you like. I \*do\* want to add that nearly any of the below authors are excellent choices in non-restrictive months. (A few might be overdone.) I bet you can comb through the list and find some stuff you’d like to nominate at a later time.

For the September read, we will be attempting something new. We are initiating a **Discovery Read**. When we announce these reads, attached will be a list of authors that are *not allowed*. You can nominate pretty much anything else that does not otherwise violate our normal rules, but we are hoping for more challenging reads that force us to take our discussion a bit farther. 

This will likely occur every few months, like our Gutenberg and Big reads. I am only mentioning it now so we can keep our eyes peeled for things we might want to nominate. We will be posting the restricted list soon, so everyone can look it over and voice any concerns."

week, Aug 3, just two chapters, 26 and 27.   [Here is the schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/bvoqqv/jane_eyre_schedule/)


Well, the novel take a sharp turn, there are open declarations, the
narrative plunges toward marriage, the traditional culmination of love
stories.  It must be a head-fake, since we're just past half-way thru
the novel.  Or will this be a mold breaker, with the marriage just
a stopping point in R &amp; J's relationship?

What passages, themes, techniques struck you as notable in this week's
reading?  


A summary of this week's events

Ch 23: Cigar-smelling Rochester extracts a declaration of love
from Jane and returns it.  Their kissing in the hall scandalizes Fairfax.

Ch 24: Off to town to buy dresses; a fairy story for Adèle about taking
Jane to the moon; singing at the fireplace.

Ch 25: The day before the wedding; at her master's knee Jane tells him
of the dream and apparition that rent the real veil; he tells her it
must have been Grace Poole."

bookclub,This is the discussion post for chapters 21-22 of Jane Eyre. What are your thoughts?
bookclub,"Is anyone interested in doing a read through of this alongside me? I am at chapter 8 right now, about 70 pages in. I love Steinbeck, so far I've read Of mice and men (for school) and Sweet Thursday and Cannery Row. Those two books are easily two of my favourites. I love Steinbecks use of imagery, and his dialogue. I'm high functioning autistic so sometimes find emotions and motives hard to grasp when reading a novel, despite struggling with that I enjoy and deal well with the more abstract ideas some authors put into their works; along those lines, it's probably no surprise that I enjoy Joyce and Virginia Woolf, who are both said to have been autistic. Anyway, I'd love to have some discussions on The Grapes of Wrath. If there is any interest please say so below and we'll see if we can get something sorted. :D"
bookclub,"This is the scheduled post for Jane Eyre ch. 18-20.  Comment on this thread with your thoughts, or start a new thread if you want to focus on some particular aspect.

Next scheduled post is July 20, 2 chapters only: 21-22, or XXI-XXII as they say in Rome.

Bare-bones synopsis 

**XVIII**: Charades;  Blanche flirts with Rochester ; Jane determines Rochester is not infatuated with Ingram but plans to marry her anyway ; Rochester leaves on business ; Mr. Mason comes ; The card reading gypsy

**XIX**: Rochester reveals himself to Eyre &amp; she tells him Mason is there

**XX**: A cry in the night; Rochester calms his guests, has Jane come upstairs ; Mason wounded, Jane guards; R. returns with doc &amp; Mason's sent on his way ; R's teasing talk to Jane, concluding he'll  marry Blanche"
bookclub,"I have been searching for the answer and I haven't seen a definitive one in my hours of research. I have decided that I am going to choose between Oliver Ready's and, Pevear and Volokhonsky's translations. But some people insist that I pick David Mcduff's or Coulson translation or Michael Katz's. I am very stressed due to my indecision, ironic, and I need a conclusive answer!"
bookclub,"So I offered to do the first two discussions and I apologise for how late this one is today. I have been caught up in my job.

I couldn't help myself but read some primers to get discussions going. A lot of what I read points to empathy as a major theme in this book.

I wanted to talk about that theme and how the author is setting up that theme. I think that the most obvious way the author expresses this is directly in the first chapter. The entire chapter is practically dedicated to owning a pet. The love and care and symbiotic relationship humans have with pets is not to be down played. We have pets for little other reason now a days but for love. This really humanizes the cyborg idea and makes the characters far more relatable. The electric animals aren't good enough, robots are cold and uncaring this highlights the duality of the cyborg."
bookclub,"This post covers discussion of all of part 3, and the book as a whole. This is the final scheduled (but late!) post, but of course continue to make your own posts if you wish.    

Sorry for the delay in this everyone. I've taken over from u/inclinedtothelie for this last post but I've been really behind on my reading. But I've finished now! Who else has finished? What did you think? Was it your first reading? If not, has anything changed in your perception since last time? For those who haven't finished, are you still going? Or have you given up?     

So in part 3...     
*Winston is in the Ministry of Love, and we first hear about room 101, and that O'Brien is actually working for the Party. Were you surprised by this? Winston and Julia took a huge risk by trusting him, and it seems not to have paid off. Why do you think Winston did trust O'Brien?        
*In chapter 3, Winston is convinced that the Party will fail eventually: he says 'I don't know - I don't care. Somehow you will fail. Something will defeat you. Life will defeat you.' Do you think he's right? What would it take for the Party to be defeated?      
*In the end, Winston wins 'the victory over himself. He loved Big Brother'. What do you think of the ending? Did you expect it to end this way? Do you think it's important it ended this way?      

Some other questions:     
*What do you think about Newspeak? Do you think it is possible to establish Newspeak as the only language, as they intend eventually to do? Does language control the scope of human thought?      
*Are the means or the ends of a political agenda more important when evaluating morality?       
*For a person to be considered sane, must others share their perceptions?"
bookclub,"Hi, guys. 

I know I really fell flat on Orwell's *1984* this month. I'll just explain real quick. Basically, in January my daughter attempted to kill herself. Since then we've had multiple attempts and lots of hospital stays. Currently, we have her placed in a long-term assessment facility, so I have spent every weekend at the facility with her. 

This weekend is Canada Day long weekend and my daughter is in our home for the first time in a long time as a trial to see if she is ready to come home for good. This is the first trial of 2. So this weekend, I'm focus on her. 

As a result of all of this, I've been behind all year. I'm sorry for that. Now, I will get the schedule posted for *Electric Sheep* by Tuesday evening, PDT. My daughter will be back at her facility by then and I'll have time to recuperate and make the schedule. As for 1984, if anyone wants to post a final discussion post, I'll gladly pin it to the top to encourage others to participate, but I just don't have it in me right now. 

I hope you can understand. Thanks guys. 

TL;DR: *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep* schedule to be posted on Tuesday, July 2."
bookclub,"Here is the scheduled post for chapters 12-14.  Below, please post
observation, questions, analysis of any facet of the book.  If you've
read beyond ch 14, avoid mentioning anything that gives away coming
plot developments.

For this ""catch all"" scheduled post, anything about the book is fair
game: the meaning of a specific word; noting that you like or dislike
a specific sentence; themes; how Jane Eyre is typical of its period or
resembles other books.  If you want to create a new thread to talk
about a specific facet, that's always fine.

Ch 12: JE meets Rochester while she's on an errand and his horse falls
on ice.

Ch 13: Events of a single day: R. interviews JE,  looks at her drawings

Ch 14: Several days later; another single evening scene: R summons

bookclub,"Hey everyone! We are going to make this a little more simple. I'm not going to summarize what we've read up to this point. I want to discuss the theme of fate in this book. Throughout the text, Orwell is consistent in saying what is happening cannot be avoided. Syme's death, his meeting with O'Brien, even his affair with Julia. It goes on and on. So, what do you think about fate in this book? What do you think Orwell is trying to impress on the reader? 

Are there any other themes that are sticking out to you throughout this text? 

Looking forward to seeing your analysis!"
