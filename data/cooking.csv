,Cooking,"Maybe this is about cooking. Maybe not. Since cooking is such a personal emotional thing for many of us I'll take the risk. Let me know if this doesn't belong here.

I have said the final farewell to all of my grandparents and my parents. When they died we all sorted through their belongings and chose a few things to keep. Most of my selections were from the kitchen. My mom's mom provided a pastry blender. My dad's mom a little screen sieve. My mom provided a few items, the most special to me is a little aluminum measuring cup that she always had in the flour canister. Lots of memories came along for the ride with that measuring cup. It is now in my flour canister and I think of her every time I use it. It is still usually painful nearly three years later but I will always keep it in the canister. Tonight it was eggplant parmesan and the breading needed some flour. I both hate and cherish using it and am missing her a lot right now. I wish I could post a photo of that simple measuring cup in this text only sub; you'll just have to imagine it.

If there's a point to this post I suppose it is to encourage everyone to cherish and make time for the important things in life with people and cooking being at the top of the list.

1) Using far less water. All noodles have to be covered of course, but adding a lot more has no benefits. They won't stick together if you stir from time to time. By using less water, you get a higher concentration of starches.

2) Not salting the water for the first 5 minutes (that is, if you use normal noodles with a cooking time of about 10 min) and reserving some of the UNSALTED pasta water. 5 min are enough for the salt to penetrate the noodles, you won't taste any difference.

The biggest issue that I have though, is that the sauce isn’t creamy like traditional alfredo. Instead, it looks a bit like cottage cheese and causes the pasta to stick together a bit.
I’ve made this recipe hundreds of times, and it always turns out the same...

Is there a favorite recipe of yours that you can share with us and the rest of the community? We would love to add to the arsenal, and are always looking for new ideas! Any and all recipes are welcome as we’re not picky. 

I’ll start the discussion with a recipe we really enjoy that my father came up with. It’s amazing and I highly recommend you try it (especially if you like a bit of heat). See below for the recipe, and thanks for sharing!

Spicy Salmon Burritos

Ingredients:
1 lb Atlantic salmon (or salmon of choice)
Tortilla of choice
Jezebel spicy spice seasoning
Olive oil
Pico de Gallo:
3 Roma tomatoes
1/4 white onion
1/8 bunch cilantro
1 jalapeño de seeded
1/2 lime
Adobo sauce:
1/4 cup sour cream
7 oz can La Costena Chipotles in adobo sauce
Salt

Recipe:

1. Put sour cream in small bowl
2. Add 1/2 can sauce ONLY from La costena chipotles (add more to taste for greater heat/chipotle flavor)
3. Mix together, add salt to taste, mix again, and place in fridge.
4. Dice the Roma tomatoes, white onion, and de seeded jalapeño and place in separate bowl. Rough chop cilantro and add to bowl. Squeeze lime juice into bowl, then mix together. Add salt to taste, mix again, and place in fridge.
5. Lightly coat salmon in olive oil, and coat lightly on both sides with the jezebel spicy spice rub.
6. Grill salmon for about 5-7 mins each side on high heat per inch of thickness, or until salmon reaches internal temperature of 145F and flakes easily with a fork. If baking, preheat oven to 450F and bake for approximately 12-15 mins. 
7. Place salmon in a small bowl and break up into shreds/small pieces with a fork, ensuring that seasoning from salmon is mixed throughout.
8. Remove adobo/sour cream sauce and Pico de Gallo 
from the fridge, and heat tortillas on stove or in microwave.
9. Place tortilla on plate, add salmon, then Pico de Gallo, and adobo/sour cream sauce to finish. Wrap ingredients in tortilla.

&lt;p&gt;Is there a favorite recipe of yours that you can share with us and the rest of the community? We would love to add to the arsenal, and are always looking for new ideas! Any and all recipes are welcome as we’re not picky. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll start the discussion with a recipe we really enjoy that my father came up with. It’s amazing and I highly recommend you try it (especially if you like a bit of heat). See below for the recipe, and thanks for sharing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spicy Salmon Burritos&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ingredients:
1 lb Atlantic salmon (or salmon of choice)
Tortilla of choice
Jezebel spicy spice seasoning
Olive oil
Pico de Gallo:
3 Roma tomatoes
1/4 white onion
1/8 bunch cilantro
1 jalapeño de seeded
1/2 lime
Adobo sauce:
1/4 cup sour cream
7 oz can La Costena Chipotles in adobo sauce
Salt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recipe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put sour cream in small bowl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add 1/2 can sauce ONLY from La costena chipotles (add more to taste for greater heat/chipotle flavor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mix together, add salt to taste, mix again, and place in fridge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dice the Roma tomatoes, white onion, and de seeded jalapeño and place in separate bowl. Rough chop cilantro and add to bowl. Squeeze lime juice into bowl, then mix together. Add salt to taste, mix again, and place in fridge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lightly coat salmon in olive oil, and coat lightly on both sides with the jezebel spicy spice rub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grill salmon for about 5-7 mins each side on high heat per inch of thickness, or until salmon reaches internal temperature of 145F and flakes easily with a fork. If baking, preheat oven to 450F and bake for approximately 12-15 mins. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place salmon in a small bowl and break up into shreds/small pieces with a fork, ensuring that seasoning from salmon is mixed throughout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove adobo/sour cream sauce and Pico de Gallo 
from the fridge, and heat tortillas on stove or in microwave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place tortilla on plate, add salmon, then Pico de Gallo, and adobo/sour cream sauce to finish. Wrap ingredients in tortilla.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

,Cooking,"I feel like we get a lot of questions about what to keep on hand in your pantry/fridge so I wanted to share six of my go-to pasta sauces (plus a couple more that I don't like but maybe you will) which can all be made with 11 ingredients that are really easy to keep around. All of these recipes come together in like 20 minutes and are almost impossible to mess up.

#The Ingredients

1. **Whole peeled canned tomatoes.** The best tomatoes are generally what end up whole in the cans plus they don't have any firming agents that can keep them from cooking down nicely. imo no point in springing for San Marzano most of the time. I'd recommend Muir Glenn in the US or Mutti in Europe. Keep a few cans around always—obviously they're not going bad anytime soon.
2. **Tomato paste.** The tubes are handy if you'll be using little bits somewhat frequently. I think ATK recommends Cento for this one in the US. I use Mutti again in Europe.
3. **Garlic.** It's garlic. You know the deal. Keeps for a couple weeks at least somewhere cool and dry.
4. **Yellow onions.** Yellow onions are mildest and best for cooked applications imo, but feel free to use white or red if that's how you get your jollies. Also keeps for a couple weeks.
5. **Shallots.** Even milder than the yellow onions. In a pinch, you could use onions in all the recipes that call for shallots. Or shallots in all the recipes that call for onions if you've got that Rockefeller money *Also* keeps for a couple weeks.
6. **Lemons.** Nothing fancy needed. Just plain old lemons. If you like the zest, maybe spring for organic. They keep a week or two in the fridge.
7. **Heavy cream.** Heavy cream or heavy whipping cream both work—just make sure it's not sweetened. Generally lasts about two weeks.
8. **Parmigiano reggiano.** Get the real stuff in its whole form—no ground up shit. It can be DOP if you want but doesn't have to be. There's plenty of great parm out there that isn't DOP-certified (but none of it it sold by Kraft). I personally prefer a 24-month most of the time, but a more complex 36-month has its charms too. It'll last quite a while wrapped up in the fridge.
9. **Pecorino romano.** Another grating cheese, but quite different from parm in flavor. While parm is more about nutty umami, pecorino brings more saltiness and a hint of tang. I'm probably in the minority here, but if both cheeses were in a burning building and I could only save one, I'd save the pecorino. You *can* substitute them for each other in a pinch but, like I said, they're not all that similar.
10. **Guanciale or pancetta.** Guanciale can be challenging to find outside of Europe, but it's worth the effort to track it down. (I think you can even order it on Amazon). It's fattier, sweeter, and milder in flavor than pancetta, but pancetta is much easier to find so you can sub that if needed. You can freeze either for quite a while. Just cut into thickish slabs (roughly ¼"" or 0.5cm) and separate with wax paper then keep it in the freezer. You can cut it into lardons straight from the freezer (it's way easier that way actually) and use it without thawing.
11. **Vodka.** Alternative uses: getting you drunk. Lasts forever.

I'm also assuming that you have some real basics on hand already. Namely salt, black pepper, chili flakes, olive oil, and butter. You'll need the actual pasta too. I recommend De Cecco across the board.

#The Recipes

1. **Basic tomato sauce/arrabbiata.** (Tomatoes, garlic, parm, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). My basic quick tomato sauce is actually based on [Serious Eat's arrabbiata recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/02/penne-pasta-arrabbiata-sauce-recipe.html). If you don't like spice, you can dial the pepper back as much as you like. This works with just about any shape. Penne's a classic, but casarecce might be my fave. Also great on [homemade gnocchi](https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/03/technique-fresh-ricotta-gnocchi-fast.html).
2. **All'amatriciana.** (Tomatoes, onion, pecorino, guanciale/pancetta, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). This is hands down the king of pasta sauces in my book. The pork fat takes everything that's great about tomato sauce and turns it up to 11 with minimal added effort. I use Marcella Hazan's recipe, which you can find [here](https://cookingfrombooks.com/2014/05/12/pasta-allamatriciana-2/). The only alteration I make is I render and crisp the pork first (starting in a cold pan) and *then* add the onions. idk why Marcella never seems to brown meat. Bucatini is supposedly the classic with this, but in Italy I've seen it much more with mezze maniche and I prefer it that way. That's a tough shape to find though, so you can sub something like rigatoni.
3. **Alla gricia.** (Pecorino, guanciale, black pepper, olive oil). Alla gricia is basically the midway point between all'amatriciana and cacio e pepe. Once again, I think the pork really improves on cacio e pepe. While it's fine to sub pancetta in the last recipe, I think this one suffers a bit more from the substitution. I recommend the [Serious Eats recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2018/11/pasta-alla-gricia.html). As with all'amatriciana, mezze maniche or rigatoni is the move.
4. **Cacio e pepe.** (Pecorino, black pepper, olive oil, butter). Is it as good as alla gricia? Despite being much more well-known, I'd say no. But sometimes you can't find guanciale or just can't be assed to render it. Cacio e pepe to the rescue. Once again, [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/02/spaghetti-cacio-e-pepe-recipe.html). Keep in mind that legit pecorino is very salty, so don't oversalt the pasta water. If all pecorino is too much for you, experiment with using part parm. Spaghetti is the way to go for this one.
5. **Alla vodka.** (Tomato paste, shallot, heavy cream, parmesan, vodka, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). Somehow this sauce hits all the exact same comforting notes as boxed mac and cheese (I mean that in the best way possible). I really like the [Bon Appetit](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/fusilli-alla-vodka-basil-parmesan) recipe. Fusilli is awesome with this, but the classic penne also works.
6. **Al limone.** (Garlic, shallot, lemon, heavy cream, parm, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). A break from the tomato-y cheesy porkiness. This is one of my favorites. I use the [Cooks Illustrated recipe](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/videos/1731-spaghetti-with-lemon-and-olive-oil-al-limone) (non-video is paywalled) but add some garlic, chili flake, and a bunch more lemon juice. I skip the zest and herbage. Use spaghetti for this one.

Finally, a couple honorable mentions: you also have all the ingredients here for **aglio e olio** and **alfredo**. I don't personally like either all that much, but I know lots of people go gaga over aglio e olio especially. Try 'em out if they sound up your alley. If you keep eggs around, you could also do **carbonara.** Again, not my fave, but you do you.",t2_4uv35,False,,1,False,My love letter to pantry pastas,[],r/Cooking,False,6,,0,False,t3_ermku7,False,dark,,public,2182,4,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2182,,True,,False,,[],"{'gid_1': 2, 'gid_2': 1}",,True,,1579595502.0,text,6,,,text,self.Cooking,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel like we get a lot of questions about what to keep on hand in your pantry/fridge so I wanted to share six of my go-to pasta sauces (plus a couple more that I don&amp;#39;t like but maybe you will) which can all be made with 11 ingredients that are really easy to keep around.

* 1 lb of ground pork
* 1 cup of cabbage (not nappa) diced
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 clove or garlic (minced)
* 6 scallions (whites cut up)
* 1 tsp sesame oil
* 2 TBSP soy sauce
* 1 tsp Chinese cooking wine
* 1 package of round dumpling wrappers (about 35-45 per package)

Dipping Sauce

* 1/2 cup soy sauce
* 1/4 cup Chinese Chinkiang black vinegar
* 1 tsp ginger (cut 2 thin slices into very thin strips)

&amp;#x200B;

Chop up the cabbage and put in a big bowl and mix in the salt.  Let it sit and wilt a bit.  My mom said that this makes it softer for mixing. Let it sit while you prep the other ingredients.

Combine the ingredients for the dipping sauce.  The ginger will infuse the sauce nicely. :)

Mix pork, cabbage, garlic, scallions, sesame oil, 2 TBSP soy sauce, cooking wine in a bowl until well combined.  Make a small meat pancake and fry it in a skillet.  Taste test and adjust seasonings.

Now it's time to wrap. Use about a rounded teaspoon of filling per wrapper. (YouTube has some really good videos).

To cook the dumplings:. Add about a 1/2 TBSP canola oil to a non-stick pan. Add the dumplings, one by one into the pan...make sure to rub some of the oil in the pan onto the bottom of each dumpling.  Add about 3 TBSP of water.  Cook, covered, on med to low heat for about 7 - 9minutes.  (I usually like to use lower heat in my cooking so that I don't burn my foods.)  Check to see that the dumpling skins look steamed through.  If not steamed through, and the pan is dry, add another TBSP of water.

Once the dumplings look steamed through, take the cover off and turn up the heat a little to crips the bottoms.

Plate the dumplings on a big plate and serve with the ginger dipping sauce.

Enjoy!

,Cooking,"I was looking for a dish that would be extremely cost effective without being tasteless and decided black beans and brown rice with some seasoning would fit the bill. I referenced a recipe online for seasoning ideas, calling for 1 tsp of cumin, 1 tsp of chili powder, and 1/4 tsp of both salt and pepper to be added to 2 cups of beans just a little before they were done cooking. After the beans were done cooking, I put 2 cups of brown rice in with the beans, seasoned it the same as I had for the beans (the reference recipe I had used was only for seasoning the beans so I thought I'd add more to help the rice as well) and cooked the rice. When I went to taste it, everything was cooked perfectly fine, the beans and rice both tender, but it was incredibly bland. 

I ended up doubling the total amount of the seasonings little by little trying to get any semblance of taste out of the mix before I made a hail-Mary at fixing it and added about 1 tsp of garlic powder and 2 tsp of seasoning salt. I normally avoid using this particular seasoning salt because it seems to very easily overpower anything else it is with, but it did give the mix a fair bit of flavor and make it at least edible.

So the advice I wanted to seek out here would be

1. Is there any particular reason the cumin and chili powder would make no profile of their own in this? Far too little seasoning used? Or maybe those two seasonings just won't add any real flavor without more than rice and beans in the dish?
2. What seasonings would any of you use to get the most of simple black beans and brown rice?

And if needed for clarification, I used dried black beans I had soaked for 8 hours and rinsed before cooking and I made sure to thoroughly rinse the rice beforehand to remove starch.

,Cooking,"I just wanted to share a couple of cooking anecdotes that really made me feel good over the weekend.

Last week, my youngest daughter (who is 13) kept talking about how she wanted to make a ""healthy meal"" for the family. So, on Friday she decided on making a stir fry using [this handy info-graphic that I show to everyone who is interested in making stir-fry.](http://imgur.com/gallery/HfWH4tt) She took chicken breast, asparagus, broccoli and baby corn and stir-fried it perfectly with the orange ginger sauce recipe. Everyone (meaning my wife, her older sister and my) thought it was really good and she was very proud of herself. I only gave a couple of cooking tips during the process, but she did all the physical work.  It was a pretty great feeling.

Fast forward to Sunday evening. We'd had a big after-church meal and my wife was at her monthly book club, so we weren't going to have any sort of family dinner. At one point in the evening, I saw the leftover broccoli and asparagus in the fridge and resolved to do something with it before it went bad. So, I just put it all on a baking sheet together, hit it with some olive oil, salt and pepper and roasted it. Now, whenever I normally cook broccoli, I always just steam it. The kiddos like that and I've never roasted it before. They've had roasted asparagus before and were luke warm on it. 

When it was done, I told them about it, left it on the counter and then went into another room. I didn't really expect them to like it, but when I came back into the kitchen a little while later - the baking sheet was empty. They'd devoured it all and were asking me to make roasted broccoli again soon. It was a pretty great feeling, knowing how much they liked that - and that it was fairly healthy.

I own a nutribullet and recently learned that blenders take mason jars and you can load them up ahead of time with frozen fruits and yogurt and then have them ready to go during the week.

Unfortunately, I didn't realize that standard mouth mason jars do not fit the nutribullet.

Doubling down, I didn't learn my lesson and returned my first set of standard-mouths and then purchased a set of wide-mouth mason jars. These also do not fit the nutribullet blade top.

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any sweet tips I can use to blend in mason jars (or something equivalently priced \[and preferably glass\])  using my nutribullet? If not, should I simply get a magicbullet so that I can use mason jars for smoothie prep?

,Cooking,"So I wanted to show you how to make a classic noodle dish from Yibin in the Sichuan province – burning noodles.

Now, upon seeing the words “Sichuan” and “Burning Noodles” in the same sentence, I can probably guess where your mind’s headed. Yep, these noodles are indeed pretty spicy. But no... that’s not actually why they’re called “Burning Noodles”.

The ‘burn’ in burning noodles is a translation for the character ‘ran’ (燃) – which means to light, or to ignite (e.g. the flash point of an oil is referred to as its ‘ran dian’… literally translated, ‘ignition point’). Why ‘ignition noodles’? Well, they’re got the name because… they’re not a soup noodle dish. So much not a soup noodle dish, in fact, you could theoretically take a lighter to them and the noodles would burn in front of you (note: don’t do this, waste of noodles).

Now I know that feels like a hell of a commitment to the concept of ‘not soup noodle’. But you can find this sort of explicitly not-soup noodle dish in old trading towns up and down the middle to upper reaches of the Yangtze river:

1.	[Wuhan, Hot Dry Noodles](https://i.imgur.com/c1tKXua.png).  Wuhan is the last major city right before the three gorges area of the Yangtze river (criminally under-rated food city). One of their most iconic dishes is “hot dry noodles”… the dry referring to the fact that – again – this is not a soup noodle.

2.	[Wanzhou, Zajiang Noodles.](https://i.imgur.com/D9sQGpg.png) Up the river a bit, after the three gorges area – a proper city in its own right, though technically a ‘district’ of Chongqing today. Named so because it was historically place where “a myriad rivers converge and a myriad traders gather” (万川毕汇、万商云集) – though a good chunk of Wanzhou today lies beneath 150 meters of water in the reservoir created by the three gorges dam. One of their famous noodle dishes is called ‘Zajiang Noodle’ (not to be confused with the Northern ‘Zhajiang Noodle’), which’s some dry noodles topped with meat sauce.

3.	[Chongqing, Mala Xiaomian.](https://i.imgur.com/LfYRJYl.png) Historically the focal point of trade in the Sichuan province. Their noodle dish of choice is the fiery xiaomian (‘small noodles’). While historically these noodles were always served dry, today you can find them either dry or in soup.

4.	[Yibin, Burning Noodles.](https://i.imgur.com/7wrLyXO.png) Yibin lies at the Yangtze’s highest navigable point – at the intersection of the Yangtze and the Min river (the latter going up to Leshan – home of the Leshan Giant Buddha – and Chengdu). 

So. Why do all of these places have dry noodles? Even though these cities span three different provinces, they were all *so* influenced by the Yangtze river trade that there’s this… similarity to the cultures there that’s hard to put into words. They’ve all got this… ineffable toughness to them, and these river towns were some of the first in the country to use chili pepper extensively. Some people say that dry noodles were originally popular on the docks because, well, rocky boats aren’t exactly the best place to scarf down a soup noodle. Or perhaps it’s a climate thing. Or maybe, I dunno, they just liked their noodles sans soup for the same reason people in the West generally eat noodles dry – they just… liked them better sometimes. I dunno.

Now of course, this is one of those classic street food sort of dishes, which means its paradoxically (A) simple to serve but (B) time consuming to prep. The way I’d personally sort this logistically would be to sort all of your ingredients in advance (on the weekend or something) and toss them in the fridge. Then the remaining cook time is like… five minutes of work max, so it makes for a great quick snack or an easy dinner, that kind of thing.

So I’ll be splitting this up into three sections. First, ‘stuff to prep in advance’. Second, ‘how to make noodles’ (just in case you’re feeling a Sichuan noodle making project… any sort of alkaline noodle should work ok though). Then lastly, ‘how to make a bowl of burning noodles’. Apologies if this gets confusing – I just was wracking my brain trying to figure out the best way to organize this all so that we could all stay true to the essence of this dish (a quick meal) while still staying true to the flavor.

[Video is here if you’d like a visual to follow along](https://youtu.be/A1y-OhS9z20). I go off on the history a touch again in the beginning there, so jump in at ~ the two minute mark if you want just the recipe.

## Things to prepare in advance for Burning Noodles

Ok, so there’s either three or four things that I think would be convenient to prepare in advance:

* An Yibin-style chili oil called ‘xiangyou’.

* Toasted crushed peanuts.

* Toasted crushed sesame seeds.

* Toasted yacai – pickled and fermented mustard greens.

For those then, you’ll need:

1.	*Dried Sichuan Erjingtiao chilis (二荆条) -or- Arbols, 20g; Dried Heaven Facing Chili (朝天椒) -or- Thai Birds Eye, 10g; or sub in ~1/3 cup of a good chili powder.* So traditionally the chili oil is made with a toasted chili powder – a powder made from a mix of two parts Sichuan erjingtiao chili (a chili that’s roughly as how as cayenne and is known for its vibrant red color) and one part Heaven facing chili (a… quite spicy chili that’s related to and slightly more mild than Thai bird’s eye). Arbols or cayennes are an acceptable sub for Erjingtiao (though you could perhaps add a pinch of Korean chili powder for color if its convenient), Thai bird’s eye is a very close sub for Heaven facing (though Thai bird’s eye *is* hotter, fair warning).

2.	*Sichuan caiziyou (菜籽油) -or- Indian mustard seed oil -or- Peanut oil (花生油), 60g.* So right – like all oil-heavy dishes in the Chinese southwest, Yibin xiangyou relies on a virgin rapeseed oil called Caiziyou. It’s… really really hard to come by in the West (though there’s been some sightings in NYC, and it looks like Mala Market – an online Sichuan ingredient shop – might be getting some in soon). I bring it up not to tease you, but because it’s a foundational flavor. After testing a number of different oils, I found Indian mustard seed oil to be almost indistinguishable after heating it up… close enough to be a direct sub. That said, I know Indian mustard seed oil *also* isn’t exactly a supermarket staple in the West… so barring that, just use peanut oil. Not perfect, but should still taste good.

3.	*Lard (猪油) -or- cooked peanut oil (花生油), 60g.* So after making the chili oil, we’ll be mixing in a good chunk of melted lard. That said, this *is* one of those almost-veg dishes, so if you’re cooking for vegetarians… feel free to swap in cooked peanut oil instead. Basically just heat the peanut oil up til smoke point like we do in the recipe below, **cool it down a bit** and reserve (note: add the peanut oil at, let's say... 80C give or take). Not as authentic as lard, but should still be real nice in the dish. 

4.	*Spices/seasonings for the chili oil: 25g smashed ginger (姜), one whole walnut (带壳核桃), ½ cinnamon stick (桂皮), 2 star anise (八角), 1 tsp Sichuan peppercorn (花椒).* Yep, that one whole walnut – shell and all. Lends a nice earthiness to the chili oil… a real classic in Yibin xiangyou.

5.	 *Peanuts (生花生), 5 tbsp.* We’ll be toasting these, then crushing them. If you’d like, feel free to swap for an equal amount of roasted peanuts in order to skip the toasting process.

6.	*Sesame seeds (白芝麻), 1.5 tbsp.*  We’ll also be toasting and crushing these as well.

7.	*Yacai (芽菜), ~1/2 cup.* So right. The bane of many people in the West attempting to recreate Sichuan dishes – yacai (pickled and fermented mustard greens) is a non-negotiable must here. While not all Asian supermarkets carry it, the good ones do – and [it’s always available extremely overpriced online](https://www.amazon.com/Bin-Sui-Cai-SuiMiYaCai-Vegetable/dp/B01N7T7M4X).

Note that all of these amounts’ll be enough for 4-5 bowls of noodles. Feel free to scale these up if you’d like.

*Process: Chili oil, nuts, and yacai prep:*

Let’s just start with the chili oil because it’s the most intensive. For the chili oil:

1.	*If working from dried chilis, toast for ~5 minutes over medium-low flame.* The chilis’ll be done once they’ve deepened in color and started to smell real nice. As always with toasting chilis though, it’s safer to under toast than over toast.

2.	*Snip the chilis into 2cm sections, keeping the seeds but tossing the stems.*

3.	*Pulse for ~6 minutes in a blender until the chilis are rather fine flakes. Reserve.* You’re looking for a pretty ‘powdery’ chili flake – [something like this](https://i.imgur.com/uepeCo8.png).

4.	*Heat up your 60g of caiziyou (or mustard seed oil, or peanut oil) until it begins to smoke, ~230C. Keep it at that temperature for about 1-2 minutes, then shut off the heat.* Yeah, that’s not a typo – 230C. Heating the oil like this is a must for both Sichuan caiziyou *and* Indian mustard seed oil – doing so’ll significantly reduce the pungency of the oil. Makes peanut oil taste pretty good, too.

5.	*Let the oil cool down to 200-210C, then add in the ginger, the walnut, the Sichuan peppercorn, the cinnamon, and the star anise. Cook for ~5 minutes.* Adding this stuff’ll lower the temperature – not a problem, we’re looking for this to slowly cook at around 150C. If the temperature dips too far below 150C (likely), swap the heat back on to roughly cook at that temperature. It’s fine if it’s a bit variable, but you **do** need it to be at ~150 before the next step.

6.	*Take out some of the clunkier spices, then strain the oil into the chili flakes.* It’ll sizzle in a real satisfying way. Quick stir.

7.	*Melt the lard, then pour it in with the chili oil.* Another quick stir.

And… there you have it. Reserve that stuff, it’s good to use for the burning noodles.

As for everything else?

1.	*Toasted the peanuts over a medium flame for ~12 minutes.* Toast until the peanuts are cooked through and charred on the outside.

2.	*Rub the peanuts with your fingers, then lightly blow off the peels.* Or peel however you feels like, but blowing the peels off is a lot easier than going one by one.

3.	*Put the toasted peanuts in a bag, and light roll over them with a rolling pin or a 24oz beer bottle for ~2 minutes.* A beer bottle is super classic for this lol. Regardless, you want something [about this consistency](https://i.imgur.com/4UVdtSW.png). (Sorry for the blurry pic there)

4.	*Toast the sesame seeds over a medium-low flame for about five minutes.* Or until the sesame seeds start to darken and/or you can hear a couple popping.

5.	*In a mortar -or- with a bag/beer bottle, ever so lightly crush the sesame to get them to release their oil.* Some that [looks about like this](https://i.imgur.com/DghOB5W.png). 

6.	*Soak the yacai in cool water for ~5 minutes.* Doing this will get out their salinity.

7.	*Toast the yacai over a medium-low flame for 1-2 minutes.* Or until dry and just barely beginning to stick to the wok.

Note that we actually didn’t toast our yacai because we… prefer it untoasted. It’s a little sharper and funkier that way. The more proper way is to toast though, so… do that.

## How to Make Sichuan-style Alkaline Noodles

Ok, so again. This is not a must or anything. Want to sub in Japanese ramen noodles? Sure, go for it. But really… any noodle that has a nice bite to it should work fine. Want to use dried spaghetti? I mean… it wouldn’t be the same for sure, but it could still be tasty. Just be sure to cook al dente, and never tell a soul I said it was ok. 

But I do think it’s nice to undertake a noodle project every now and then – if only to help understand what you’re going for, and to guide more informed shopping choices in the future.

It’s also pretty easy in the grand scheme of things. And we’ll be using a pasta maker and a stand mixer to make our life even easier.

*Ingredients, Sichuan-style alkaline noodles:*

1.	*Bread flour -or- Chinese noodle flour (高筋面粉), 300g.* Basically anything with a higher gluten content – we were working with something that was 12.8% protein IIRC.

2.	*Water, 125g.* Or I guess 126 to be exact – we were going with 42% hydration. Note that this’ll make for a really dry dough… and some recipes go even drier than that (we actually saw one that was 38% hydration). 

3.	*Sodium carbonate (碱面), ½ tsp.* So yeah – that’s sodium carbonate, *not* sodium bicarbonate (i.e. baking soda). It’s a much stronger base… sporting a pH of ~11.5 to baking soda’s ~8.5. It’s readily available online, and feel free to sub in Jianshui/Kan Sui/Lye water if that’s more convenient. All of the above inconvenient? Feel free to use the baked baking soda trick – I’ll detail how in the notes below.

*Process, Sichuan style alkaline noodles:*

1.	*Dissolve the sodium carbonate in with the water.* Mix well.

2.	*Slowly add the water/sodium carbonate mixture into the flour, mixing it in bit by bit.* Especially because this’s a pretty dry dough, so doing it bit by bit helps the flour absorb the water more evenly. Aim for the dry parts when tossing in the water. I like mixing in with a single chopstick – less sticky that way.

3.	*Knead for ~8 minutes -or- use a stand mixer with the hook attachment on speed two.* Same ~8 minutes. Especially with the hook attachment, you might find the dough to still be a bit crumbly after eight minutes – no problem at all, just press and knead it together by hand until it all comes together. It’ll still be a bit craggly – no worries. 

4.	*Cover, let it rest for ~30 minutes.*

5.	*Cut the dough in half, then roll it into something that looks vaguely ‘sheet-ish’.* We’ll be working this one half at a time. Rolling it’s just to get it to squeeze into the pasta maker easier.

6.	*Flour the dough and pasta maker, then pass it through at the largest setting. Then do the same at the third smallest setting.*

7.	*Fold the dough ~four times, then slice it with a knife to make noodles.* So two choices here – machine cut or knife cut noodles. If you want your pasta maker to cut them, just uh… cut them. We’re looking for noodles that’re about 2mm wide. You can also cut them by hand too, of course – there’s something about the texture of knife cut noodles that I seem to prefer, but it’s hard to pinpoint what exactly. Either way, you want something that looks [more or less like this](https://i.imgur.com/ktSUbSr.png).

8.	*Pull apart and thoroughly flour the noodles.* Add more flour than you think you might need when flouring them – nothing’s worse than making a bunch of noodles, only to have them end up as one sticky mass.


In an ideal world, eat… soon. But I’ve found these are still quite good even 48-72 hours later too.

## Putting together our Burning Noodles

So in Yibin, in most of the noodle shops you have one of two choices: 100g of noodles (二两) or 150g of noodles (三两). We’ll be assuming a 150g bowl of noodles, mostly just because it feels a bit more substantive to me personally.

*Ingredients, one bowl of burning noodles:*

1.	*Fresh noodles, 150g.*

2.	*Yibin chili oil, 2 tbsp.* I.e. the chili oil from above.

3.	*Light soy sauce (生抽), 1 tsp.*

4.	*Toasted sesame oil, 1 tsp.* Actually most authentic here would be untoasted sesame oil (referred to as ‘white’ sesame oil – 白芝麻油). We used toasted out of laziness in sourcing mostly, but both work great.

5.	*Toasted -or- untoasted yacai (芽菜), 2 tbsp.* So yeah, we actually preferred ours untoasted here. But toasted yacai is more proper, so let that be your default choice.

6.	*Mixed toasted crushed peanuts/sesame, 2 tbsp.*

7.	*Sliced scallion greens (葱), ~2 tbsp.*

8.	*MSG (味精), ¼ tsp -or- chicken bouillon powder (鸡粉), ½ tsp.* Either way – chicken bouillon powder’s basically MSG (well actually usually a mix of disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate given how hyperbolic some Westerns are of MSG) plus some other stuff anyhow. You find see both in Yibin.  

*Process, Burning Noodles:*

Ok, quick aside on equipment. One super classic thing that you’ll see in Yibin are [these things](https://i.imgur.com/tfaiuKs.png) – basically, vendors’ll toss the noodles in after cooking and vigorously strain them in a snapping circular motion. You certainly don’t need to be that obsessive – just do a bang up job straining them. That said, if something conical like a chinois is handy, why not? Just toss the noodles in and snap strain like the vendors do. Plus, you feel all cool doing it.

You don’t want too much time in between straining and doing the initial mix with the liquid ingredients (like, ~60 seconds max), so be sure to have everything handy.

1.	*Cook the noodles until -just- past al dente, ~1 minute.* I usually just time this kind of thing by trying it and seeing what the texture’s like… it ended up being ~1 minute for the fresh alkaline noodles we made above. But don’t take my word for it – if you’re working with a package, go with the package… and even if you’re using the same fresh noodle recipe above, it’s possible that you couldn’t cut your noodles a little thinner or a little thicker. So yeah. Taste the noodles.

2.	*Thoroughly strain the noodes.* It’s really tough to describe this motion… basically you barely lift the strainer up above your shoulder, then snap it down to your waist. Do this 4-5 times and the noodles should be pretty dry. Or alternatively, strain however the hell you feel like – just make sure to move fast so they’re not clumping/sticking on you. 

3.	*Add the liquid ingredients: the chili oil, the soy sauce, the sesame oil.* Give it a thorough mix.

4.	*Top with the rest of the ingredients, then serve.* Mix it all up right before eating.

**Note on how to make sodium carbonate:**

So, why do we even use baking soda in baked goods and such? Well, for two reasons. First is that you can combine it with an acid like cream of tartar and make things puff up in the same way your elementary science fair volcano puffed up. 

Reason two? To make it decompose.

See, at temperatures above 80C, baking soda decomposes and forms (1) water vapor (well, water vapor over 100C of course…) (2) carbon dioxide and (3) sodium carbonate. That CO2 is what the gluten network in your pancakes traps, and what makes them light and airy. But you can take advantage of the same reaction to get your hands on some sodium carbonate, even if it’s not sold at your local supermarket.

Hat tip to Alex the French Guy cooking for this bit, his channel’s where I first heard of this. Just spread some baking soda out on a tray and bake it in a pre-heated oven at 150C for one hour. After that, jar it up and… there’s some sodium carbonate for you. Use it for this recipe, and basically anytime a recipe writer is telling you to use baking soda in order to raise pH (e.g. in Chinese velveting/marinades, the onion browning trick, de-sliming shrimp, etc etc). Sodium carbonate’ll be much stronger, so you’ll need a much smaller quantity, and it won’t alter the final taste of the dish like baking soda sometimes has the tendency to do.",t2_15ve8,False,,0,False,"Recipe: How to make Sichuan Burning Noodles (plus how to make alkaline noodles), 宜宾燃面",[],r/Cooking,False,6,,0,False,t3_ercib1,False,dark,,public,939,2,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,939,,True,,1579567728.0,,[],{'gid_1': 2},,True,,1579551505.0,text,6,,,text,self.Cooking,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I wanted to show you how to make a classic noodle dish from Yibin in the Sichuan province – burning noodles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘burn’ in burning noodles is a translation for the character ‘ran’ (燃) – which means to light, or to ignite (e.g. the flash point of an oil is referred to as its ‘ran dian’… literally translated, ‘ignition point’). Why ‘ignition noodles’? Well, they’re got the name because… they’re not a soup noodle dish. So much not a soup noodle dish, in fact, you could theoretically take a lighter to them and the noodles would burn in front of you (note: don’t do this, waste of noodles).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know that feels like a hell of a commitment to the concept of ‘not soup noodle’. But you can find this sort of explicitly not-soup noodle dish in old trading towns up and down the middle to upper reaches of the Yangtze river:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/c1tKXua.png""&gt;Wuhan, Hot Dry Noodles&lt;/a&gt;.  Wuhan is the last major city right before the three gorges area of the Yangtze river (criminally under-rated food city). One of their most iconic dishes is “hot dry noodles”… the dry referring to the fact that – again – this is not a soup noodle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/D9sQGpg.png""&gt;Wanzhou, Zajiang Noodles.&lt;/a&gt; Up the river a bit, after the three gorges area – a proper city in its own right, though technically a ‘district’ of Chongqing today. Named so because it was historically place where “a myriad rivers converge and a myriad traders gather” (万川毕汇、万商云集) – though a good chunk of Wanzhou today lies beneath 150 meters of water in the reservoir created by the three gorges dam. One of their famous noodle dishes is called ‘Zajiang Noodle’ (not to be confused with the Northern ‘Zhajiang Noodle’), which’s some dry noodles topped with meat sauce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/LfYRJYl.png""&gt;Chongqing, Mala Xiaomian.&lt;/a&gt; Historically the focal point of trade in the Sichuan province. Their noodle dish of choice is the fiery xiaomian (‘small noodles’). While historically these noodles were always served dry, today you can find them either dry or in soup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/7wrLyXO.png""&gt;Yibin, Burning Noodles.&lt;/a&gt; Yibin lies at the Yangtze’s highest navigable point – at the intersection of the Yangtze and the Min river (the latter going up to Leshan – home of the Leshan Giant Buddha – and Chengdu). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. Why do all of these places have dry noodles? Even though these cities span three different provinces, they were all &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; influenced by the Yangtze river trade that there’s this… similarity to the cultures there that’s hard to put into words. They’ve all got this… ineffable toughness to them, and these river towns were some of the first in the country to use chili pepper extensively. Some people say that dry noodles were originally popular on the docks because, well, rocky boats aren’t exactly the best place to scarf down a soup noodle. Or perhaps it’s a climate thing. Or maybe, I dunno, they just liked their noodles sans soup for the same reason people in the West generally eat noodles dry – they just… liked them better sometimes. I dunno.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now of course, this is one of those classic street food sort of dishes, which means its paradoxically (A) simple to serve but (B) time consuming to prep. The way I’d personally sort this logistically would be to sort all of your ingredients in advance (on the weekend or something) and toss them in the fridge. Then the remaining cook time is like… five minutes of work max, so it makes for a great quick snack or an easy dinner, that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ll be splitting this up into three sections. First, ‘stuff to prep in advance’. Second, ‘how to make noodles’ (just in case you’re feeling a Sichuan noodle making project… any sort of alkaline noodle should work ok though). Then lastly, ‘how to make a bowl of burning noodles’. Apologies if this gets confusing – I just was wracking my brain trying to figure out the best way to organize this all so that we could all stay true to the essence of this dish (a quick meal) while still staying true to the flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/A1y-OhS9z20""&gt;Video is here if you’d like a visual to follow along&lt;/a&gt;. I go off on the history a touch again in the beginning there, so jump in at ~ the two minute mark if you want just the recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Things to prepare in advance for Burning Noodles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so there’s either three or four things that I think would be convenient to prepare in advance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Yibin-style chili oil called ‘xiangyou’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toasted crushed peanuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toasted crushed sesame seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toasted yacai – pickled and fermented mustard greens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those then, you’ll need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dried Sichuan Erjingtiao chilis (二荆条) -or- Arbols, 20g; Dried Heaven Facing Chili (朝天椒) -or- Thai Birds Eye, 10g; or sub in ~1/3 cup of a good chili powder.&lt;/em&gt; So traditionally the chili oil is made with a toasted chili powder – a powder made from a mix of two parts Sichuan erjingtiao chili (a chili that’s roughly as how as cayenne and is known for its vibrant red color) and one part Heaven facing chili (a… quite spicy chili that’s related to and slightly more mild than Thai bird’s eye). Arbols or cayennes are an acceptable sub for Erjingtiao (though you could perhaps add a pinch of Korean chili powder for color if its convenient), Thai bird’s eye is a very close sub for Heaven facing (though Thai bird’s eye &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; hotter, fair warning).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sichuan caiziyou (菜籽油) -or- Indian mustard seed oil -or- Peanut oil (花生油), 60g.&lt;/em&gt; So right – like all oil-heavy dishes in the Chinese southwest, Yibin xiangyou relies on a virgin rapeseed oil called Caiziyou. It’s… really really hard to come by in the West (though there’s been some sightings in NYC, and it looks like Mala Market – an online Sichuan ingredient shop – might be getting some in soon). I bring it up not to tease you, but because it’s a foundational flavor. After testing a number of different oils, I found Indian mustard seed oil to be almost indistinguishable after heating it up… close enough to be a direct sub. That said, I know Indian mustard seed oil &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; isn’t exactly a supermarket staple in the West… so barring that, just use peanut oil. Not perfect, but should still taste good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lard (猪油) -or- cooked peanut oil (花生油), 60g.&lt;/em&gt; So after making the chili oil, we’ll be mixing in a good chunk of melted lard. That said, this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; one of those almost-veg dishes, so if you’re cooking for vegetarians… feel free to swap in cooked peanut oil instead. Basically just heat the peanut oil up til smoke point like we do in the recipe below, &lt;strong&gt;cool it down a bit&lt;/strong&gt; and reserve (note: add the peanut oil at, let&amp;#39;s say... 80C give or take). Not as authentic as lard, but should still be real nice in the dish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spices/seasonings for the chili oil: 25g smashed ginger (姜), one whole walnut (带壳核桃), ½ cinnamon stick (桂皮), 2 star anise (八角), 1 tsp Sichuan peppercorn (花椒).&lt;/em&gt; Yep, that one whole walnut – shell and all. Lends a nice earthiness to the chili oil… a real classic in Yibin xiangyou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peanuts (生花生), 5 tbsp.&lt;/em&gt; We’ll be toasting these, then crushing them. If you’d like, feel free to swap for an equal amount of roasted peanuts in order to skip the toasting process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sesame seeds (白芝麻), 1.5 tbsp.&lt;/em&gt;  We’ll also be toasting and crushing these as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yacai (芽菜), ~1/2 cup.&lt;/em&gt; So right. The bane of many people in the West attempting to recreate Sichuan dishes – yacai (pickled and fermented mustard greens) is a non-negotiable must here. While not all Asian supermarkets carry it, the good ones do – and &lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Bin-Sui-Cai-SuiMiYaCai-Vegetable/dp/B01N7T7M4X""&gt;it’s always available extremely overpriced online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that all of these amounts’ll be enough for 4-5 bowls of noodles. Feel free to scale these up if you’d like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Process: Chili oil, nuts, and yacai prep:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s just start with the chili oil because it’s the most intensive. For the chili oil:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If working from dried chilis, toast for ~5 minutes over medium-low flame.&lt;/em&gt; The chilis’ll be done once they’ve deepened in color and started to smell real nice. As always with toasting chilis though, it’s safer to under toast than over toast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Snip the chilis into 2cm sections, keeping the seeds but tossing the stems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pulse for ~6 minutes in a blender until the chilis are rather fine flakes. Reserve.&lt;/em&gt; You’re looking for a pretty ‘powdery’ chili flake – &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/uepeCo8.png""&gt;something like this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heat up your 60g of caiziyou (or mustard seed oil, or peanut oil) until it begins to smoke, ~230C. Keep it at that temperature for about 1-2 minutes, then shut off the heat.&lt;/em&gt; Yeah, that’s not a typo – 230C. Heating the oil like this is a must for both Sichuan caiziyou &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Indian mustard seed oil – doing so’ll significantly reduce the pungency of the oil. Makes peanut oil taste pretty good, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let the oil cool down to 200-210C, then add in the ginger, the walnut, the Sichuan peppercorn, the cinnamon, and the star anise. Cook for ~5 minutes.&lt;/em&gt; Adding this stuff’ll lower the temperature – not a problem, we’re looking for this to slowly cook at around 150C. If the temperature dips too far below 150C (likely), swap the heat back on to roughly cook at that temperature. It’s fine if it’s a bit variable, but you &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; need it to be at ~150 before the next step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take out some of the clunkier spices, then strain the oil into the chili flakes.&lt;/em&gt; It’ll sizzle in a real satisfying way. Quick stir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Melt the lard, then pour it in with the chili oil.&lt;/em&gt; Another quick stir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And… there you have it. Reserve that stuff, it’s good to use for the burning noodles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for everything else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toasted the peanuts over a medium flame for ~12 minutes.&lt;/em&gt; Toast until the peanuts are cooked through and charred on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rub the peanuts with your fingers, then lightly blow off the peels.&lt;/em&gt; Or peel however you feels like, but blowing the peels off is a lot easier than going one by one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Put the toasted peanuts in a bag, and light roll over them with a rolling pin or a 24oz beer bottle for ~2 minutes.&lt;/em&gt; A beer bottle is super classic for this lol. Regardless, you want something &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/4UVdtSW.png""&gt;about this consistency&lt;/a&gt;. (Sorry for the blurry pic there)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toast the sesame seeds over a medium-low flame for about five minutes.&lt;/em&gt; Or until the sesame seeds start to darken and/or you can hear a couple popping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a mortar -or- with a bag/beer bottle, ever so lightly crush the sesame to get them to release their oil.&lt;/em&gt; Some that &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/DghOB5W.png""&gt;looks about like this&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soak the yacai in cool water for ~5 minutes.&lt;/em&gt; Doing this will get out their salinity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toast the yacai over a medium-low flame for 1-2 minutes.&lt;/em&gt; Or until dry and just barely beginning to stick to the wok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that we actually didn’t toast our yacai because we… prefer it untoasted. It’s a little sharper and funkier that way. The more proper way is to toast though, so… do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to Make Sichuan-style Alkaline Noodles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so again. This is not a must or anything. Want to sub in Japanese ramen noodles? Sure, go for it. But really… any noodle that has a nice bite to it should work fine. Want to use dried spaghetti? I mean… it wouldn’t be the same for sure, but it could still be tasty. Just be sure to cook al dente, and never tell a soul I said it was ok. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do think it’s nice to undertake a noodle project every now and then – if only to help understand what you’re going for, and to guide more informed shopping choices in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also pretty easy in the grand scheme of things. And we’ll be using a pasta maker and a stand mixer to make our life even easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ingredients, Sichuan-style alkaline noodles:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bread flour -or- Chinese noodle flour (高筋面粉), 300g.&lt;/em&gt; Basically anything with a higher gluten content – we were working with something that was 12.8% protein IIRC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Water, 125g.&lt;/em&gt; Or I guess 126 to be exact – we were going with 42% hydration. Note that this’ll make for a really dry dough… and some recipes go even drier than that (we actually saw one that was 38% hydration). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sodium carbonate (碱面), ½ tsp.&lt;/em&gt; So yeah – that’s sodium carbonate, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; sodium bicarbonate (i.e. baking soda). It’s a much stronger base… sporting a pH of ~11.5 to baking soda’s ~8.5. It’s readily available online, and feel free to sub in Jianshui/Kan Sui/Lye water if that’s more convenient. All of the above inconvenient? Feel free to use the baked baking soda trick – I’ll detail how in the notes below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Process, Sichuan style alkaline noodles:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dissolve the sodium carbonate in with the water.&lt;/em&gt; Mix well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slowly add the water/sodium carbonate mixture into the flour, mixing it in bit by bit.&lt;/em&gt; Especially because this’s a pretty dry dough, so doing it bit by bit helps the flour absorb the water more evenly. Aim for the dry parts when tossing in the water. I like mixing in with a single chopstick – less sticky that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knead for ~8 minutes -or- use a stand mixer with the hook attachment on speed two.&lt;/em&gt; Same ~8 minutes. Especially with the hook attachment, you might find the dough to still be a bit crumbly after eight minutes – no problem at all, just press and knead it together by hand until it all comes together. It’ll still be a bit craggly – no worries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cover, let it rest for ~30 minutes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cut the dough in half, then roll it into something that looks vaguely ‘sheet-ish’.&lt;/em&gt; We’ll be working this one half at a time. Rolling it’s just to get it to squeeze into the pasta maker easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flour the dough and pasta maker, then pass it through at the largest setting. Then do the same at the third smallest setting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fold the dough ~four times, then slice it with a knife to make noodles.&lt;/em&gt; So two choices here – machine cut or knife cut noodles. If you want your pasta maker to cut them, just uh… cut them. We’re looking for noodles that’re about 2mm wide. You can also cut them by hand too, of course – there’s something about the texture of knife cut noodles that I seem to prefer, but it’s hard to pinpoint what exactly. Either way, you want something that looks &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/ktSUbSr.png""&gt;more or less like this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pull apart and thoroughly flour the noodles.&lt;/em&gt; Add more flour than you think you might need when flouring them – nothing’s worse than making a bunch of noodles, only to have them end up as one sticky mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, eat… soon. But I’ve found these are still quite good even 48-72 hours later too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Putting together our Burning Noodles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in Yibin, in most of the noodle shops you have one of two choices: 100g of noodles (二两) or 150g of noodles (三两). We’ll be assuming a 150g bowl of noodles, mostly just because it feels a bit more substantive to me personally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ingredients, one bowl of burning noodles:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fresh noodles, 150g.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yibin chili oil, 2 tbsp.&lt;/em&gt; I.e. the chili oil from above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Light soy sauce (生抽), 1 tsp.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toasted sesame oil, 1 tsp.&lt;/em&gt; Actually most authentic here would be untoasted sesame oil (referred to as ‘white’ sesame oil – 白芝麻油). We used toasted out of laziness in sourcing mostly, but both work great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toasted -or- untoasted yacai (芽菜), 2 tbsp.&lt;/em&gt; So yeah, we actually preferred ours untoasted here. But toasted yacai is more proper, so let that be your default choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mixed toasted crushed peanuts/sesame, 2 tbsp.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sliced scallion greens (葱), ~2 tbsp.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MSG (味精), ¼ tsp -or- chicken bouillon powder (鸡粉), ½ tsp.&lt;/em&gt; Either way – chicken bouillon powder’s basically MSG (well actually usually a mix of disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate given how hyperbolic some Westerns are of MSG) plus some other stuff anyhow. You find see both in Yibin.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Process, Burning Noodles:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, quick aside on equipment. One super classic thing that you’ll see in Yibin are &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/tfaiuKs.png""&gt;these things&lt;/a&gt; – basically, vendors’ll toss the noodles in after cooking and vigorously strain them in a snapping circular motion. You certainly don’t need to be that obsessive – just do a bang up job straining them. That said, if something conical like a chinois is handy, why not? Just toss the noodles in and snap strain like the vendors do. Plus, you feel all cool doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t want too much time in between straining and doing the initial mix with the liquid ingredients (like, ~60 seconds max), so be sure to have everything handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cook the noodles until -just- past al dente, ~1 minute.&lt;/em&gt; I usually just time this kind of thing by trying it and seeing what the texture’s like… it ended up being ~1 minute for the fresh alkaline noodles we made above. But don’t take my word for it – if you’re working with a package, go with the package… and even if you’re using the same fresh noodle recipe above, it’s possible that you couldn’t cut your noodles a little thinner or a little thicker. So yeah. Taste the noodles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thoroughly strain the noodes.&lt;/em&gt; It’s really tough to describe this motion… basically you barely lift the strainer up above your shoulder, then snap it down to your waist. Do this 4-5 times and the noodles should be pretty dry. Or alternatively, strain however the hell you feel like – just make sure to move fast so they’re not clumping/sticking on you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Add the liquid ingredients: the chili oil, the soy sauce, the sesame oil.&lt;/em&gt; Give it a thorough mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Top with the rest of the ingredients, then serve.&lt;/em&gt; Mix it all up right before eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note on how to make sodium carbonate:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why do we even use baking soda in baked goods and such? Well, for two reasons. First is that you can combine it with an acid like cream of tartar and make things puff up in the same way your elementary science fair volcano puffed up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reason two? To make it decompose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, at temperatures above 80C, baking soda decomposes and forms (1) water vapor (well, water vapor over 100C of course…) (2) carbon dioxide and (3) sodium carbonate. That CO2 is what the gluten network in your pancakes traps, and what makes them light and airy. But you can take advantage of the same reaction to get your hands on some sodium carbonate, even if it’s not sold at your local supermarket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hat tip to Alex the French Guy cooking for this bit, his channel’s where I first heard of this. Just spread some baking soda out on a tray and bake it in a pre-heated oven at 150C for one hour. After that, jar it up and… there’s some sodium carbonate for you. Use it for this recipe, and basically anytime a recipe writer is telling you to use baking soda in order to raise pH (e.g. in Chinese velveting/marinades, the onion browning trick, de-sliming shrimp, etc etc). Sodium carbonate’ll be much stronger, so you’ll need a much smaller quantity, and it won’t alter the final taste of the dish like baking soda sometimes has the tendency to do.&lt;/p&gt;

,Cooking,"After Pepperplate, in the last few days, decided to charge $3/month with no visible improvements I came here looking for a replacement.

Going through older posts I came across  u/julianpoy 's own recipe wonder called  [https://recipesage.com](https://recipesage.com/) and I gotta tell you, so far it is a great site/app.

Works well on desktop (Windows).  

Just downloaded the app (is it an app?) on Android and it works well also.

The transfer of my recipes from Pepperplate worked fine.  It took a few minutes (127 recipes).   

The *Scale Recipe* feature is great.  Same with the *select multiple recipes at once* feature (Put it to the test as for some reason it imported my recipes twice, possibly something I did, but it was easy to delete the doubles with this feature).

Made a change to a recipe in the phone app and the desktop version showed the updated recipe when I logged in.  

There is no fuss or ads.  It is simple and really, what else do you need?

I am excited to see how well this works for me on the next few weeks/months of using it, but my first impression is a 5/5.

,Cooking,"[Here's the finished product!](https://imgur.com/KW8nMPF) I made the pasta from scratch with my new pasta roller. It was a lot of fun!

[This is the recipe I used.](https://www.prouditaliancook.com/2019/11/four-cheese-ravioli-with-herb-embedded-pasta.html?m) I pretty much followed the recipe for everything, except I added the zest of one meyer lemon, which helped cut through the richness of all the cheese. 

This recipe didn't include a topping, but I went with a classic and simple [brown butter.](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/how-to-brown-butter/) 

For the topping, I toasted up some pine nuts and gave them a rough chop. I had plenty of parsley and sage left over from the dough, so I minced those very finely. I sprinkled both on top, then added some more lemon zest and parmesan.  

This came out so, so good! For me, it was worth the effort. Once I made the dough, everything else was pretty quick to come together.

Soon I will be making a red wine reduction jus that I've made before and have  a question about the prior meat (steak) preparation. 

Noticeably the meat itself comes secondary to the Au jus in flavour. While this is completely okay as it is still delicious, I've been wondering if there were any complimenting pre-marinades I could pair with the flavour profile of the Au jus. 

It's not crucial of course but if anyone has any tips or personal experiences that they have paired to perfection I would love to know.

To note the main flavour profiles of the reduction are:

1. Red wine
2. Shallots
3. Balsamic

After my grandfather died, I asked my mother and her siblings for the recipe. None of them had it, but my mother had her own version that tasted exactly like my grandfather’s. However, my mom made the soup from canned and frozen ingredients.  

I have tried many, many different recipes for oyster artichoke soup, but none of them come close to this one. I would really rather make it from scratch, like my grandfather did, but I don’t have the recipe.  

My mom’s recipe follows. If any of you good folks have suggestions as to how I could deconstruct and recreate my grandfather’s recipe from this one, I’d really appreciate the help!  

&gt; 
&gt; **Oyster Artichoke Soup**  
&gt; *Ingredients:*
&gt; 
&gt; * 2 pints oysters with juice
&gt; * 5 cans artichoke quarters (remove tough parts)
&gt; * 2 bags frozen chopped onions, celery and peppers
&gt; * 4 tbsp flour
&gt; * 4 tbsp butter
&gt; * 2 cans condensed mushroom soup
&gt; * 2 cans condensed celery soup
&gt; * 2 cans condensed cheddar cheese soup
&gt; * 2 cans mushrooms, stems and pieces
&gt; 
&gt; *Directions*  
&gt; Heat the butter in a large, heavy-bottom pot. Add the flour and stir to make a blond roux. Add vegetables and cook until wilted. Add artichokes and mushrooms. Cook for about 15 minutes. Add all soups and heat through. Do not allow to come to a boil. If the mixture is too thick, add cream or half and half, a little at a time. Do not add milk, as it will curdle. Add oysters and their liquor. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve.  

FWIW, the beginning steps - making a roux and cooking the trinity (onions, celery, peppers) - are classic starting steps for many Creole dishes. I think the issue comes in with the canned soups.

,Cooking,"I'm sitting here eating a really really good bowl of ramen.  It's so good.  And it reminds me of a conversation I had with a friend of mine some time ago where we both agreed that learning how to cook has been one of the greatest benefits in our respective lives.  Being able to put ingredients together and turn out something that you like, and maybe even other people like, is simply *joy.*  Not being limited to what restaurants you can find is *freedom* and I am so so grateful for having learned this skill.

If I could thank people, I'd have to thank just a whole host of chefs who have had cooking shows that I have devoured relentlessly for decades.  The first cooking show I ever remember watching as a kid was [The Frugal Gourmet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfigPIvycCc) (Jeff Smith) on PBS.  After that Food Network took off and I definitely ate up Emeril, Alton Brown, Mario Batali and others.  On the internet I continue to follow Chef John at Food Wishes,  Adam Ragusea, Alex at French Guy Cooking and all the wonderful folks over at the Bon Apetit Test Kitchen.  Without all of these inspirations in my life, I'd still be eating macaroni and cheese out of a box probably.

Anyway, if you're unsure, just starting out, have no idea what you're doing or are afraid of 'screwing up' in the kitchen, I have to say: just do it.  Just keep cooking, screw things up, learn from your mistakes.  It's so rewarding in the end, I promise.

As for my ramen, this is what I do to make it fantastic:

1) Throw away that stupid packet of 'flavor' they put in there.  It's worthless.  Get yourself some Better Than Bullion in whatever flavor you like (there are several).  It's infinitely superior.

2)  Sear off some chicken breasts and finish them in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes or so.

3) stir fry some veggies and just put them in a bowl to wait for now.  I use carrots, broccoli and onions.

4) On top of those veggies in that bowl, put the following: soy sauce (amount to taste), sriracha (ditto), fresh garlic, and freshly grated ginger.  All of this can sit for a few minutes marinating it's fine.

5) Use the pasta water to dissolve the bullion and just dump all of that over your noodles and veggies.  The broth will form instantly and take on a deep, rich color and you'll be able to smell that ginger throughout the house.  It's wonderful.

6) Top with chicken breasts, cut on the bias.  Finish with some cilantro or scallion or even a couple soft boiled eggs if you want.

Obviously this isn't a complicated recipe or particularly inventive, but it's just great and something I would never have dreamed of doing before I really got into cooking.

I went hunting with a buddy this weekend and shot a snow goose, and decided to just throw a brunch skillet together. It came out WAY better than I expected and I wanted to share with y'all. Detailed recipe below, but first, Imgur link to the finished tastiness:

https://imgur.com/gallery/QP1bq0k

Okay so recipe-ish. I don't cook with specific measurements all the time, I just kind of feel it out most of the time.

1) The night before your brunch, clean your goose breast fillets (I just used one for this one shared meal). Combine goose breasts in a plastic bag with 1/3 measure each of: Sriracha, Worcestershire sauce, and Sweet Chili Sauce (I used Frank's Kickin' Garlic Sauce in a substitution), where the marinade mixture just covers the goose in the bag. Cool and let it marinate over night (you don't have to do it overnight, just give it an hour or more if you're in a hurry).

2) Half-ish of a bag of frozen breakfast hasbrowns (the shredded kind). I cooked those in the vegetable oil the bag suggested, and added some pepper and garlic seasoning after they'd cooked a bit and I was stirring for the first time. Finish them and set them to the side.

3) Heat a cast iron skillet with a small amount (maybe 2TBSP tops) of Grapeseed Oil on high, until just before your oil smokes. Sear your goose breast to preference. I like my wild game cooked to rare/medium rare if it's able to be safely consumed that way, so I really just did 2.5 minutes on each side, and left it in the hot skillet while I tidied my workspace a bit. I discarded the used marinade, but if you wanted you could heat it up on the stove to a boil and reduce it to make a nice spicy glaze during this time.

4) Remove your goose breast from the skillet, put it on a cutting board to rest. Add the hash brown potatoes to the cast iron and use a spoon or spatula to stir them in the leftover stuck on stuff, oil, and juices from your searing.

5) In a separate pan, put about 2TBSP of butter to melt on medium, then fry two eggs over easy, adding a small amount of pepper and garlic powder, to taste.

6) Slice your goose to preferred thickness, lay it on the potatoes, add your eggs, and drizzle either your glaze you chose to make or sprinkle Cholula on top.

It came out way better than expected, and my buddy actually commented that ""I would never be disappointed if a fancy brunch place brought this meal to me."" 

I love wild game and this recipe actually offered very little of the game-y taste I expected, probably because of the overnight marinade. If you have any tips to offer to make it better or enhance this meal, please let me know! Thanks!

1 cup Panko

,Cooking,"This is something that is used constantly in professional kitchens but I never really see used in home kitchens (at least in the West). It is incredibly easy to make and store, and will absolutely transform your sauteeing/high heat cooking. 


To make it, simply add butter to a sauce pan- the size depends on how much clarified butter you want to make. I wouldn't do anything less than a pound, but I recommend you do a couple pounds - it lasts longer than whole butter because of the lack of milk solids so it won't go bad. Melt the butter down, and using a spoon, ladle off the white solids. You could either pour the butter through a fine mesh sieve with some cheese cloth to separate the butter from the solids at the bottom, or you can just ladle the butter out carefully (I recommend doing this).


To take it a step further and make ghee, simply cook the butter longer until the milk solids start to brown and the butter smells slightly nutty, and then strain.


The biggest advantage to using clarified butter is it's smoke point. It has a smoke point of around 450F (232C), which is around the same as corn and peanut oil, is higher than canola oil (400F, 205C), and much higher than extra virgin olive oil (330F, 166C) and whole butter (350F, 176C) This means you can get your pan hotter, allowing you to get harder sears on your food.


Another advantage, obviously, is flavor. I'm sure I dont need to tell you that butter tastes amazing, and is much preferable to vegetable/canola oil. You can use it exactly how you would use any other cooking oil, but some suggestions:


-Sauteeing veggies


-Eggs - great for getting a crispy over easy egg


-Use it for searing meats


-Poach shrimp in it


-Making hollandaise. If anyone is interested in an awesome hollandaise recipe, just let me know. It's the one I was taught at my culinary school and developed by the CIA. This post is long enough as it is, though, so I don't want to make it any longer.

,Cooking,"For those who have cast iron grates on their stove top gas range, how do you care for them?

I ask because I have a oven/range that is only about 6 months old, and I am seeing what looks to be wearing down of the black seasoning (?) or top layer on the grates. In parts of the grate, the black color looks to be wearing off and exposing a silver layer of the grate. I think this comes from shifting pots and pans on top of the surface.

Should I be seasoning these grates like I do my cast iron pans?  If so, how should I go about that?  I should note that the grates have some little rubber feet on them so they lay softly on the surface of the range.  So I think putting them in the oven is out of the question.

Any help is appreciated!

,Cooking,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

This question is kinda of embarassing, but here it goes.

As for the context, I am 19 year old and decided that it'd really be time to pick up cooking, but I'm not really sure on where to start.

I still live at my mom's house as I'm still in school, and there's no real benefit of me moving out since it's fairly close to where my mom lives, and because of this reason I've pretty much relied on my mom's cooking until now. 

For school, I'll have to do an intern for \~4 months straight, which will be in a foreign country. This will start in late august, however, I have never really cooked apart from some eggs and simple pasta. I talked about it with my mom and she said that I could start cooking a bit for myself, and that she'd be there while I cooked to help me out and what not, but I had to come up with a list of dishes I'd like to be able to cook and whatnot.

The intern will be in Hungary, and I currently live in the Netherlands, if this matters for some reason regarding the recommendations.

&amp;#x200B;

The question here would be; Do you guys have any dishes you'd recommend starting with, and possibly even some receipts I could follow which aren't too hard to start out with?",t2_konrphl,False,,0,False,"I'd like to start cooking, but I'm not sure on where to start",[],r/Cooking,False,6,,0,False,t3_erhfv3,False,dark,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1579574350.0,text,6,,,text,self.Cooking,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

When i make my own version of kung pao chicken, I cut chicken breasts and make a marinade with soy sauce, mirim (or another acidic solution), and spices, garlic ginger and so on, nothing special, is in almost every Asian recipe and the target is to add flavor to the chicken.

After I cook it, another thing happens, it's like magic, the texture changes, and this new texture is an absolute miracle. I don't know how to describe, its more gummy, smooth, cant sense the fibers in the meat.

And my doubt always is why? why does this happens? is the soy sauce? the chilling? the rehidratation of the meat? the acidic ingredients on the marinade? or the sudden change of temperature when I throw it on the flaming hot wok?

And then, a couple days ago, I saw a video where i learned a technique called **brine** first time i ear about it (its not popular here in Argentina) they drown the chicken in salty water overnight, apparently by osmosis an interchange of fluids happens and the chicken gets more salty and less dry when you cook it on the even, french technique i guess.

I couldn't tell you the last time I roasted a whole bird, as I've always felt like it didn't turn out well, like I always overcooked it. But spatchcocking is a game changer. This was literally the best roast chicken I've ever done, and the breast meat was so incredibly moist. Holy crap! And it was so easy!

Preheat oven to 425, line a sheet pan with parchment.

Halve small golden potatoes, slice onions and carrots (I didn't have carrots last night but will the next time), toss with a little olive oil  and salt and pepper and add to sheet pan in a single layer.  You could also add garlic and fresh herbs to the veg.

Flip the bird over and, using kitchen shears, cut along both sides of the spine to remove it.  Then, using a sharp knife, score the breast bone.  Place bird breast side up on top of the veg and press down on the breast bone until it breaks to flatten everything out. 

Brush skin with olive oil and season with salt and pepper and put in the middle rack of the oven. Cook for 45 minute and then check doneness with an instant read thermometer in the breast/thigh, sticking it back in for a few minutes if it's not 165.

,Cooking,"So I had a dish [similar to this](https://tasteofmaroc.com/moroccan-couscous-with-seven-vegetables/) at a Moroccan restaurant (it was vegetarian) and it was absolutely delicious. While I'm not vegetarian persay, I'm trying to get more plants in my diet and limiting my meat consumption to when I eat out. This dish is just so colorful and packed with veggies, it's absolutely awesome.

I'm also pretty new to cooking (I'm aware that this is a little ambitious for a novice cook, but I figure I'll learn either way), and I'm also trying to up my protein intake because I'm trying to build muscle (at 6'3 and 180 lbs, I need a lot). Bodybuilding and tasty, hearty meals aren't usually synonymous (I don't want to eat chicken and steamed broccoli for the rest of my life lol)

So while the recipe does offer a vegetarian version, I want to up the protein. So I was thinking about maybe using tofu (since it basically takes on the flavor of whatever it's cooked in) or maybe seitan. But I'm not sure how that would go, I probably can't cook the tofu the same way she cooks the meat or it'd probably fall apart, correct?

I have wanted to put Beyond ground ""beef"" to the test with Bolognese sauce for a long time, and yesterday I decided to do it. On the blog/recipe sphere, I see a lot of vegetarian and vegan adaptations of Bolognese and the vast majority tend to go off the rails with unnecessary ingredients (well, less unnecessary if vegan) and preparation methods. The question I wanted to answer was, ""Can a classic Bolognese recipe taste comparable when swapped with plant-based meat?""

The very short answer is yes, and I'm sure it would be fine if the *only* adjustment you made was swapping the meat. However - there are two main problems I notice when cooking with plant based ground beef: fat rendering and rich flavor. If you ever scan the back of a Beyond Beef package, the macronutrient composition is almost identical to 80/20 ground beef. Texturally, the stuff definitely holds up. 

To compensate for the fat rendering (or lack thereof) as well as rich flavor I made three adjustments to Marcella's recipe:

* One clove of garlic, very finely minced, added at the end of soffritto sweating. This decision was less about adding garlic to the overall flavor profile than intensifying the other flavors in the dish, which I find garlic does very well in small quantities.

* When sauteeing the Beyond beef, I added three tbsp of tomato paste. If you've ever eaten Beyond beef, it has a faint coconut flavor. Adding tomato early, especially paste, was an attempt to block that flavor note from overpowering the more delicate soffritto, as well as adding some of that glutamate goodness early. Also - I found the tomato paste helped make the soffritto and beef juicier as it broke down in the pot, potentially compensating for some of the loss of fat rendering.

* Speaking of glutamates, I added one medium sized parmesan rind with the 1 1/2 cup of tomatoes just before simmering. I know some new age Bolognese recipes call for fish sauce (Kenji) and other umami boosters, but I wanted to preserve Marcella's recipe as carefully as possible. That meant not just throwing in any flavor enhancer I could think of. 

I served with penne because I didn't have any tagliatelle, so you could say that alone made this a bastardized ragù ;) 

Overall - a delicious meal, served alongside a simple mâche green salad dressed with a lemon vinaigrette to cut through some of the sauce's richness. I'd recommend this plant-based adaptation for anyone looking to experiment with some classics while reducing their carbon footprint.

Quick backstory - for the past couple of years i've been going to this place and have never figured out what kind of black magic they do to make their rice so amazing. A couple of months back i finally grabbed one of the nutritional booklet things, hoping it might tell me what they use - the only ingredients are rice, salt and butter. The rice has this almost sweet and sour taste, i really cant describe it, so i thought that it might come down to the type of rice they use. So i started buying every pack of rice in the store and going through all of them, playing around with butter amounts etc, but still havent been able to nail it down.  


So thats why i've come here, can one of you tell me what type of rice it is? Theres still a couple varities i havent tried that look like good contenders, for example, i havent tried Jasmine rice yet, so im thinking of trying that next. Thanks in advance!

,Cooking,"Not a true fuck up, but I caused myself 3 hours of angst.

We got the meat grinder attachment over the holidays this year. First use was about 2 weeks ago and we made DELICIOUS breakfast sausage from a boneless pork shoulder. Everything worked perfectly! So, today I thought I’d try round 2 with a bone-in pork blade roast that was on sale.

I debone the roast, reassemble and chill the grinder, and everything’s great until I put in the first piece of meat. The meat was grinding, but nothing was coming out. I take apart the grinder and pull off giant pieces of fascia and sinew. Retry- same thing. About 1/2 an inch of meat grinds out before it gunks up with sinew and fascia. Of course, my first troubleshooting source is google, which tells me to freeze the meat and try to remove as much fascia and sinew as I can. I do that, and rechill the meat.   

Round 2 -same result. Now I’m doubting the quality of the roast. Maybe there’s too much sinew?? Convinced it must be the meat, I go buy the same whole boneless shoulder we used the last time. 3rd try and almost 3 hours later, still no meat coming out! Now I’m freaking out because there’s no way the machine would break after just one use!   

Luckily, at this point the husband comes home and before I’m even done telling him my tragic story, he asks me if I made sure to put in all the pieces. Lightbulb moment. I scramble for the manual and lo and behold, I forgot to put in the GRINDING BLADE. Cue massive facepalm, and now I’m stuck with over 20lbs of pork for two people.

TL;DR I forgot to put in a key component of the grinding attachment and thought it was an issue with the quality of the pork so I bought more pork. Now I have 20lbs of pork. Send help. (Or you know, recipes)

,Cooking,"Hello there Reddit!

I just made my first batch of pizza dough from scratch, and honestly it sucks. I was hoping that some of you guys might be able to address some of the issues I encountered with my dough.

Firstly, it was wet. Really wet. When I mixed everything together as suggested by the recipe, it looked more like pancake batter than pizza dough. I added more flour to try and improve it but it doesn't appear to have done much. 

Secondly, it had absolutely no stretch or elasticity. I did knead it how the recipe suggested, but due to the wetness I mentioned above it kept sticking to everything and it didn't really appear to be making any difference.

Lastly, once I cooked it, the resulting pizza is super soft and floppy. None of that nice crispiness  on the bottom or crunchiness in the crust. It also tears immediately when I go to pick it up.

,Cooking,"Last night, my husband and I tried to make a delicious pot pie out of one of our new cookbooks. We got some pie weights as a Christmas gift that are loose ceramic beads and decided to try them out for our crust.

He had premade a gorgeous cream cheese pie crust that he was so excited to use, and in our excitement, we dumped the weights right into the pie crust before noticing a fine dust all over the beads. After some internet research, we determined it was ceramic dust which is absolutely not safe to ingest and impossible to remove from sticky dough.

Crust #1 down.

After wallowing in self pity for a few minutes at our stupidity and failed crust, he informs me that he actually made a second crust to save for a later date that we can use now. We throw the first one out, wash the dust off the beads and dry them. We roll out the second crust, drop the weights in, and bake for ten minutes. When we remove the crust to pull the beads out, we realized they had all sunk straight into the crust and were now a big gooey mess that we were unable to remove without tearing it to bits, and our second pie crust was ruined.

Crust #2 down.

At this point, we have a frozen crust in the freezer we decide we have to use since we ran out of ingredients for the fresh crust. The instructions for thawing: ""Allow to thaw on counter for 60-90 minutes. DO NOT MICROWAVE FROZEN CRUST""

So here we are at 7pm on a weekday with two failed crusts and a frozen one that won't thaw nearly in time for us to eat dinner. We ended up ordering pizza and saving the filling for next week.

This morning, discussing it with a co-worker revealed that you're supposed to use parchment paper to line the crust first. -___- Of course, I should know better.

So for all my fellow cooks out there learning new equipment, here are your two hot tips for pie weights:

1) wash and dry your weights thoroughly before use
2) line the crust with parchment paper before you bake

,Cooking,"TLDR: Need to make party snacks that will totally own! 


Last year we hosted a pre game party before a big charity event, the event includes dinner and snacks so we just made cocktails and didn't bother providing any food at our house. 
Normally when we host, I love cooking and showing off, but this wasn't the time for that. Except...


This girl we invited came with buffalo chicken dip, baked filled wonton cups, baked brie (&lt;-- all homemade), cheeses, assorted crackers, and jams, the specialty ones you find near the deli. She's my SO's coworker and it was her first time at our place and my first time meeting her. Yes, everything was delicious and everyone loved it but she just... in my house... the audacity!


We have another event coming up next weekend and I won't make the same mistake. I am filled with petty revenge! I don't hate her or anything, I'm rather impressed in fact, I just got a reputation to uphold and a kitchen to defend. 


I need to make something amazing, something people will eat up, something showy. I am willing to call off work that day to spend the day cooking, I'm willing to shell out a bit more money, I'll even make a croquembouche cone if that's what it takes (really don't want to though).


Most of our friends are basic home cooks or less, so could be something that's not necessarily labor intensive or expensive.
I've made hummus before, which is not hard but people are always impressed. I was thinking about cream puffs shaped like swans, I've made it before and it looks way more difficult than it is. Also got ingredients for a smoked salmon and lettuce spring rolls.

I recently saw a comment where someone described an amazing white bean + chicken puréed soup. 

I’m one week removed from double jaw surgery, and was REALLY hyped to make this soup. I saved the comment, but now can’t find it. 

I believe it was something like:

White beans
Chicken
Carrot
Onion
Celery

And well... that’s all i remember. 

I’ve scoured the internet, but am struggling to find a puréed soup that matches. Either it has chicken and is chunky, or it doesn’t have chicken and is creamy.

,Cooking,"I eat Stouffers Mac and Cheese at least three times a week. I want to save some money and was told that I can make it myself and it would be much better. But after three attempts I am starting to lose hope. Stouffers is much more satisfying than what I have cooked. Specifically it is the sauce that just doesn't do it for me - it seems to be missing some kind of wonderful kick that Stouffers has.

Does anyone have some advice on how to make my mac and cheese great?

I use the following ingredients:

    1 tablespoon butter
    1 tablespoon flour
    2 cups of whole milk (usually need to add another 0.5 to 1 cup of milk because it is way too thick)
    1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese
    2 cups of macaroni elbows

I use the following method:

&gt;Prepare the milk so it can warm up to room temperature

&gt;Add the butter until it is sizzling and throw in the flour. Mix constantly until tan. This probably takes 5 minutes maybe more.

&gt;Add the milk in and mix constantly. It takes a long time, at least 5 minutes maybe 10 minutes before all the flakes disappear and it starts to thicken.

&gt;Add the cheese in and mix constantly. After 2-3 minutes it becomes way to thick so I add another 0.5 to 1 cup of milk.

&gt;At some point mix some pre-al-dente macaroni elbows and stir until the macaroni becomes al-dente and then eat.

I do not have an oven, so I'm not able to broil some cheese on top. Is that the secret? If so then I am out of luck.

Everyone says you need to buy a block of cheese instead of buying pre-shredded cheese. I'm willing to try this, but I find it hard to believe that the difference between my barely adequate macncheese and a good stouffers' version is simply the difference between a block of cheese and pre-shredded cheese. 

Should I be adding mustard powder or anything like that?

I want to save some money and was told that I can make it myself and it would be much better. But after three attempts I am starting to lose hope. Stouffers is much more satisfying than what I have cooked. Specifically it is the sauce that just doesn&amp;#39;t do it for me - it seems to be missing some kind of wonderful kick that Stouffers has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have some advice on how to make my mac and cheese great?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use the following ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon flour
2 cups of whole milk (usually need to add another 0.5 to 1 cup of milk because it is way too thick)
1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese
2 cups of macaroni elbows
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use the following method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepare the milk so it can warm up to room temperature&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the butter until it is sizzling and throw in the flour. Mix constantly until tan. This probably takes 5 minutes maybe more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the milk in and mix constantly. It takes a long time, at least 5 minutes maybe 10 minutes before all the flakes disappear and it starts to thicken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the cheese in and mix constantly. After 2-3 minutes it becomes way to thick so I add another 0.5 to 1 cup of milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point mix some pre-al-dente macaroni elbows and stir until the macaroni becomes al-dente and then eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not have an oven, so I&amp;#39;m not able to broil some cheese on top. Is that the secret? If so then I am out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone says you need to buy a block of cheese instead of buying pre-shredded cheese. I&amp;#39;m willing to try this, but I find it hard to believe that the difference between my barely adequate macncheese and a good stouffers&amp;#39; version is simply the difference between a block of cheese and pre-shredded cheese. &lt;/p&gt;

,Cooking,"So this is a recipe my mom made for my older sister and I for as long as either of us can remember, although slightly tweaked by me over the years for various reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

* 1 can Campbells Bean with Bacon Soup
* 1 can whole milk
* 1/2 can half and half
* 1/4 tsp roasted garlic powder
* 1/4 tsp onion powder
* 1/4 tsp umami powder

So, originally my mom just used the milk and half and half, over time I started using the additional seasonings to deal with the coppery taste that this particular soup sometimes gets coming out of a can. I have researched the reason for it happening to some extent, and as far as I can tell Campbells is aware of the issue, but has no fix for it and it's supposedly not a health hazard, just an off taste.

Combine all ingredients in a stock pot (I prefer a saucier) and cook on medium low heat until it thickens, stirring frequently. I cook it until it almost has the thickness of a gravy.

I also make this ahead of time to take to work for dipping sandwiches in. When I do, I transfer the soup to a tall tupperware or jar, and blend with a stick blender until smooth because I don't care about the texture of the beans. Also, doing this results in an even thicker soup

It's absolutely amazing for dipping a grilled cheese sandwich in. I just made a smoked gouda grilled cheese to dip in it and that was even more amazing.

Enjoy!

I’ve read that in Japan they don’t usually serve course one at a time, but all at once. But I will do dessert separately.


Ok so first I wanted to make a very simple soup. I’m thinking miso?

Then I wanted to do a bento box, because I always thought they looked awesome. I don’t know what to put it in but was thinking either fruit or pickled vegetables cut into cute shapes. This is something that’s meant to be refreshing.

Then a sushi platter. My partner doesn’t like seafood, so I was going to do a vegetarian platter. Definitely sweet potato but I’d like to have three options so other suggestions would be great! Do you know what sauces I should serve for this?

I don’t know if I will have the time or energy, but some sort of dumpling appetizer would be great. Any suggestions?


Finally the main meal. I’m pretty lost here. This is where I really want to “real” Japanese to shine. Some sort of curry maybe? I’m open to suggestions as long as it isn’t sea food.

Dessert. This is most fun for me. Some ideas I had were those fluffy pancakes (are they hard to make though? And I’m guessing I couldn’t make them ahead of time I’d have to step away and cook dessert? I’d rather not do that), Mochi stuffed with red bean paste or other pastes, and Japanese confectionaries (how difficult is it to make those?).

How much do I love him? I love him so much I'm going to make something he HATES so that he isn't jealous about supper: shrimp.

It wouldn't matter what shrimp dish I make, so I'm making my personal favorite: Grilled garlic-lime shrimp.

Melt 1/2 stick of butter with the juice of five Key limes, 2 TBSP extra virgin olive oil, two cloves of garlic (smashed), and white pepper. (I think the butter has enough salt in it, but you can add more if you want.) Heat the grill, then dip the shrimp in the butter-lime-garlic and toss on.

,Cooking," 

I've found that I love camping, hiking, and the outdoors. One of the things I really enjoy doing is cooking over an open fire or a bed of coals As I venture deeper into the woods for longer I realize I'd like to leave my cooler at home when I go hiking/camping. The thing is that I still want to make foods from at least semi-fresh ingredients rather than freeze dried or canned foods without having to lug a cooler with me. At some point it dawned on me that at one point in time many of the foods we refrigerate didn't always need to be. A long time ago or even in some places today people didn't refrigerate eggs, cheese, cured meats, milk. At some point along the way we started processing or packaging things differently and requiring them to be refrigerated to extend shelf-life. My question is what commonly refrigerated things today will actually last awhile without being refrigerated assuming they are kept in a cool(ish) dry place like a backpack? What tips or tricks are there to help prolong edibility of things without refrigeration?

The thing is that I still want to make foods from at least semi-fresh ingredients rather than freeze dried or canned foods without having to lug a cooler with me. At some point it dawned on me that at one point in time many of the foods we refrigerate didn&amp;#39;t always need to be. A long time ago or even in some places today people didn&amp;#39;t refrigerate eggs, cheese, cured meats, milk. At some point along the way we started processing or packaging things differently and requiring them to be refrigerated to extend shelf-life. My question is what commonly refrigerated things today will actually last awhile without being refrigerated assuming they are kept in a cool(ish) dry place like a backpack? What tips or tricks are there to help prolong edibility of things without refrigeration?&lt;/p&gt;

So just over the Christmas period I was gifted a cast iron skillet which I intend on using. I've done a lot of research on cast iron so feel like I'm ready to put it to good use, but also still have a couple of questions.

So I know that cooking acidic foods can strip the seasoning and its best to only cook acidic foods if you have a large amount of seasoning. My skillet came pre-seasoned and I intend to season it again today, but would I be able to cook shakshuka for example in this skillet without it ruining the seasoning?

,Cooking,"I'm going to do a some venting, so please bear with me. TL;DR at the bottom. 

My husband and I have been together for 10 years. I can count on two hands the amount of times he has actually prepared and cooked us a meal. I do love cooking, and I've become good at it. He isn't bad by any means, and I've really enjoyed all the meals he has made.

I'm growing increasingly frustrated with his lack of help in this area. He won't clean any part of the bathroom because he has a ""thing"" about germs; he won't take the trash out for the same reason; he doesn't take care of the cats because that was our agreement for getting them (it was); he won't take care of the dog for reasons unknown; he won't do any cleaning of the fridge or sink; and he won't cook because his reasoning is that I like to do it. 

Don't get me wrong, he does clean. He declutters, vacuums, sweeps, mops, does the laundry including mine, and is responsible for doing the dishes after dinner, among other things, but I don't know that he realizes what a chore it is sometimes to cook after a long day. I asked him to make dinner the other night after a particularly long day and he declined. It was literally just tacos and took me less than 30 minutes start to finish, but he said that I'm ""better at it"" and like cooking (so clearly I must want to every day)? I tried to explain what a luxury it is to be able to relax from the time you get home til when you go to bed while I'm in the kitchen for anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour and a half, but he doesn't really get it.

Finally today (which is actually our anniversary) he asked if I wanted anything on his way home and specified he wasn't picking up dinner because I should really cook since I had a day off. For reference, the reason I had a ""day off"" was because someone broke into my car and shattered my windshield, so my ""day off"" was filled with police reports, taking myself to get my window replaced, and then working from home in between.

TL;DR I am really, desperately in need of very, very quick recipes. Like under 30 minutes. He will not eat leftovers. He will not touch anything that's been reheated. He doesn't like soups or stews except chili because he doesn't like his food all mixed.

,Cooking,"Hey guys. As you know by the title I will tell you some truths about all cooking TV shows that you see on TV and some of the things that I will tell you will BLOW YOUR MIND. 

First of all, I want to acknowledge you by the fact that I was in a cooking TV show (won't mention which one for not tracking my identity ). I am telling you this because I for once have been wondering how do they do that so perfectly how that and how that. Many mysteries but no answers. Here you go

**First of all.** The way you get into a show is either you get called ( to get called you must be found by them by your ethnic background or get recommended ). You cant just sign up and voila. 

**2.** You won't be called and oh hey ok come. You will get a lot of calls. Meetings. Different things that you cant and can do and it will all be stressful. I almost quit halfway into them accepting me for the show.

**3.** **YOU NEVER EVER EVER** get to cook something by yourself or just out of nowhere. What I mean ""just out of nowhere"" when you see those mystery boxes and in most cases, people get from the judges what they cook. That is **FAKE**. They notify you in advance of what you will cook so you can prepare. This got me blown away btw.

**4**. When going on the show. You have to get dressed by them, makeup by them, you have to shower, you cant wear electronics due to those little microphones that everyone has. 

**5.** When going on the show you will have a guide telling you where to go, what to do while on it and a lot more stuff. This is not every time just when entering, leaving and similar actions.

**6.** RETAKING SCENES. Yes, we retake scenes. And a lot of the scenes that are normal are left out. Judges can always stop the scene but you cant

**7.** You know those moments when chefs look like they are describing the scene in a room full of things like ""I am stressed out don't know what to do hope I win this"" while not cooking. Those are done when EVERYTHING ends. Literally. You have to wait to do that and then you can say that and they tell you what you will be describing etc.. Knowing this I always look at the body language to see who won and not. 

**8.** The rewards ( money etc. ) Is given a month after. Yes, this is sad but it is how it is.

,Cooking,"Korean Fried Chicken is one of my favourite food and I've spent the past few years creating something that's close to what's been served in Korea. Because I want everyone to get cooking, I have posted a video on how to make 4 different types of my favourite Korean Fried chicken. For anyone interested, here is the link: [https://youtu.be/ggCmosKSvvw](https://youtu.be/ggCmosKSvvw)

But in Summary

Ingredients for Fried Chicken

* Chicken
* Pre-made frying mix (or mix flour, cornstarch, baking powder, garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper) 
* Full fat milk (why are you making fried chicken with skim fat milk) 
* Vegetable oil
* Salt
* Pepper
* MSG

Tips and tricks

* The longer you marinade the chicken in milk and seasoning mixture, the better chicken will taste
* MSG is required if you want to replicate that restaurant quality taste. You don't need much, but it might be the most important ingredient in this recipe
* Shaking the wet battered chicken in the dry batter gives that wavey crispy texture, I've tried to just rub it on and it completely changed the texture
* Do not crowd the pot - if you do, you will get well oiled steamed chicken rather than crispy fried chicken
* All my measurements are in portion sizes rather than tbsp and cup sizes. Because this way, you can make this without using the measuring tools

,Cooking,"Simple syrups. I don't know why I never bothered before. Send me suggestions you have enjoyed - both for syrups or uses for the syrup!

So far, I made:

* plain simple syrup

* cinnamon syrup

* orange syrup

* pineapple syrup

All of these are mostly used to sweeten beverages, such as coffee and *jamaica*.

I made the pineapple one based on the seriouseats recipe, and am now attempting to extract some from orange rinds (the recipe was for lemon, but I figured I'd try). I am loving it! Except for the time I put in ny coffee into the crystalizing cinnamon syrup, and ended up with coffee so sweet, I had to throw away, even after I dumped shitty office coffee on top. Yeah, underestimated the amount big time.

Background:
It started with thr boring task of trying to mix sugar into my jamaica. So much work. So I made simple syrup. It was cool. So I wondered if a flavored version would be nice. It was. I make about 1.5 cups a batch, and it lasts me about 2 weeks. 

Orange syrup:
I made this by boiling orange rinds. It has a nice subtle flavor. I tried a piece of now-candied rind, but it's not my thing. I am also trying the seriouseats recipe where you just dump some sugar to pull the flavor from the rind. I'll have to compare, but the one I boiled had a subtle flavor, and I expect the sugar one will be stronger.

 I guess mango will be next for this method.

Butterfly and wash the shrimp. Put them in a 13""x9"" baking dish or similar and spread them out evenly. Add kosher salt and black pepper. (I dont have a actual measurement for the amounts, season to taste. Also you will use more salt and the whole pepper corns later so not too much.)

Cut the cucumbers and thin slice the onions and add to the shrimp. Take 2 of the serrano peppers and slice them into rounds. Add them to the shrimp and  mix it again adding a little more kosher salt and pepper. 

In a blender add all of the chillies, garlic clove, pepper corns and the juice from the remaining limes and blend it until everything is dissolved. Taste the mix and add kosher salt if needed. Add the mix to the shrimp mixing it all up with the lime juice that was already in the shrimp and put it in the fridge for about 20 min.

The time went off but the cheese wasn't melted yet. 

I gave it more time. Still not melted.  Strange.  The crust was getting pretty brown, so I stuck the pizza under the broiler. Nothing.

,Cooking,"I pick up my daughter from daycare at 5 PM and put her to bed at 7 PM, after which my husband and I have dinner together. Thankfully I work from home so I can do some dinner prep during the day to help make sure we eat at a reasonable time (e.g. before 8 PM).

I love to cook and hate waking up early so this is the best setup for us currently.\]

Anyway, here's what I'm making tonight:

[*Moroccan-Spiced Fish*](https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/browse-all-recipes/moroccan-spiced-fish)

* *12 small carrots, halved lengthwise if large*
* *1½ pounds fingerling potatoes, halved lengthwise*
* *1 lemon, thinly sliced*
* *½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper*
* *3 tablespoons olive oil, divided*
* *1¼ teaspoons kosher salt, divided*
* *½ teaspoon ground cumin*
* *½ teaspoon ground coriander*
* *⅛ teaspoon ground allspice*
* *4 6-oz. skinless cod fillets*
* *3 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley*

*Preheat oven to 425°F. Toss carrots, potatoes, lemon, pepper, 2 tablespoons of the oil, and 1 teaspoon of the salt on a rimmed baking sheet; arrange in a single layer. Roast until potatoes are almost tender, 15 to 20 minutes.*

*Meanwhile, stir together cumin, coriander, allspice, and remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a small bowl. Rub the mixture evenly over cod and season with remaining ¼ teaspoon salt.*

*Remove baking sheet from oven and increase heat to broil. Nestle cod fillets among vegetables and return to oven. Broil on top rack until fish is just cooked through and vegetables are tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Top with parsley.*

Tonight I plan to prep and season the veggies ahead of time, place them on a baking sheet, cover them, and keep them in the fridge. Then I'll take them out of the fridge and preheat the oven during the kiddo's bedtime routine so that as soon as she's down I can put the veggies straight in the oven and proceed with the rest of the recipe as written

The types of questions I ask myself are: Will the veggies dry out in the fridge? Will their texture be compromised by being preseasoned? Which proteins (e.g. fish, pork) are negatively affected by things like preseasoning and acidic marinades?

I'd love to hear your make-ahead tips and tricks for getting fresh meals on the dinner table in good time! Thanks in advance!

It's not for sale in the Marlboro miles store anymore, but it's not too expensive to get a used copy on E-bay or whatever. They have this one recipe where you core apples, stuff them with nuts, cinnamon, butter and various other things. Then wrap them in foil and grill them so the stuffings soak in.

Here's the video on how to make it: [https://youtu.be/DSTm3aku29I](https://youtu.be/DSTm3aku29I)

Here's the recipe:

INGREDIENTS \* 2 cups + 2 tablespoons all purpose flour 

\* 1 teaspoon baking soda 

\* 2 teaspoons cornstarch 

\* 1 teaspoon salt 

\* 1 ½ sticks (6 oz) butter, melted, browned and cooled 

\* 1 cup dark brown sugar, lightly packed 

\* ½ cup granulated sugar 

\* 2 large eggs 

\* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 

\* 1/4 cup dark chocolate chips 

\* 1/4 cup milk chocolate chips 

\* 1/4 cup white chocolate chips 

\* 1/4 cup caramel baking chips 

\* 1 tbsp flake salt  

INSTRUCTIONS 

1. In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt. Set aside. 

2. In a small sauce pan, melt butter over medium heat. Swirl the pan occasionally. The butter will foam and eventually turn a golden brown color.  Remove from heat and let cool. 

3. In a large bowl, beat together the cooled melted butter and the sugars with a hand-mixer or stand-mixer for about one minute. Then, add in the eggs and vanilla extract. Beat until just combined. 

4. Slowly add in the dry ingredients and mix briefly, just until there are no flour clumps left. Fold in all of the chocolate and caramel chips. 

5. Cover and refrigerate the dough for at least one hour (the colder the better). 

6. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and preheat the oven to 350°F, making sure you have the racks in the middle of the oven. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. 

7. Scoop 1/4 cup of cookie dough at a time and roll into balls. Place at least 2” apart on the baking sheet.  

8. Top each ball of cookie dough with a pinch of flake salt. 

9. Bake for about 10-14 minutes, rotating half-way through, or until the cookies have spread out and the edges are golden, but the centers of the cookies still look soft and undercooked. Every oven is different, so watch closely and cook them to your preference. 

10. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets until the cookies are firm enough to remove, about 15 minutes. Before they are completely cooled, you may add more chocolate chips by gently pressing them into the cookie. 

11. Repeat with remaining batches, until all cookies are baked.

I hope I'm not repeating a question but I couldn't find a similar thread. I keep hearing about Instant Pots and how great they are but I'm not convinced I need another appliance for my kitchen.

I have said the final farewell to all of my grandparents and my parents. When they died we all sorted through their belongings and chose a few things to keep. Most of my selections were from the kitchen. My mom's mom provided a pastry blender. My dad's mom a little screen sieve. My mom provided a few items, the most special to me is a little aluminum measuring cup that she always had in the flour canister. Lots of memories came along for the ride with that measuring cup. It is now in my flour canister and I think of her every time I use it. It is still usually painful nearly three years later but I will always keep it in the canister. Tonight it was eggplant parmesan and the breading needed some flour. I both hate and cherish using it and am missing her a lot right now. I wish I could post a photo of that simple measuring cup in this text only sub; you'll just have to imagine it.

If there's a point to this post I suppose it is to encourage everyone to cherish and make time for the important things in life with people and cooking being at the top of the list.

EDIT I totally forgot about imgur. Thx for the reminder u/drunky_crowette.

EDIT2 it seems cliche but I really did not expect such a big response to this post. I have two general comments. First, there must have been a really successful ad campaign mamy decades ago that persuaded the mothers of the day to use this specific cup for flour. I can't believe how many commenters have stated they have the exact same cup in their flour.

&lt;p&gt;EDIT I totally forgot about imgur. Thx for the reminder &lt;a href=""/u/drunky_crowette""&gt;u/drunky_crowette&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a link to a pic of the aforementioned measuring cup:  &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/gallery/4Tqq5De""&gt;https://imgur.com/gallery/4Tqq5De&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT2 it seems cliche but I really did not expect such a big response to this post. I have two general comments. First, there must have been a really successful ad campaign mamy decades ago that persuaded the mothers of the day to use this specific cup for flour. I can&amp;#39;t believe how many commenters have stated they have the exact same cup in their flour. Second, I suppose awards and karma are nice, but what is most meaningful to me is how this post has connected so deeply with so many people and in some cases helped them move forward a bit in their grieving process. It has been healing for me to see that happen. ❤&lt;/p&gt;

,Cooking,"About 5 or 6 years ago, I made some lamb rogan josh and ended up with far too much leftover spice rub. I didn't want to throw it all away, so I stuck it in a ziploc and labelled it.

We have such a great time cooking together and discovering/trying new recipes, that I wanted to create a post dedicated to just that. 

Is there a favorite recipe of yours that you can share with us and the rest of the community? We would love to add to the arsenal, and are always looking for new ideas! Any and all recipes are welcome as we’re not picky. 

I’ll start the discussion with a recipe we really enjoy that my father came up with. It’s amazing and I highly recommend you try it (especially if you like a bit of heat). See below for the recipe, and thanks for sharing!

Spicy Salmon Burritos

Ingredients:
1 lb Atlantic salmon (or salmon of choice)
Tortilla of choice
Jezebel spicy spice seasoning
Olive oil
Pico de Gallo:
3 Roma tomatoes
1/4 white onion
1/8 bunch cilantro
1 jalapeño de seeded
1/2 lime
Adobo sauce:
1/4 cup sour cream
7 oz can La Costena Chipotles in adobo sauce
Salt

Recipe:

1. Put sour cream in small bowl
2. Add 1/2 can sauce ONLY from La costena chipotles (add more to taste for greater heat/chipotle flavor)
3. Mix together, add salt to taste, mix again, and place in fridge.
4. Dice the Roma tomatoes, white onion, and de seeded jalapeño and place in separate bowl. Rough chop cilantro and add to bowl. Squeeze lime juice into bowl, then mix together. Add salt to taste, mix again, and place in fridge.
5. Lightly coat salmon in olive oil, and coat lightly on both sides with the jezebel spicy spice rub.
6. Grill salmon for about 5-7 mins each side on high heat per inch of thickness, or until salmon reaches internal temperature of 145F and flakes easily with a fork. If baking, preheat oven to 450F and bake for approximately 12-15 mins. 
7. Place salmon in a small bowl and break up into shreds/small pieces with a fork, ensuring that seasoning from salmon is mixed throughout.
8. Remove adobo/sour cream sauce and Pico de Gallo 
from the fridge, and heat tortillas on stove or in microwave.
9. Place tortilla on plate, add salmon, then Pico de Gallo, and adobo/sour cream sauce to finish. Wrap ingredients in tortilla.

&lt;li&gt;add water until covering everything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add seasoning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mix everything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put inside a vapor cooker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cook for 25 mins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However after 30 mins the rice was still hard. I&amp;#39;ve added more water, and cooked for 20 minutes more. The rice was softer but still not quite how I like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this how the red rice is supposed to be?&lt;/p&gt;

,Cooking,"I feel like we get a lot of questions about what to keep on hand in your pantry/fridge so I wanted to share six of my go-to pasta sauces (plus a couple more that I don't like but maybe you will) which can all be made with 11 ingredients that are really easy to keep around. All of these recipes come together in like 20 minutes and are almost impossible to mess up.

#The Ingredients

1. **Whole peeled canned tomatoes.** The best tomatoes are generally what end up whole in the cans plus they don't have any firming agents that can keep them from cooking down nicely. imo no point in springing for San Marzano most of the time. I'd recommend Muir Glenn in the US or Mutti in Europe. Keep a few cans around always—obviously they're not going bad anytime soon.
2. **Tomato paste.** The tubes are handy if you'll be using little bits somewhat frequently. I think ATK recommends Cento for this one in the US. I use Mutti again in Europe.
3. **Garlic.** It's garlic. You know the deal. Keeps for a couple weeks at least somewhere cool and dry.
4. **Yellow onions.** Yellow onions are mildest and best for cooked applications imo, but feel free to use white or red if that's how you get your jollies. Also keeps for a couple weeks.
5. **Shallots.** Even milder than the yellow onions. In a pinch, you could use onions in all the recipes that call for shallots. Or shallots in all the recipes that call for onions if you've got that Rockefeller money *Also* keeps for a couple weeks.
6. **Lemons.** Nothing fancy needed. Just plain old lemons. If you like the zest, maybe spring for organic. They keep a week or two in the fridge.
7. **Heavy cream.** Heavy cream or heavy whipping cream both work—just make sure it's not sweetened. Generally lasts about two weeks.
8. **Parmigiano reggiano.** Get the real stuff in its whole form—no ground up shit. It can be DOP if you want but doesn't have to be. There's plenty of great parm out there that isn't DOP-certified (but none of it it sold by Kraft). I personally prefer a 24-month most of the time, but a more complex 36-month has its charms too. It'll last quite a while wrapped up in the fridge.
9. **Pecorino romano.** Another grating cheese, but quite different from parm in flavor. While parm is more about nutty umami, pecorino brings more saltiness and a hint of tang. I'm probably in the minority here, but if both cheeses were in a burning building and I could only save one, I'd save the pecorino. You *can* substitute them for each other in a pinch but, like I said, they're not all that similar.
10. **Guanciale or pancetta.** Guanciale can be challenging to find outside of Europe, but it's worth the effort to track it down. (I think you can even order it on Amazon). It's fattier, sweeter, and milder in flavor than pancetta, but pancetta is much easier to find so you can sub that if needed. You can freeze either for quite a while. Just cut into thickish slabs (roughly ¼"" or 0.5cm) and separate with wax paper then keep it in the freezer. You can cut it into lardons straight from the freezer (it's way easier that way actually) and use it without thawing.
11. **Vodka.** Alternative uses: getting you drunk. Lasts forever.

I'm also assuming that you have some real basics on hand already. Namely salt, black pepper, chili flakes, olive oil, and butter. You'll need the actual pasta too. I recommend De Cecco across the board.

#The Recipes

1. **Basic tomato sauce/arrabbiata.** (Tomatoes, garlic, parm, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). My basic quick tomato sauce is actually based on [Serious Eat's arrabbiata recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/02/penne-pasta-arrabbiata-sauce-recipe.html). If you don't like spice, you can dial the pepper back as much as you like. This works with just about any shape. Penne's a classic, but casarecce might be my fave. Also great on [homemade gnocchi](https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/03/technique-fresh-ricotta-gnocchi-fast.html).
2. **All'amatriciana.** (Tomatoes, onion, pecorino, guanciale/pancetta, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). This is hands down the king of pasta sauces in my book. The pork fat takes everything that's great about tomato sauce and turns it up to 11 with minimal added effort. I use Marcella Hazan's recipe, which you can find [here](https://cookingfrombooks.com/2014/05/12/pasta-allamatriciana-2/). The only alteration I make is I render and crisp the pork first (starting in a cold pan) and *then* add the onions. idk why Marcella never seems to brown meat. Bucatini is supposedly the classic with this, but in Italy I've seen it much more with mezze maniche and I prefer it that way. That's a tough shape to find though, so you can sub something like rigatoni.
3. **Alla gricia.** (Pecorino, guanciale, black pepper, olive oil). Alla gricia is basically the midway point between all'amatriciana and cacio e pepe. Once again, I think the pork really improves on cacio e pepe. While it's fine to sub pancetta in the last recipe, I think this one suffers a bit more from the substitution. I recommend the [Serious Eats recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2018/11/pasta-alla-gricia.html). As with all'amatriciana, mezze maniche or rigatoni is the move.
4. **Cacio e pepe.** (Pecorino, black pepper, olive oil, butter). Is it as good as alla gricia? Despite being much more well-known, I'd say no. But sometimes you can't find guanciale or just can't be assed to render it. Cacio e pepe to the rescue. Once again, [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/02/spaghetti-cacio-e-pepe-recipe.html). Keep in mind that legit pecorino is very salty, so don't oversalt the pasta water. If all pecorino is too much for you, experiment with using part parm. Spaghetti is the way to go for this one.
5. **Alla vodka.** (Tomato paste, shallot, heavy cream, parmesan, vodka, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). Somehow this sauce hits all the exact same comforting notes as boxed mac and cheese (I mean that in the best way possible). I really like the [Bon Appetit](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/fusilli-alla-vodka-basil-parmesan) recipe. Fusilli is awesome with this, but the classic penne also works.
6. **Al limone.** (Garlic, shallot, lemon, heavy cream, parm, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). A break from the tomato-y cheesy porkiness. This is one of my favorites. I use the [Cooks Illustrated recipe](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/videos/1731-spaghetti-with-lemon-and-olive-oil-al-limone) (non-video is paywalled) but add some garlic, chili flake, and a bunch more lemon juice. I skip the zest and herbage. Use spaghetti for this one.

Finally, a couple honorable mentions: you also have all the ingredients here for **aglio e olio** and **alfredo**. I don't personally like either all that much, but I know lots of people go gaga over aglio e olio especially. Try 'em out if they sound up your alley. If you keep eggs around, you could also do **carbonara.** Again, not my fave, but you do you.",t2_4uv35,False,,1,False,My love letter to pantry pastas,[],r/Cooking,False,6,,0,False,t3_ermku7,False,dark,,public,2181,4,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2181,,True,,False,,[],"{'gid_1': 2, 'gid_2': 1}",,True,,1579595502.0,text,6,,,text,self.Cooking,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel like we get a lot of questions about what to keep on hand in your pantry/fridge so I wanted to share six of my go-to pasta sauces (plus a couple more that I don&amp;#39;t like but maybe you will) which can all be made with 11 ingredients that are really easy to keep around. All of these recipes come together in like 20 minutes and are almost impossible to mess up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Ingredients&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole peeled canned tomatoes.&lt;/strong&gt; The best tomatoes are generally what end up whole in the cans plus they don&amp;#39;t have any firming agents that can keep them from cooking down nicely. imo no point in springing for San Marzano most of the time. I&amp;#39;d recommend Muir Glenn in the US or Mutti in Europe. Keep a few cans around always—obviously they&amp;#39;re not going bad anytime soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tomato paste.&lt;/strong&gt; The tubes are handy if you&amp;#39;ll be using little bits somewhat frequently. I think ATK recommends Cento for this one in the US. I use Mutti again in Europe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Garlic.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s garlic. You know the deal. Keeps for a couple weeks at least somewhere cool and dry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yellow onions.&lt;/strong&gt; Yellow onions are mildest and best for cooked applications imo, but feel free to use white or red if that&amp;#39;s how you get your jollies. Also keeps for a couple weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shallots.&lt;/strong&gt; Even milder than the yellow onions. In a pinch, you could use onions in all the recipes that call for shallots. Or shallots in all the recipes that call for onions if you&amp;#39;ve got that Rockefeller money &lt;em&gt;Also&lt;/em&gt; keeps for a couple weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lemons.&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing fancy needed. Just plain old lemons. If you like the zest, maybe spring for organic. They keep a week or two in the fridge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heavy cream.&lt;/strong&gt; Heavy cream or heavy whipping cream both work—just make sure it&amp;#39;s not sweetened. Generally lasts about two weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parmigiano reggiano.&lt;/strong&gt; Get the real stuff in its whole form—no ground up shit. It can be DOP if you want but doesn&amp;#39;t have to be. There&amp;#39;s plenty of great parm out there that isn&amp;#39;t DOP-certified (but none of it it sold by Kraft). I personally prefer a 24-month most of the time, but a more complex 36-month has its charms too. It&amp;#39;ll last quite a while wrapped up in the fridge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pecorino romano.&lt;/strong&gt; Another grating cheese, but quite different from parm in flavor. While parm is more about nutty umami, pecorino brings more saltiness and a hint of tang. I&amp;#39;m probably in the minority here, but if both cheeses were in a burning building and I could only save one, I&amp;#39;d save the pecorino. You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; substitute them for each other in a pinch but, like I said, they&amp;#39;re not all that similar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guanciale or pancetta.&lt;/strong&gt; Guanciale can be challenging to find outside of Europe, but it&amp;#39;s worth the effort to track it down. (I think you can even order it on Amazon). It&amp;#39;s fattier, sweeter, and milder in flavor than pancetta, but pancetta is much easier to find so you can sub that if needed. You can freeze either for quite a while. Just cut into thickish slabs (roughly ¼&amp;quot; or 0.5cm) and separate with wax paper then keep it in the freezer. You can cut it into lardons straight from the freezer (it&amp;#39;s way easier that way actually) and use it without thawing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vodka.&lt;/strong&gt; Alternative uses: getting you drunk. Lasts forever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also assuming that you have some real basics on hand already. Namely salt, black pepper, chili flakes, olive oil, and butter. You&amp;#39;ll need the actual pasta too. I recommend De Cecco across the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Recipes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic tomato sauce/arrabbiata.&lt;/strong&gt; (Tomatoes, garlic, parm, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). My basic quick tomato sauce is actually based on &lt;a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/02/penne-pasta-arrabbiata-sauce-recipe.html""&gt;Serious Eat&amp;#39;s arrabbiata recipe&lt;/a&gt;. If you don&amp;#39;t like spice, you can dial the pepper back as much as you like. This works with just about any shape. Penne&amp;#39;s a classic, but casarecce might be my fave. Also great on &lt;a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/03/technique-fresh-ricotta-gnocchi-fast.html""&gt;homemade gnocchi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All&amp;#39;amatriciana.&lt;/strong&gt; (Tomatoes, onion, pecorino, guanciale/pancetta, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). This is hands down the king of pasta sauces in my book. The pork fat takes everything that&amp;#39;s great about tomato sauce and turns it up to 11 with minimal added effort. I use Marcella Hazan&amp;#39;s recipe, which you can find &lt;a href=""https://cookingfrombooks.com/2014/05/12/pasta-allamatriciana-2/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The only alteration I make is I render and crisp the pork first (starting in a cold pan) and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; add the onions. idk why Marcella never seems to brown meat. Bucatini is supposedly the classic with this, but in Italy I&amp;#39;ve seen it much more with mezze maniche and I prefer it that way. That&amp;#39;s a tough shape to find though, so you can sub something like rigatoni.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alla gricia.&lt;/strong&gt; (Pecorino, guanciale, black pepper, olive oil). Alla gricia is basically the midway point between all&amp;#39;amatriciana and cacio e pepe.

As with all&amp;#39;amatriciana, mezze maniche or rigatoni is the move.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cacio e pepe.&lt;/strong&gt; (Pecorino, black pepper, olive oil, butter). Is it as good as alla gricia? Despite being much more well-known, I&amp;#39;d say no.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alla vodka.&lt;/strong&gt; (Tomato paste, shallot, heavy cream, parmesan, vodka, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). Somehow this sauce hits all the exact same comforting notes as boxed mac and cheese (I mean that in the best way possible).

&lt;/ol&gt;

I called up my mom and asked her for the recipe.

Dumplings

* 1 lb of ground pork
* 1 cup of cabbage (not nappa) diced
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 clove or garlic (minced)
* 6 scallions (whites cut up)
* 1 tsp sesame oil
* 2 TBSP soy sauce
* 1 tsp Chinese cooking wine
* 1 package of round dumpling wrappers (about 35-45 per package)

Dipping Sauce

* 1/2 cup soy sauce
* 1/4 cup Chinese Chinkiang black vinegar
* 1 tsp ginger (cut 2 thin slices into very thin strips)

&amp;#x200B;

Chop up the cabbage and put in a big bowl and mix in the salt.  Let it sit and wilt a bit.  My mom said that this makes it softer for mixing. Let it sit while you prep the other ingredients.

Combine the ingredients for the dipping sauce.  The ginger will infuse the sauce nicely. :)

Mix pork, cabbage, garlic, scallions, sesame oil, 2 TBSP soy sauce, cooking wine in a bowl until well combined.  Make a small meat pancake and fry it in a skillet.  Taste test and adjust seasonings.

Now it's time to wrap. Use about a rounded teaspoon of filling per wrapper. (YouTube has some really good videos).

To cook the dumplings:. Add about a 1/2 TBSP canola oil to a non-stick pan. Add the dumplings, one by one into the pan...make sure to rub some of the oil in the pan onto the bottom of each dumpling.  Add about 3 TBSP of water.  Cook, covered, on med to low heat for about 7 - 9minutes.  (I usually like to use lower heat in my cooking so that I don't burn my foods.)  Check to see that the dumpling skins look steamed through.  If not steamed through, and the pan is dry, add another TBSP of water.

Once the dumplings look steamed through, take the cover off and turn up the heat a little to crips the bottoms.

Plate the dumplings on a big plate and serve with the ginger dipping sauce.

Enjoy!

I'm from the UK and my partner from South Korea is coming over for the first time in 2 months for a few weeks.

My partner is very excited to come over to the UK so that we can cook fresh meals together to save some money for other travels (The UK is quite cheap for groceries). He knows I'm still learning how to cook and I have a few basic dishes I can whip up and some of my other cooking I'd eat myself but I don't feel confident cooking for other people.
I want to surprise him and learn some new recipes before he comes! Preferably Western cuisine he can't get over there (although pretty much anything non East Asian would be fine). I also just need to learn to cook in general.

,Cooking,"I was looking for a dish that would be extremely cost effective without being tasteless and decided black beans and brown rice with some seasoning would fit the bill. I referenced a recipe online for seasoning ideas, calling for 1 tsp of cumin, 1 tsp of chili powder, and 1/4 tsp of both salt and pepper to be added to 2 cups of beans just a little before they were done cooking. After the beans were done cooking, I put 2 cups of brown rice in with the beans, seasoned it the same as I had for the beans (the reference recipe I had used was only for seasoning the beans so I thought I'd add more to help the rice as well) and cooked the rice. When I went to taste it, everything was cooked perfectly fine, the beans and rice both tender, but it was incredibly bland. 

I ended up doubling the total amount of the seasonings little by little trying to get any semblance of taste out of the mix before I made a hail-Mary at fixing it and added about 1 tsp of garlic powder and 2 tsp of seasoning salt. I normally avoid using this particular seasoning salt because it seems to very easily overpower anything else it is with, but it did give the mix a fair bit of flavor and make it at least edible.

So the advice I wanted to seek out here would be

1. Is there any particular reason the cumin and chili powder would make no profile of their own in this? Far too little seasoning used? Or maybe those two seasonings just won't add any real flavor without more than rice and beans in the dish?
2. What seasonings would any of you use to get the most of simple black beans and brown rice?

And if needed for clarification, I used dried black beans I had soaked for 8 hours and rinsed before cooking and I made sure to thoroughly rinse the rice beforehand to remove starch.

I referenced a recipe online for seasoning ideas, calling for 1 tsp of cumin, 1 tsp of chili powder, and 1/4 tsp of both salt and pepper to be added to 2 cups of beans just a little before they were done cooking. After the beans were done cooking, I put 2 cups of brown rice in with the beans, seasoned it the same as I had for the beans (the reference recipe I had used was only for seasoning the beans so I thought I&amp;#39;d add more to help the rice as well) and cooked the rice. When I went to taste it, everything was cooked perfectly fine, the beans and rice both tender, but it was incredibly bland. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up doubling the total amount of the seasonings little by little trying to get any semblance of taste out of the mix before I made a hail-Mary at fixing it and added about 1 tsp of garlic powder and 2 tsp of seasoning salt. I normally avoid using this particular seasoning salt because it seems to very easily overpower anything else it is with, but it did give the mix a fair bit of flavor and make it at least edible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the advice I wanted to seek out here would be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there any particular reason the cumin and chili powder would make no profile of their own in this? Far too little seasoning used? Or maybe those two seasonings just won&amp;#39;t add any real flavor without more than rice and beans in the dish?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What seasonings would any of you use to get the most of simple black beans and brown rice?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if needed for clarification, I used dried black beans I had soaked for 8 hours and rinsed before cooking and I made sure to thoroughly rinse the rice beforehand to remove starch. The beans had enough leftover liquids in after they had finished cooking to get away with adding about 1/2 cup water to make sure the rice had enough water.&lt;/p&gt;

,Cooking,"I just wanted to share a couple of cooking anecdotes that really made me feel good over the weekend.

Last week, my youngest daughter (who is 13) kept talking about how she wanted to make a ""healthy meal"" for the family. So, on Friday she decided on making a stir fry using [this handy info-graphic that I show to everyone who is interested in making stir-fry.](http://imgur.com/gallery/HfWH4tt) She took chicken breast, asparagus, broccoli and baby corn and stir-fried it perfectly with the orange ginger sauce recipe. Everyone (meaning my wife, her older sister and my) thought it was really good and she was very proud of herself. I only gave a couple of cooking tips during the process, but she did all the physical work.  It was a pretty great feeling.

Fast forward to Sunday evening. We'd had a big after-church meal and my wife was at her monthly book club, so we weren't going to have any sort of family dinner. At one point in the evening, I saw the leftover broccoli and asparagus in the fridge and resolved to do something with it before it went bad. So, I just put it all on a baking sheet together, hit it with some olive oil, salt and pepper and roasted it. Now, whenever I normally cook broccoli, I always just steam it. The kiddos like that and I've never roasted it before. They've had roasted asparagus before and were luke warm on it. 

When it was done, I told them about it, left it on the counter and then went into another room. I didn't really expect them to like it, but when I came back into the kitchen a little while later - the baking sheet was empty. They'd devoured it all and were asking me to make roasted broccoli again soon. It was a pretty great feeling, knowing how much they liked that - and that it was fairly healthy.

I own a nutribullet and recently learned that blenders take mason jars and you can load them up ahead of time with frozen fruits and yogurt and then have them ready to go during the week.

Unfortunately, I didn't realize that standard mouth mason jars do not fit the nutribullet.

Doubling down, I didn't learn my lesson and returned my first set of standard-mouths and then purchased a set of wide-mouth mason jars. These also do not fit the nutribullet blade top.

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any sweet tips I can use to blend in mason jars (or something equivalently priced \[and preferably glass\])  using my nutribullet? If not, should I simply get a magicbullet so that I can use mason jars for smoothie prep?

,Cooking,"So I wanted to show you how to make a classic noodle dish from Yibin in the Sichuan province – burning noodles.

Now, upon seeing the words “Sichuan” and “Burning Noodles” in the same sentence, I can probably guess where your mind’s headed. Yep, these noodles are indeed pretty spicy. But no... that’s not actually why they’re called “Burning Noodles”.

The ‘burn’ in burning noodles is a translation for the character ‘ran’ (燃) – which means to light, or to ignite (e.g. the flash point of an oil is referred to as its ‘ran dian’… literally translated, ‘ignition point’). Why ‘ignition noodles’? Well, they’re got the name because… they’re not a soup noodle dish. So much not a soup noodle dish, in fact, you could theoretically take a lighter to them and the noodles would burn in front of you (note: don’t do this, waste of noodles).

Now I know that feels like a hell of a commitment to the concept of ‘not soup noodle’. But you can find this sort of explicitly not-soup noodle dish in old trading towns up and down the middle to upper reaches of the Yangtze river:

1.	[Wuhan, Hot Dry Noodles](https://i.imgur.com/c1tKXua.png).  Wuhan is the last major city right before the three gorges area of the Yangtze river (criminally under-rated food city). One of their most iconic dishes is “hot dry noodles”… the dry referring to the fact that – again – this is not a soup noodle.

2.	[Wanzhou, Zajiang Noodles.](https://i.imgur.com/D9sQGpg.png) Up the river a bit, after the three gorges area – a proper city in its own right, though technically a ‘district’ of Chongqing today. Named so because it was historically place where “a myriad rivers converge and a myriad traders gather” (万川毕汇、万商云集) – though a good chunk of Wanzhou today lies beneath 150 meters of water in the reservoir created by the three gorges dam. One of their famous noodle dishes is called ‘Zajiang Noodle’ (not to be confused with the Northern ‘Zhajiang Noodle’), which’s some dry noodles topped with meat sauce.

3.	[Chongqing, Mala Xiaomian.](https://i.imgur.com/LfYRJYl.png) Historically the focal point of trade in the Sichuan province. Their noodle dish of choice is the fiery xiaomian (‘small noodles’). While historically these noodles were always served dry, today you can find them either dry or in soup.

4.	[Yibin, Burning Noodles.](https://i.imgur.com/7wrLyXO.png) Yibin lies at the Yangtze’s highest navigable point – at the intersection of the Yangtze and the Min river (the latter going up to Leshan – home of the Leshan Giant Buddha – and Chengdu). 

So. Why do all of these places have dry noodles? Even though these cities span three different provinces, they were all *so* influenced by the Yangtze river trade that there’s this… similarity to the cultures there that’s hard to put into words. They’ve all got this… ineffable toughness to them, and these river towns were some of the first in the country to use chili pepper extensively. Some people say that dry noodles were originally popular on the docks because, well, rocky boats aren’t exactly the best place to scarf down a soup noodle. Or perhaps it’s a climate thing. Or maybe, I dunno, they just liked their noodles sans soup for the same reason people in the West generally eat noodles dry – they just… liked them better sometimes. I dunno.

Now of course, this is one of those classic street food sort of dishes, which means its paradoxically (A) simple to serve but (B) time consuming to prep. The way I’d personally sort this logistically would be to sort all of your ingredients in advance (on the weekend or something) and toss them in the fridge. Then the remaining cook time is like… five minutes of work max, so it makes for a great quick snack or an easy dinner, that kind of thing.

So I’ll be splitting this up into three sections. First, ‘stuff to prep in advance’. Second, ‘how to make noodles’ (just in case you’re feeling a Sichuan noodle making project… any sort of alkaline noodle should work ok though). Then lastly, ‘how to make a bowl of burning noodles’. Apologies if this gets confusing – I just was wracking my brain trying to figure out the best way to organize this all so that we could all stay true to the essence of this dish (a quick meal) while still staying true to the flavor.

[Video is here if you’d like a visual to follow along](https://youtu.be/A1y-OhS9z20). I go off on the history a touch again in the beginning there, so jump in at ~ the two minute mark if you want just the recipe.

## Things to prepare in advance for Burning Noodles

Ok, so there’s either three or four things that I think would be convenient to prepare in advance:

* An Yibin-style chili oil called ‘xiangyou’.

* Toasted crushed peanuts.

* Toasted crushed sesame seeds.

* Toasted yacai – pickled and fermented mustard greens.

For those then, you’ll need:

1.	*Dried Sichuan Erjingtiao chilis (二荆条) -or- Arbols, 20g; Dried Heaven Facing Chili (朝天椒) -or- Thai Birds Eye, 10g; or sub in ~1/3 cup of a good chili powder.* So traditionally the chili oil is made with a toasted chili powder – a powder made from a mix of two parts Sichuan erjingtiao chili (a chili that’s roughly as how as cayenne and is known for its vibrant red color) and one part Heaven facing chili (a… quite spicy chili that’s related to and slightly more mild than Thai bird’s eye). Arbols or cayennes are an acceptable sub for Erjingtiao (though you could perhaps add a pinch of Korean chili powder for color if its convenient), Thai bird’s eye is a very close sub for Heaven facing (though Thai bird’s eye *is* hotter, fair warning).

2.	*Sichuan caiziyou (菜籽油) -or- Indian mustard seed oil -or- Peanut oil (花生油), 60g.* So right – like all oil-heavy dishes in the Chinese southwest, Yibin xiangyou relies on a virgin rapeseed oil called Caiziyou. It’s… really really hard to come by in the West (though there’s been some sightings in NYC, and it looks like Mala Market – an online Sichuan ingredient shop – might be getting some in soon). I bring it up not to tease you, but because it’s a foundational flavor. After testing a number of different oils, I found Indian mustard seed oil to be almost indistinguishable after heating it up… close enough to be a direct sub. That said, I know Indian mustard seed oil *also* isn’t exactly a supermarket staple in the West… so barring that, just use peanut oil. Not perfect, but should still taste good.

3.	*Lard (猪油) -or- cooked peanut oil (花生油), 60g.* So after making the chili oil, we’ll be mixing in a good chunk of melted lard. That said, this *is* one of those almost-veg dishes, so if you’re cooking for vegetarians… feel free to swap in cooked peanut oil instead. Basically just heat the peanut oil up til smoke point like we do in the recipe below, **cool it down a bit** and reserve (note: add the peanut oil at, let's say... 80C give or take). Not as authentic as lard, but should still be real nice in the dish. 

4.	*Spices/seasonings for the chili oil: 25g smashed ginger (姜), one whole walnut (带壳核桃), ½ cinnamon stick (桂皮), 2 star anise (八角), 1 tsp Sichuan peppercorn (花椒).* Yep, that one whole walnut – shell and all. Lends a nice earthiness to the chili oil… a real classic in Yibin xiangyou.

5.	 *Peanuts (生花生), 5 tbsp.* We’ll be toasting these, then crushing them. If you’d like, feel free to swap for an equal amount of roasted peanuts in order to skip the toasting process.

6.	*Sesame seeds (白芝麻), 1.5 tbsp.*  We’ll also be toasting and crushing these as well.

7.	*Yacai (芽菜), ~1/2 cup.* So right. The bane of many people in the West attempting to recreate Sichuan dishes – yacai (pickled and fermented mustard greens) is a non-negotiable must here. While not all Asian supermarkets carry it, the good ones do – and [it’s always available extremely overpriced online](https://www.amazon.com/Bin-Sui-Cai-SuiMiYaCai-Vegetable/dp/B01N7T7M4X).

Note that all of these amounts’ll be enough for 4-5 bowls of noodles. Feel free to scale these up if you’d like.

*Process: Chili oil, nuts, and yacai prep:*

Let’s just start with the chili oil because it’s the most intensive. For the chili oil:

1.	*If working from dried chilis, toast for ~5 minutes over medium-low flame.* The chilis’ll be done once they’ve deepened in color and started to smell real nice. As always with toasting chilis though, it’s safer to under toast than over toast.

2.	*Snip the chilis into 2cm sections, keeping the seeds but tossing the stems.*

3.	*Pulse for ~6 minutes in a blender until the chilis are rather fine flakes. Reserve.* You’re looking for a pretty ‘powdery’ chili flake – [something like this](https://i.imgur.com/uepeCo8.png).

4.	*Heat up your 60g of caiziyou (or mustard seed oil, or peanut oil) until it begins to smoke, ~230C. Keep it at that temperature for about 1-2 minutes, then shut off the heat.* Yeah, that’s not a typo – 230C. Heating the oil like this is a must for both Sichuan caiziyou *and* Indian mustard seed oil – doing so’ll significantly reduce the pungency of the oil. Makes peanut oil taste pretty good, too.

5.	*Let the oil cool down to 200-210C, then add in the ginger, the walnut, the Sichuan peppercorn, the cinnamon, and the star anise. Cook for ~5 minutes.* Adding this stuff’ll lower the temperature – not a problem, we’re looking for this to slowly cook at around 150C. If the temperature dips too far below 150C (likely), swap the heat back on to roughly cook at that temperature. It’s fine if it’s a bit variable, but you **do** need it to be at ~150 before the next step.

6.	*Take out some of the clunkier spices, then strain the oil into the chili flakes.* It’ll sizzle in a real satisfying way. Quick stir.

7.	*Melt the lard, then pour it in with the chili oil.* Another quick stir.

And… there you have it. Reserve that stuff, it’s good to use for the burning noodles.

As for everything else?

1.	*Toasted the peanuts over a medium flame for ~12 minutes.* Toast until the peanuts are cooked through and charred on the outside.

2.	*Rub the peanuts with your fingers, then lightly blow off the peels.* Or peel however you feels like, but blowing the peels off is a lot easier than going one by one.

3.	*Put the toasted peanuts in a bag, and light roll over them with a rolling pin or a 24oz beer bottle for ~2 minutes.* A beer bottle is super classic for this lol. Regardless, you want something [about this consistency](https://i.imgur.com/4UVdtSW.png). (Sorry for the blurry pic there)

4.	*Toast the sesame seeds over a medium-low flame for about five minutes.* Or until the sesame seeds start to darken and/or you can hear a couple popping.

5.	*In a mortar -or- with a bag/beer bottle, ever so lightly crush the sesame to get them to release their oil.* Some that [looks about like this](https://i.imgur.com/DghOB5W.png). 

6.	*Soak the yacai in cool water for ~5 minutes.* Doing this will get out their salinity.

7.	*Toast the yacai over a medium-low flame for 1-2 minutes.* Or until dry and just barely beginning to stick to the wok.

Note that we actually didn’t toast our yacai because we… prefer it untoasted. It’s a little sharper and funkier that way. The more proper way is to toast though, so… do that.

## How to Make Sichuan-style Alkaline Noodles

Ok, so again. This is not a must or anything. Want to sub in Japanese ramen noodles? Sure, go for it. But really… any noodle that has a nice bite to it should work fine. Want to use dried spaghetti? I mean… it wouldn’t be the same for sure, but it could still be tasty. Just be sure to cook al dente, and never tell a soul I said it was ok. 

But I do think it’s nice to undertake a noodle project every now and then – if only to help understand what you’re going for, and to guide more informed shopping choices in the future.

It’s also pretty easy in the grand scheme of things. And we’ll be using a pasta maker and a stand mixer to make our life even easier.

*Ingredients, Sichuan-style alkaline noodles:*

1.	*Bread flour -or- Chinese noodle flour (高筋面粉), 300g.* Basically anything with a higher gluten content – we were working with something that was 12.8% protein IIRC.

2.	*Water, 125g.* Or I guess 126 to be exact – we were going with 42% hydration. Note that this’ll make for a really dry dough… and some recipes go even drier than that (we actually saw one that was 38% hydration). 

3.	*Sodium carbonate (碱面), ½ tsp.* So yeah – that’s sodium carbonate, *not* sodium bicarbonate (i.e. baking soda). It’s a much stronger base… sporting a pH of ~11.5 to baking soda’s ~8.5. It’s readily available online, and feel free to sub in Jianshui/Kan Sui/Lye water if that’s more convenient. All of the above inconvenient? Feel free to use the baked baking soda trick – I’ll detail how in the notes below.

*Process, Sichuan style alkaline noodles:*

1.	*Dissolve the sodium carbonate in with the water.* Mix well.

2.	*Slowly add the water/sodium carbonate mixture into the flour, mixing it in bit by bit.* Especially because this’s a pretty dry dough, so doing it bit by bit helps the flour absorb the water more evenly. Aim for the dry parts when tossing in the water. I like mixing in with a single chopstick – less sticky that way.

3.	*Knead for ~8 minutes -or- use a stand mixer with the hook attachment on speed two.* Same ~8 minutes. Especially with the hook attachment, you might find the dough to still be a bit crumbly after eight minutes – no problem at all, just press and knead it together by hand until it all comes together. It’ll still be a bit craggly – no worries. 

4.	*Cover, let it rest for ~30 minutes.*

5.	*Cut the dough in half, then roll it into something that looks vaguely ‘sheet-ish’.* We’ll be working this one half at a time. Rolling it’s just to get it to squeeze into the pasta maker easier.

6.	*Flour the dough and pasta maker, then pass it through at the largest setting. Then do the same at the third smallest setting.*

7.	*Fold the dough ~four times, then slice it with a knife to make noodles.* So two choices here – machine cut or knife cut noodles. If you want your pasta maker to cut them, just uh… cut them. We’re looking for noodles that’re about 2mm wide. You can also cut them by hand too, of course – there’s something about the texture of knife cut noodles that I seem to prefer, but it’s hard to pinpoint what exactly. Either way, you want something that looks [more or less like this](https://i.imgur.com/ktSUbSr.png).

8.	*Pull apart and thoroughly flour the noodles.* Add more flour than you think you might need when flouring them – nothing’s worse than making a bunch of noodles, only to have them end up as one sticky mass.


In an ideal world, eat… soon. But I’ve found these are still quite good even 48-72 hours later too.

## Putting together our Burning Noodles

So in Yibin, in most of the noodle shops you have one of two choices: 100g of noodles (二两) or 150g of noodles (三两). We’ll be assuming a 150g bowl of noodles, mostly just because it feels a bit more substantive to me personally.

*Ingredients, one bowl of burning noodles:*

1.	*Fresh noodles, 150g.*

2.	*Yibin chili oil, 2 tbsp.* I.e. the chili oil from above.

3.	*Light soy sauce (生抽), 1 tsp.*

4.	*Toasted sesame oil, 1 tsp.* Actually most authentic here would be untoasted sesame oil (referred to as ‘white’ sesame oil – 白芝麻油). We used toasted out of laziness in sourcing mostly, but both work great.

5.	*Toasted -or- untoasted yacai (芽菜), 2 tbsp.* So yeah, we actually preferred ours untoasted here. But toasted yacai is more proper, so let that be your default choice.

6.	*Mixed toasted crushed peanuts/sesame, 2 tbsp.*

7.	*Sliced scallion greens (葱), ~2 tbsp.*

8.	*MSG (味精), ¼ tsp -or- chicken bouillon powder (鸡粉), ½ tsp.* Either way – chicken bouillon powder’s basically MSG (well actually usually a mix of disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate given how hyperbolic some Westerns are of MSG) plus some other stuff anyhow. You find see both in Yibin.  

*Process, Burning Noodles:*

Ok, quick aside on equipment. One super classic thing that you’ll see in Yibin are [these things](https://i.imgur.com/tfaiuKs.png) – basically, vendors’ll toss the noodles in after cooking and vigorously strain them in a snapping circular motion. You certainly don’t need to be that obsessive – just do a bang up job straining them. That said, if something conical like a chinois is handy, why not? Just toss the noodles in and snap strain like the vendors do. Plus, you feel all cool doing it.

You don’t want too much time in between straining and doing the initial mix with the liquid ingredients (like, ~60 seconds max), so be sure to have everything handy.

1.	*Cook the noodles until -just- past al dente, ~1 minute.* I usually just time this kind of thing by trying it and seeing what the texture’s like… it ended up being ~1 minute for the fresh alkaline noodles we made above. But don’t take my word for it – if you’re working with a package, go with the package… and even if you’re using the same fresh noodle recipe above, it’s possible that you couldn’t cut your noodles a little thinner or a little thicker. So yeah. Taste the noodles.

2.	*Thoroughly strain the noodes.* It’s really tough to describe this motion… basically you barely lift the strainer up above your shoulder, then snap it down to your waist. Do this 4-5 times and the noodles should be pretty dry. Or alternatively, strain however the hell you feel like – just make sure to move fast so they’re not clumping/sticking on you. 

3.	*Add the liquid ingredients: the chili oil, the soy sauce, the sesame oil.* Give it a thorough mix.

4.	*Top with the rest of the ingredients, then serve.* Mix it all up right before eating.

**Note on how to make sodium carbonate:**

So, why do we even use baking soda in baked goods and such? Well, for two reasons. First is that you can combine it with an acid like cream of tartar and make things puff up in the same way your elementary science fair volcano puffed up. 

Reason two? To make it decompose.

See, at temperatures above 80C, baking soda decomposes and forms (1) water vapor (well, water vapor over 100C of course…) (2) carbon dioxide and (3) sodium carbonate. That CO2 is what the gluten network in your pancakes traps, and what makes them light and airy. But you can take advantage of the same reaction to get your hands on some sodium carbonate, even if it’s not sold at your local supermarket.

Hat tip to Alex the French Guy cooking for this bit, his channel’s where I first heard of this. Just spread some baking soda out on a tray and bake it in a pre-heated oven at 150C for one hour. After that, jar it up and… there’s some sodium carbonate for you. Use it for this recipe, and basically anytime a recipe writer is telling you to use baking soda in order to raise pH (e.g. in Chinese velveting/marinades, the onion browning trick, de-sliming shrimp, etc etc). Sodium carbonate’ll be much stronger, so you’ll need a much smaller quantity, and it won’t alter the final taste of the dish like baking soda sometimes has the tendency to do.",t2_15ve8,False,,0,False,"Recipe: How to make Sichuan Burning Noodles (plus how to make alkaline noodles), 宜宾燃面",[],r/Cooking,False,6,,0,False,t3_ercib1,False,dark,,public,936,2,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,936,,True,,1579567728.0,,[],{'gid_1': 2},,True,,1579551505.0,text,6,,,text,self.Cooking,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I wanted to show you how to make a classic noodle dish from Yibin in the Sichuan province – burning noodles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dried Sichuan Erjingtiao chilis (二荆条) -or- Arbols, 20g; Dried Heaven Facing Chili (朝天椒) -or- Thai Birds Eye, 10g; or sub in ~1/3 cup of a good chili powder.&lt;/em&gt; So traditionally the chili oil is made with a toasted chili powder – a powder made from a mix of two parts Sichuan erjingtiao chili (a chili that’s roughly as how as cayenne and is known for its vibrant red color) and one part Heaven facing chili (a… quite spicy chili that’s related to and slightly more mild than Thai bird’s eye). Arbols or cayennes are an acceptable sub for Erjingtiao (though you could perhaps add a pinch of Korean chili powder for color if its convenient), Thai bird’s eye is a very close sub for Heaven facing (though Thai bird’s eye &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; hotter, fair warning).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sichuan caiziyou (菜籽油) -or- Indian mustard seed oil -or- Peanut oil (花生油), 60g.&lt;/em&gt; So right – like all oil-heavy dishes in the Chinese southwest, Yibin xiangyou relies on a virgin rapeseed oil called Caiziyou. It’s… really really hard to come by in the West (though there’s been some sightings in NYC, and it looks like Mala Market – an online Sichuan ingredient shop – might be getting some in soon). I bring it up not to tease you, but because it’s a foundational flavor. After testing a number of different oils, I found Indian mustard seed oil to be almost indistinguishable after heating it up… close enough to be a direct sub. That said, I know Indian mustard seed oil &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; isn’t exactly a supermarket staple in the West… so barring that, just use peanut oil. Not perfect, but should still taste good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lard (猪油) -or- cooked peanut oil (花生油), 60g.&lt;/em&gt; So after making the chili oil, we’ll be mixing in a good chunk of melted lard. That said, this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; one of those almost-veg dishes, so if you’re cooking for vegetarians… feel free to swap in cooked peanut oil instead. Basically just heat the peanut oil up til smoke point like we do in the recipe below, &lt;strong&gt;cool it down a bit&lt;/strong&gt; and reserve (note: add the peanut oil at, let&amp;#39;s say... 80C give or take). Not as authentic as lard, but should still be real nice in the dish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spices/seasonings for the chili oil: 25g smashed ginger (姜), one whole walnut (带壳核桃), ½ cinnamon stick (桂皮), 2 star anise (八角), 1 tsp Sichuan peppercorn (花椒).&lt;/em&gt; Yep, that one whole walnut – shell and all. Lends a nice earthiness to the chili oil… a real classic in Yibin xiangyou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peanuts (生花生), 5 tbsp.&lt;/em&gt; We’ll be toasting these, then crushing them. If you’d like, feel free to swap for an equal amount of roasted peanuts in order to skip the toasting process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sesame seeds (白芝麻), 1.5 tbsp.&lt;/em&gt;  We’ll also be toasting and crushing these as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yacai (芽菜), ~1/2 cup.&lt;/em&gt; So right. The bane of many people in the West attempting to recreate Sichuan dishes – yacai (pickled and fermented mustard greens) is a non-negotiable must here. While not all Asian supermarkets carry it, the good ones do – and &lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Bin-Sui-Cai-SuiMiYaCai-Vegetable/dp/B01N7T7M4X""&gt;it’s always available extremely overpriced online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that all of these amounts’ll be enough for 4-5 bowls of noodles. Feel free to scale these up if you’d like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Process: Chili oil, nuts, and yacai prep:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s just start with the chili oil because it’s the most intensive. For the chili oil:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If working from dried chilis, toast for ~5 minutes over medium-low flame.&lt;/em&gt; The chilis’ll be done once they’ve deepened in color and started to smell real nice. As always with toasting chilis though, it’s safer to under toast than over toast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Snip the chilis into 2cm sections, keeping the seeds but tossing the stems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pulse for ~6 minutes in a blender until the chilis are rather fine flakes. Reserve.&lt;/em&gt; You’re looking for a pretty ‘powdery’ chili flake – &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/uepeCo8.png""&gt;something like this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heat up your 60g of caiziyou (or mustard seed oil, or peanut oil) until it begins to smoke, ~230C. Keep it at that temperature for about 1-2 minutes, then shut off the heat.&lt;/em&gt; Yeah, that’s not a typo – 230C. Heating the oil like this is a must for both Sichuan caiziyou &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Indian mustard seed oil – doing so’ll significantly reduce the pungency of the oil. Makes peanut oil taste pretty good, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let the oil cool down to 200-210C, then add in the ginger, the walnut, the Sichuan peppercorn, the cinnamon, and the star anise. Cook for ~5 minutes.&lt;/em&gt; Adding this stuff’ll lower the temperature – not a problem, we’re looking for this to slowly cook at around 150C. If the temperature dips too far below 150C (likely), swap the heat back on to roughly cook at that temperature. It’s fine if it’s a bit variable, but you &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; need it to be at ~150 before the next step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take out some of the clunkier spices, then strain the oil into the chili flakes.&lt;/em&gt; It’ll sizzle in a real satisfying way. Quick stir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Melt the lard, then pour it in with the chili oil.&lt;/em&gt; Another quick stir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And… there you have it. Reserve that stuff, it’s good to use for the burning noodles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for everything else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toasted the peanuts over a medium flame for ~12 minutes.&lt;/em&gt; Toast until the peanuts are cooked through and charred on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rub the peanuts with your fingers, then lightly blow off the peels.&lt;/em&gt; Or peel however you feels like, but blowing the peels off is a lot easier than going one by one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Put the toasted peanuts in a bag, and light roll over them with a rolling pin or a 24oz beer bottle for ~2 minutes.&lt;/em&gt; A beer bottle is super classic for this lol. Regardless, you want something &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/4UVdtSW.png""&gt;about this consistency&lt;/a&gt;. (Sorry for the blurry pic there)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toast the sesame seeds over a medium-low flame for about five minutes.&lt;/em&gt; Or until the sesame seeds start to darken and/or you can hear a couple popping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a mortar -or- with a bag/beer bottle, ever so lightly crush the sesame to get them to release their oil.&lt;/em&gt; Some that &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/DghOB5W.png""&gt;looks about like this&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soak the yacai in cool water for ~5 minutes.&lt;/em&gt; Doing this will get out their salinity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toast the yacai over a medium-low flame for 1-2 minutes.&lt;/em&gt; Or until dry and just barely beginning to stick to the wok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that we actually didn’t toast our yacai because we… prefer it untoasted. It’s a little sharper and funkier that way. The more proper way is to toast though, so… do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to Make Sichuan-style Alkaline Noodles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so again. This is not a must or anything. Want to sub in Japanese ramen noodles? Sure, go for it. But really… any noodle that has a nice bite to it should work fine. Want to use dried spaghetti? I mean… it wouldn’t be the same for sure, but it could still be tasty. Just be sure to cook al dente, and never tell a soul I said it was ok. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do think it’s nice to undertake a noodle project every now and then – if only to help understand what you’re going for, and to guide more informed shopping choices in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also pretty easy in the grand scheme of things. And we’ll be using a pasta maker and a stand mixer to make our life even easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ingredients, Sichuan-style alkaline noodles:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bread flour -or- Chinese noodle flour (高筋面粉), 300g.&lt;/em&gt; Basically anything with a higher gluten content – we were working with something that was 12.8% protein IIRC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Water, 125g.&lt;/em&gt; Or I guess 126 to be exact – we were going with 42% hydration. Note that this’ll make for a really dry dough… and some recipes go even drier than that (we actually saw one that was 38% hydration). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sodium carbonate (碱面), ½ tsp.&lt;/em&gt; So yeah – that’s sodium carbonate, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; sodium bicarbonate (i.e. baking soda). It’s a much stronger base… sporting a pH of ~11.5 to baking soda’s ~8.5. It’s readily available online, and feel free to sub in Jianshui/Kan Sui/Lye water if that’s more convenient. All of the above inconvenient? Feel free to use the baked baking soda trick – I’ll detail how in the notes below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Process, Sichuan style alkaline noodles:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dissolve the sodium carbonate in with the water.&lt;/em&gt; Mix well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slowly add the water/sodium carbonate mixture into the flour, mixing it in bit by bit.&lt;/em&gt; Especially because this’s a pretty dry dough, so doing it bit by bit helps the flour absorb the water more evenly. Aim for the dry parts when tossing in the water. I like mixing in with a single chopstick – less sticky that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knead for ~8 minutes -or- use a stand mixer with the hook attachment on speed two.&lt;/em&gt; Same ~8 minutes. Especially with the hook attachment, you might find the dough to still be a bit crumbly after eight minutes – no problem at all, just press and knead it together by hand until it all comes together. It’ll still be a bit craggly – no worries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cover, let it rest for ~30 minutes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cut the dough in half, then roll it into something that looks vaguely ‘sheet-ish’.&lt;/em&gt; We’ll be working this one half at a time. Rolling it’s just to get it to squeeze into the pasta maker easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flour the dough and pasta maker, then pass it through at the largest setting. Then do the same at the third smallest setting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fold the dough ~four times, then slice it with a knife to make noodles.&lt;/em&gt; So two choices here – machine cut or knife cut noodles. If you want your pasta maker to cut them, just uh… cut them. We’re looking for noodles that’re about 2mm wide. You can also cut them by hand too, of course – there’s something about the texture of knife cut noodles that I seem to prefer, but it’s hard to pinpoint what exactly. Either way, you want something that looks &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/ktSUbSr.png""&gt;more or less like this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pull apart and thoroughly flour the noodles.&lt;/em&gt; Add more flour than you think you might need when flouring them – nothing’s worse than making a bunch of noodles, only to have them end up as one sticky mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, eat… soon. But I’ve found these are still quite good even 48-72 hours later too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Putting together our Burning Noodles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in Yibin, in most of the noodle shops you have one of two choices: 100g of noodles (二两) or 150g of noodles (三两). We’ll be assuming a 150g bowl of noodles, mostly just because it feels a bit more substantive to me personally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ingredients, one bowl of burning noodles:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fresh noodles, 150g.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yibin chili oil, 2 tbsp.&lt;/em&gt; I.e. the chili oil from above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Light soy sauce (生抽), 1 tsp.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toasted sesame oil, 1 tsp.&lt;/em&gt; Actually most authentic here would be untoasted sesame oil (referred to as ‘white’ sesame oil – 白芝麻油). We used toasted out of laziness in sourcing mostly, but both work great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toasted -or- untoasted yacai (芽菜), 2 tbsp.&lt;/em&gt; So yeah, we actually preferred ours untoasted here. But toasted yacai is more proper, so let that be your default choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mixed toasted crushed peanuts/sesame, 2 tbsp.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sliced scallion greens (葱), ~2 tbsp.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MSG (味精), ¼ tsp -or- chicken bouillon powder (鸡粉), ½ tsp.&lt;/em&gt; Either way – chicken bouillon powder’s basically MSG (well actually usually a mix of disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate given how hyperbolic some Westerns are of MSG) plus some other stuff anyhow. You find see both in Yibin.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Process, Burning Noodles:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, quick aside on equipment. One super classic thing that you’ll see in Yibin are &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/tfaiuKs.png""&gt;these things&lt;/a&gt; – basically, vendors’ll toss the noodles in after cooking and vigorously strain them in a snapping circular motion. You certainly don’t need to be that obsessive – just do a bang up job straining them. That said, if something conical like a chinois is handy, why not? Just toss the noodles in and snap strain like the vendors do. Plus, you feel all cool doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t want too much time in between straining and doing the initial mix with the liquid ingredients (like, ~60 seconds max), so be sure to have everything handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cook the noodles until -just- past al dente, ~1 minute.&lt;/em&gt; I usually just time this kind of thing by trying it and seeing what the texture’s like… it ended up being ~1 minute for the fresh alkaline noodles we made above. But don’t take my word for it – if you’re working with a package, go with the package… and even if you’re using the same fresh noodle recipe above, it’s possible that you couldn’t cut your noodles a little thinner or a little thicker. So yeah. Taste the noodles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thoroughly strain the noodes.&lt;/em&gt; It’s really tough to describe this motion… basically you barely lift the strainer up above your shoulder, then snap it down to your waist. Do this 4-5 times and the noodles should be pretty dry. Or alternatively, strain however the hell you feel like – just make sure to move fast so they’re not clumping/sticking on you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Add the liquid ingredients: the chili oil, the soy sauce, the sesame oil.&lt;/em&gt; Give it a thorough mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Top with the rest of the ingredients, then serve.&lt;/em&gt; Mix it all up right before eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note on how to make sodium carbonate:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why do we even use baking soda in baked goods and such? Well, for two reasons. First is that you can combine it with an acid like cream of tartar and make things puff up in the same way your elementary science fair volcano puffed up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reason two? To make it decompose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, at temperatures above 80C, baking soda decomposes and forms (1) water vapor (well, water vapor over 100C of course…) (2) carbon dioxide and (3) sodium carbonate. That CO2 is what the gluten network in your pancakes traps, and what makes them light and airy. But you can take advantage of the same reaction to get your hands on some sodium carbonate, even if it’s not sold at your local supermarket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hat tip to Alex the French Guy cooking for this bit, his channel’s where I first heard of this. Just spread some baking soda out on a tray and bake it in a pre-heated oven at 150C for one hour. After that, jar it up and… there’s some sodium carbonate for you. Use it for this recipe, and basically anytime a recipe writer is telling you to use baking soda in order to raise pH (e.g. in Chinese velveting/marinades, the onion browning trick, de-sliming shrimp, etc etc). Sodium carbonate’ll be much stronger, so you’ll need a much smaller quantity, and it won’t alter the final taste of the dish like baking soda sometimes has the tendency to do.&lt;/p&gt;

,Cooking,"[Here's the finished product!](https://imgur.com/KW8nMPF) I made the pasta from scratch with my new pasta roller. It was a lot of fun!

[This is the recipe I used.](https://www.prouditaliancook.com/2019/11/four-cheese-ravioli-with-herb-embedded-pasta.html?m) I pretty much followed the recipe for everything, except I added the zest of one meyer lemon, which helped cut through the richness of all the cheese. 

This recipe didn't include a topping, but I went with a classic and simple [brown butter.](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/how-to-brown-butter/) 

For the topping, I toasted up some pine nuts and gave them a rough chop. I had plenty of parsley and sage left over from the dough, so I minced those very finely. I sprinkled both on top, then added some more lemon zest and parmesan.

,Cooking,"Oyster artichoke soup was a special part of my childhood in New Orleans. Every Christmas, the whole family would get together at my grandparents’ house. My grandfather spent all day making the soup from scratch. It was fantastic.  

After my grandfather died, I asked my mother and her siblings for the recipe. None of them had it, but my mother had her own version that tasted exactly like my grandfather’s. However, my mom made the soup from canned and frozen ingredients.  

I have tried many, many different recipes for oyster artichoke soup, but none of them come close to this one. I would really rather make it from scratch, like my grandfather did, but I don’t have the recipe.  

My mom’s recipe follows. If any of you good folks have suggestions as to how I could deconstruct and recreate my grandfather’s recipe from this one, I’d really appreciate the help!  

&gt; 
&gt; **Oyster Artichoke Soup**  
&gt; *Ingredients:*
&gt; 
&gt; * 2 pints oysters with juice
&gt; * 5 cans artichoke quarters (remove tough parts)
&gt; * 2 bags frozen chopped onions, celery and peppers
&gt; * 4 tbsp flour
&gt; * 4 tbsp butter
&gt; * 2 cans condensed mushroom soup
&gt; * 2 cans condensed celery soup
&gt; * 2 cans condensed cheddar cheese soup
&gt; * 2 cans mushrooms, stems and pieces
&gt; 
&gt; *Directions*  
&gt; Heat the butter in a large, heavy-bottom pot. Add the flour and stir to make a blond roux. Add vegetables and cook until wilted. Add artichokes and mushrooms. Cook for about 15 minutes. Add all soups and heat through. Do not allow to come to a boil. If the mixture is too thick, add cream or half and half, a little at a time. Do not add milk, as it will curdle. Add oysters and their liquor. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve.  

FWIW, the beginning steps - making a roux and cooking the trinity (onions, celery, peppers) - are classic starting steps for many Creole dishes. I think the issue comes in with the canned soups.

,Cooking,"I'm sitting here eating a really really good bowl of ramen.  It's so good.  And it reminds me of a conversation I had with a friend of mine some time ago where we both agreed that learning how to cook has been one of the greatest benefits in our respective lives.  Being able to put ingredients together and turn out something that you like, and maybe even other people like, is simply *joy.*  Not being limited to what restaurants you can find is *freedom* and I am so so grateful for having learned this skill.

If I could thank people, I'd have to thank just a whole host of chefs who have had cooking shows that I have devoured relentlessly for decades.  The first cooking show I ever remember watching as a kid was [The Frugal Gourmet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfigPIvycCc) (Jeff Smith) on PBS.  After that Food Network took off and I definitely ate up Emeril, Alton Brown, Mario Batali and others.  On the internet I continue to follow Chef John at Food Wishes,  Adam Ragusea, Alex at French Guy Cooking and all the wonderful folks over at the Bon Apetit Test Kitchen.  Without all of these inspirations in my life, I'd still be eating macaroni and cheese out of a box probably.

Anyway, if you're unsure, just starting out, have no idea what you're doing or are afraid of 'screwing up' in the kitchen, I have to say: just do it.  Just keep cooking, screw things up, learn from your mistakes.  It's so rewarding in the end, I promise.

As for my ramen, this is what I do to make it fantastic:

1) Throw away that stupid packet of 'flavor' they put in there.  It's worthless.  Get yourself some Better Than Bullion in whatever flavor you like (there are several).  It's infinitely superior.

2)  Sear off some chicken breasts and finish them in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes or so.

3) stir fry some veggies and just put them in a bowl to wait for now.  I use carrots, broccoli and onions.

4) On top of those veggies in that bowl, put the following: soy sauce (amount to taste), sriracha (ditto), fresh garlic, and freshly grated ginger.  All of this can sit for a few minutes marinating it's fine.

5) Use the pasta water to dissolve the bullion and just dump all of that over your noodles and veggies.  The broth will form instantly and take on a deep, rich color and you'll be able to smell that ginger throughout the house.  It's wonderful.

6) Top with chicken breasts, cut on the bias.  Finish with some cilantro or scallion or even a couple soft boiled eggs if you want.

Obviously this isn't a complicated recipe or particularly inventive, but it's just great and something I would never have dreamed of doing before I really got into cooking.

,Cooking,"I apologize if this isn't super appropriate for the sub. I read the rules and thought I fit in them, I can delete if not. 

I went hunting with a buddy this weekend and shot a snow goose, and decided to just throw a brunch skillet together. It came out WAY better than I expected and I wanted to share with y'all. Detailed recipe below, but first, Imgur link to the finished tastiness:

https://imgur.com/gallery/QP1bq0k

Okay so recipe-ish. I don't cook with specific measurements all the time, I just kind of feel it out most of the time.

1) The night before your brunch, clean your goose breast fillets (I just used one for this one shared meal). Combine goose breasts in a plastic bag with 1/3 measure each of: Sriracha, Worcestershire sauce, and Sweet Chili Sauce (I used Frank's Kickin' Garlic Sauce in a substitution), where the marinade mixture just covers the goose in the bag. Cool and let it marinate over night (you don't have to do it overnight, just give it an hour or more if you're in a hurry).

2) Half-ish of a bag of frozen breakfast hasbrowns (the shredded kind). I cooked those in the vegetable oil the bag suggested, and added some pepper and garlic seasoning after they'd cooked a bit and I was stirring for the first time. Finish them and set them to the side.

3) Heat a cast iron skillet with a small amount (maybe 2TBSP tops) of Grapeseed Oil on high, until just before your oil smokes. Sear your goose breast to preference. I like my wild game cooked to rare/medium rare if it's able to be safely consumed that way, so I really just did 2.5 minutes on each side, and left it in the hot skillet while I tidied my workspace a bit. I discarded the used marinade, but if you wanted you could heat it up on the stove to a boil and reduce it to make a nice spicy glaze during this time.

4) Remove your goose breast from the skillet, put it on a cutting board to rest. Add the hash brown potatoes to the cast iron and use a spoon or spatula to stir them in the leftover stuck on stuff, oil, and juices from your searing.

5) In a separate pan, put about 2TBSP of butter to melt on medium, then fry two eggs over easy, adding a small amount of pepper and garlic powder, to taste.

6) Slice your goose to preferred thickness, lay it on the potatoes, add your eggs, and drizzle either your glaze you chose to make or sprinkle Cholula on top.

It came out way better than expected, and my buddy actually commented that ""I would never be disappointed if a fancy brunch place brought this meal to me."" 

I love wild game and this recipe actually offered very little of the game-y taste I expected, probably because of the overnight marinade. If you have any tips to offer to make it better or enhance this meal, please let me know! Thanks!

The only changes I would make is to hold off on the eggs until you've added the salt/pepper, so that you can add enough to taste, and that it's easier to scoop them out with a spoon, roll into a ball, gently pat down flat, and *then* put them in the pan.

3 eggs, lightly whisked

3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

1 cup Panko

2 cups fresh spinach, sliced thin

a couple of good pinches of salt and pepper

6-8 tablespoons olive oil, divided, for frying (use more or less based on your preference)

 

1. Add ricotta, eggs, Parmesan cheese, panko, salt and pepper to a large bowl. Stir gently until just combined. Fold spinach into mixture.
2. Drizzle about a tablespoon or two of olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat and spread around. Scoop a heaping tablespoon of ricotta and spinach mixture into hot oil and gently push down with spoon to spread and flatten just a bit, this helps them all cook up evenly. Repeat with as many spoonfuls as fit in your pan (I made 5 - 6 per batch).

,Cooking,"This is something that is used constantly in professional kitchens but I never really see used in home kitchens (at least in the West). It is incredibly easy to make and store, and will absolutely transform your sauteeing/high heat cooking. 


To make it, simply add butter to a sauce pan- the size depends on how much clarified butter you want to make. I wouldn't do anything less than a pound, but I recommend you do a couple pounds - it lasts longer than whole butter because of the lack of milk solids so it won't go bad. Melt the butter down, and using a spoon, ladle off the white solids. You could either pour the butter through a fine mesh sieve with some cheese cloth to separate the butter from the solids at the bottom, or you can just ladle the butter out carefully (I recommend doing this).


To take it a step further and make ghee, simply cook the butter longer until the milk solids start to brown and the butter smells slightly nutty, and then strain.


The biggest advantage to using clarified butter is it's smoke point. It has a smoke point of around 450F (232C), which is around the same as corn and peanut oil, is higher than canola oil (400F, 205C), and much higher than extra virgin olive oil (330F, 166C) and whole butter (350F, 176C) This means you can get your pan hotter, allowing you to get harder sears on your food.


Another advantage, obviously, is flavor. I'm sure I dont need to tell you that butter tastes amazing, and is much preferable to vegetable/canola oil. You can use it exactly how you would use any other cooking oil, but some suggestions:


-Sauteeing veggies


-Eggs - great for getting a crispy over easy egg


-Use it for searing meats


-Poach shrimp in it


-Making hollandaise. If anyone is interested in an awesome hollandaise recipe, just let me know. It's the one I was taught at my culinary school and developed by the CIA. This post is long enough as it is, though, so I don't want to make it any longer.

,Cooking,"For those who have cast iron grates on their stove top gas range, how do you care for them?

I ask because I have a oven/range that is only about 6 months old, and I am seeing what looks to be wearing down of the black seasoning (?) or top layer on the grates. In parts of the grate, the black color looks to be wearing off and exposing a silver layer of the grate. I think this comes from shifting pots and pans on top of the surface.

Should I be seasoning these grates like I do my cast iron pans?  If so, how should I go about that?  I should note that the grates have some little rubber feet on them so they lay softly on the surface of the range.  So I think putting them in the oven is out of the question.

Any help is appreciated!

As for the context, I am 19 year old and decided that it'd really be time to pick up cooking, but I'm not really sure on where to start.

I still live at my mom's house as I'm still in school, and there's no real benefit of me moving out since it's fairly close to where my mom lives, and because of this reason I've pretty much relied on my mom's cooking until now. 

For school, I'll have to do an intern for \~4 months straight, which will be in a foreign country. This will start in late august, however, I have never really cooked apart from some eggs and simple pasta. I talked about it with my mom and she said that I could start cooking a bit for myself, and that she'd be there while I cooked to help me out and what not, but I had to come up with a list of dishes I'd like to be able to cook and whatnot.

The intern will be in Hungary, and I currently live in the Netherlands, if this matters for some reason regarding the recommendations.

&amp;#x200B;

,Cooking,"Hi, maybe someone knows about this, its hard to explain, there i go:

When i make my own version of kung pao chicken, I cut chicken breasts and make a marinade with soy sauce, mirim (or another acidic solution), and spices, garlic ginger and so on, nothing special, is in almost every Asian recipe and the target is to add flavor to the chicken.

After I cook it, another thing happens, it's like magic, the texture changes, and this new texture is an absolute miracle. I don't know how to describe, its more gummy, smooth, cant sense the fibers in the meat.

And my doubt always is why? why does this happens? is the soy sauce? the chilling? the rehidratation of the meat? the acidic ingredients on the marinade? or the sudden change of temperature when I throw it on the flaming hot wok?

And then, a couple days ago, I saw a video where i learned a technique called **brine** first time i ear about it (its not popular here in Argentina) they drown the chicken in salty water overnight, apparently by osmosis an interchange of fluids happens and the chicken gets more salty and less dry when you cook it on the even, french technique i guess.

I am thinking now that this is what happens with the soy marinade every time! am i right?

Maybe I could even make red meat smoother without changing the flavor!.

This was literally the best roast chicken I've ever done, and the breast meat was so incredibly moist. Holy crap! And it was so easy!

Preheat oven to 425, line a sheet pan with parchment.

Halve small golden potatoes, slice onions and carrots (I didn't have carrots last night but will the next time), toss with a little olive oil  and salt and pepper and add to sheet pan in a single layer.  You could also add garlic and fresh herbs to the veg.

Flip the bird over and, using kitchen shears, cut along both sides of the spine to remove it.  Then, using a sharp knife, score the breast bone.  Place bird breast side up on top of the veg and press down on the breast bone until it breaks to flatten everything out. 

Brush skin with olive oil and season with salt and pepper and put in the middle rack of the oven. Cook for 45 minute and then check doneness with an instant read thermometer in the breast/thigh, sticking it back in for a few minutes if it's not 165.

&lt;p&gt;Brush skin with olive oil and season with salt and pepper and put in the middle rack of the oven. Cook for 45 minute and then check doneness with an instant read thermometer in the breast/thigh, sticking it back in for a few minutes if it&amp;#39;s not 165. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was so easy and so good.  &lt;/p&gt;

,Cooking,"I'm having to remodel my kitchen due to a slab water leak. Insurance has ripped the whole kitchen out and now I have the opportunity to reimagine it the way I want. The only problem is we don't have 220 volt electric. We have two gas lines as our former appliances where a gas cooktop and a small 24 inch gas oven. We hated the 24-inch one and referred to it as the Easy-Bake oven because it couldn't even fit a cookie sheet. The electrical panel is opposite side of the house from the kitchen and is completely full. It's pretty old so we would probably need to update it in order to add a new 220 volt dedicated circuit. It would be very expensive to run the lines through the whole house to the kitchen as we don't have an attic since we have second floor. I've been kind of toying with the idea of getting a refurbished 48 in professional grade gas range and oven like a thermador, wolf or Viking.

Insurance has ripped the whole kitchen out and now I have the opportunity to reimagine it the way I want. The only problem is we don&amp;#39;t have 220 volt electric. We have two gas lines as our former appliances where a gas cooktop and a small 24 inch gas oven. We hated the 24-inch one and referred to it as the Easy-Bake oven because it couldn&amp;#39;t even fit a cookie sheet. The electrical panel is opposite side of the house from the kitchen and is completely full. It&amp;#39;s pretty old so we would probably need to update it in order to add a new 220 volt dedicated circuit. It would be very expensive to run the lines through the whole house to the kitchen as we don&amp;#39;t have an attic since we have second floor. I&amp;#39;ve been kind of toying with the idea of getting a refurbished 48 in professional grade gas range and oven like a thermador, wolf or Viking.

I have wanted to put Beyond ground ""beef"" to the test with Bolognese sauce for a long time, and yesterday I decided to do it. On the blog/recipe sphere, I see a lot of vegetarian and vegan adaptations of Bolognese and the vast majority tend to go off the rails with unnecessary ingredients (well, less unnecessary if vegan) and preparation methods. The question I wanted to answer was, ""Can a classic Bolognese recipe taste comparable when swapped with plant-based meat?""

The very short answer is yes, and I'm sure it would be fine if the *only* adjustment you made was swapping the meat. However - there are two main problems I notice when cooking with plant based ground beef: fat rendering and rich flavor. If you ever scan the back of a Beyond Beef package, the macronutrient composition is almost identical to 80/20 ground beef. Texturally, the stuff definitely holds up. 

To compensate for the fat rendering (or lack thereof) as well as rich flavor I made three adjustments to Marcella's recipe:

* One clove of garlic, very finely minced, added at the end of soffritto sweating. This decision was less about adding garlic to the overall flavor profile than intensifying the other flavors in the dish, which I find garlic does very well in small quantities.

* When sauteeing the Beyond beef, I added three tbsp of tomato paste. If you've ever eaten Beyond beef, it has a faint coconut flavor. Adding tomato early, especially paste, was an attempt to block that flavor note from overpowering the more delicate soffritto, as well as adding some of that glutamate goodness early. Also - I found the tomato paste helped make the soffritto and beef juicier as it broke down in the pot, potentially compensating for some of the loss of fat rendering.

* Speaking of glutamates, I added one medium sized parmesan rind with the 1 1/2 cup of tomatoes just before simmering. I know some new age Bolognese recipes call for fish sauce (Kenji) and other umami boosters, but I wanted to preserve Marcella's recipe as carefully as possible. That meant not just throwing in any flavor enhancer I could think of. 

I served with penne because I didn't have any tagliatelle, so you could say that alone made this a bastardized ragù ;) 

Overall - a delicious meal, served alongside a simple mâche green salad dressed with a lemon vinaigrette to cut through some of the sauce's richness. I'd recommend this plant-based adaptation for anyone looking to experiment with some classics while reducing their carbon footprint.

&lt;p&gt;4 egg yolks
Half a lime squeezed (didnt have a lemon, so improvised)
Chili powder( didnt have cayenne lol)
Half a cup of melted salted butter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I did improvise some ingredients, maybe this did it for me? These caused a slightly different taste? I thought it was an alright first attempt, but ready to perfect it!&lt;/p&gt;

,Cooking,"Hey folks! My mother's electric skillet is dying and terrible and we want to get her a new one. We were chatting about the perfect skillet for her and wondering if it even exists. So, if you have or know of an electric skillet that fits the following list and works great, please share! Price doesn't matter for a good piece of equipment.

- Rectangular, and large enough to cook six pancakes at once (current skillet is roughly 12"" x 15"", bigger would be better)

- deep walls for large dishes

- skillet detaches from electric heating unit for easy cleaning

- even distribution of heat

The skillet detaching is the big one. We're looking on the Google too of course, but finding something so specific is hard and I'd like to hear from people who have actually used and can recommend an item.
