Cooking,"I have been learning how to cook over the past year. people tell me I have gotten pretty good at it. my fiance' is super appreciative and loves everything i cook. problem is, i hate everything i cook. i find it repulsive. it could be the best tasting thing i've ever made, and i'd have no interest in it. it's starting to depress me, because i spend so much time and money on these dishes that my fiance' will eat from for days, and all i can do is watch him eat it. when i finally go out of my mind from hunger, ill just go to McDonalds and eat chicken nuggets. if my mom or someone else makes food, i'll usually enjoy it. i just can't seem to get past this psychological barrier and i've never been more unhealthy and hungry in my life.

has anyone else ever experienced something like this?"
Cooking,"Maybe this is about cooking. Maybe not. Since cooking is such a personal emotional thing for many of us I'll take the risk. Let me know if this doesn't belong here.

I have said the final farewell to all of my grandparents and my parents. When they died we all sorted through their belongings and chose a few things to keep. Most of my selections were from the kitchen. My mom's mom provided a pastry blender. My dad's mom a little screen sieve. My mom provided a few items, the most special to me is a little aluminum measuring cup that she always had in the flour canister. Lots of memories came along for the ride with that measuring cup. It is now in my flour canister and I think of her every time I use it. It is still usually painful nearly three years later but I will always keep it in the canister. Tonight it was eggplant parmesan and the breading needed some flour. I both hate and cherish using it and am missing her a lot right now. I wish I could post a photo of that simple measuring cup in this text only sub; you'll just have to imagine it.

If there's a point to this post I suppose it is to encourage everyone to cherish and make time for the important things in life with people and cooking being at the top of the list.

EDIT I totally forgot about imgur. Thx for the reminder u/drunky_crowette.

Here's a link to a pic of the aforementioned measuring cup:  https://imgur.com/gallery/4Tqq5De

EDIT2 it seems cliche but I really did not expect such a big response to this post. I have two general comments. First, there must have been a really successful ad campaign mamy decades ago that persuaded the mothers of the day to use this specific cup for flour. I can't believe how many commenters have stated they have the exact same cup in their flour. Second, I suppose awards and karma are nice, but what is most meaningful to me is how this post has connected so deeply with so many people and in some cases helped them move forward a bit in their grieving process. It has been healing for me to see that happen. ❤"
Cooking,I typically save several dollars every trip to the grocery store. What name brand do you refuse to substitute for store brand?
Cooking,"I eat a lot of steamed vegetables, particularly broccoli, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, and asparagus. It is fast, healthy, and doesn't heat up my apartment in the spring and summer (I do more roasting in the colder months). 
Usually I just finish them with a bit of olive oil, salt, and pepper, but this gets old. Any ideas?"
Cooking,I currently own both a Crock Pot and an Instant Pot but am looking to declutter and considering selling the Crock Pot. Is there anything that the slow cooker can do that an Instant Pot can’t? Any reason for me to keep both? TIA!
Cooking,"Hi all, a couple of hours ago I opened a can of Aldi supermarket tomatoes, and after breaking the seal by half an inch, the tomatoes exploded upwards, with a white fizz everywhere. The fizzing continued for about two minutes and has now settled. Obviously I haven’t consumed any, and had a shower to try and get any off me. What are the chances this was caused by the bacteria that produced botulism? And if so what are the chances of serious repercussions having not consumed any?

Thanks in advance"

Cooking,"It's winter where I live. Cold weather and grey skies make up most days. I've been finding myself drinking too much coffee as of late and never feel like drinking tea. However, I'm very rarely not in the mood for a spicy, warm cup of chai tea. The thing is that I'm not too crazy about most store-bought brands of chai.

I decided to take matters into my own hands and make my own with spices from my kitchen. I've been doing it for a while now and figured I share how I do it with the world. I'll post the recipe below and a link to a how-to video for my visual-first people. Cheers!

Cooking,"I stopped eating meat about 2 years ago and I'm completely happy with my decision. To get more protein, I've tried to incorporate more tofu into my diet, but I just can't stand the taste.

Usually people say tofu doesn't have a taste at all, but that's not the case for the tofu I've cooked. I'd be completely happy if it had no taste, because then you can completely change the flavour by marinating it differently. But for me, it just tastes bad. 

Am I just weird? Are there other people that just can't stand the taste? Did I just buy the wrong kind of tofu? 

I tried different cooking methods, I've fried it in oil, I've pan fried it, I've baked it, I marinated it with different things, and I was actually really impressed by how much you can change the texture and how much flavour you can pack in there, but the 'tofu taste' that J hatte still remained."
Cooking,I’m making my first ever batch of home made pasta and the dough is currently resting so I have 30 minutes to decide which will go better with home made pesto. They’re the only attachments I have for my pasta crank so which should I go with?
Cooking,"I've always been confused by the ""classic"" way of cooking pasta: Using lots of water, making it as salty as the sea, and then setting a bit of cooking water aside for adding it to the sauce. For me it made no sense. So I came up with my own way of cooking pasta. 

1) Using far less water. All noodles have to be covered of course, but adding a lot more has no benefits. They won't stick together if you stir from time to time. By using less water, you get a higher concentration of starches.

2) Not salting the water for the first 5 minutes (that is, if you use normal noodles with a cooking time of about 10 min) and reserving some of the UNSALTED pasta water. 5 min are enough for the salt to penetrate the noodles, you won't taste any difference. 

3) Adding most of the unsalted pasta water before and letting it further reduce in the sauce; this again increases the starch concentration. Still don't use all of your reserved water so you can regulate the consistency of the pasta with the sauce later, dry pasta is BAD."
Cooking,"Hello!

One of my most favorite recipes is [this fettuccine alfredo](https://www.recipetineats.com/one-pot-chicken-alfredo-pasta/)!
I make it for family and friends a lot, and they all really love it!

The biggest issue that I have though, is that the sauce isn’t creamy like traditional alfredo. Instead, it looks a bit like cottage cheese and causes the pasta to stick together a bit.
I’ve made this recipe hundreds of times, and it always turns out the same...

Is there anything that I could be doing differently in order to make the sauce more creamy? Or is this just how it’s supposed to look?
Thank you for the advice! It tastes delicious either way! :)"
Cooking,"About 5 or 6 years ago, I made some lamb rogan josh and ended up with far too much leftover spice rub. I didn't want to throw it all away, so I stuck it in a ziploc and labelled it. The problem is, rogan josh is not something I make often, so it sat there for a while until I started incorporating it in other dishes. Over the years, I've dipped into it and added things back in so often that I have zero idea of what is in there anymore, but it is many generations past anything resembling rogan josh.

I started doing this for convenience and thriftiness, but I feel like it has helped me become a better chef (even if the practice isn't very chef-like). Every time I'm considering using it, I'll smell the bag and try to figure out what's in it, and decide whether it will complement my dish or if I should add any leftover seasoning into it.

Am I the only one who does this? Do you consider this poor practice? What would you guess is in your mystery blend?"

Cooking,"Fir Christmas my mother gave my kids a bunch of ""easy menu ethnic cookbooks"" a library was getting rid of.  They are great and kid friendly.  We tried the Cooking the Italian way last week and it was a huge hit.  We went all out made a 4 course meal and broke out the fancy dishes and came as close as I was able to create a true Italian table.  I would love to give the Japanese culture as much accuracy as I can as well, but I have much less experience with Japan and its culture.

We have a large low coffee table and I figure i can get us some pillows to sit on.  I ordered some chop sticks, I know they wont be able to use them, but figured it would be fun to try.   It says to use a variety of small dishes, I am a bit of a china ware horder, so that is doable.

The author of the book did not give me a simple menu, she says to just pick some of each category and chose thing with different flavors, but I really do not know what each food is going to taste like.  The menu I am going with so far is: 

Green tea, I cannot get loose leaf here

Basic Clear soup, I ordered Dashinomoto (this will be completely new) (O-sumashi)

Sesame seed dressing with Broccoli (Groma-ae)

Rice

Chicken in a Pot (Mitzutaki)  with soy sause/lemon for dipping and chives, ginger root for garnish

Anyone on here from Japan? Or of Japanese decent? Can you tell me if this is a close example of what might be ate during a nice meal with family?  Is there anything I might add (way out in the middle of no where, so it will be hard to get much but I would be happy to know for maybe next time)  My kids range from 7 to 2, but only the 7 yr is really picky, she will eat the chicken plain.
Oh and because the book does not specify, do you usually put out all the food at once? Or do you do courses?"

Cooking,"Hello, I'm on my second attempt on making sourdough starters.

On both my attempts, I start with 20gr water 20gr flour on day one, discard about half and add 40gr water and 40gr flour on day two, and keep adding about 1tbsp flour and water every morning


The first one fails after about day 5, with about 3ml layer of hooch, smells bad (vomit inducing) , and almost no sign of bubbling. Granted I didn't know it was hooch and that you need to discard it. I threw attempt one since I can't revive it. 

My current batch (attempt two): on day one there's a little bit of clear water layer after 12h.I just stir it back in. On day two, about 6h after feeding it triples in size! On day three, I notice it looks like it's not active. when I open the jar, I can feel the air rising up to be quite warm, which I thought must be normal. There's a little bit hooch, and it smells like acetone (which worries me) . I discard the hooch and the top layer of the starter, added 40gr flour and 40gr water, and about 6h later, there's almost no change in size, with a little bit hooch. It smells acetone, but doesn't feel vomity

For the first time ever I bought some imported red rice and tried cooking it the same way I always do with Thai rice:

- put rice in a glass container

- add water until covering everything
- add seasoning
- mix everything
- put inside a vapor cooker

Recently decided to try something different and make a French onion soup (almost an hour of stirring onions just to prep, shoot me). Turned out great except for one thing. It was really sweet. I'm not a big fan of sweet things. No French onion soup I've ever had before was sweet like that.

Now I'm looking to you amazing people to help me out. Was it the onions? Was it the sugar the recipe called for? Can I leave the sugar out and let the onions caramelize in their own sugars?

I used yellow onions and 1tsp of sugar as directed (I don't usually follow recipes, they're just guidelines to wellness). I can link the recipe if needed. Thank you all in advance and if any additional info is needed I'll make an edit."

All of these recipes come together in like 20 minutes and are almost impossible to mess up.

#The Ingredients

1. **Whole peeled canned tomatoes.** The best tomatoes are generally what end up whole in the cans plus they don't have any firming agents that can keep them from cooking down nicely. imo no point in springing for San Marzano most of the time. I'd recommend Muir Glenn in the US or Mutti in Europe. Keep a few cans around always—obviously they're not going bad anytime soon.
2. **Tomato paste.** The tubes are handy if you'll be using little bits somewhat frequently. I think ATK recommends Cento for this one in the US. I use Mutti again in Europe.
3. **Garlic.** It's garlic. You know the deal. Keeps for a couple weeks at least somewhere cool and dry.
4. **Yellow onions.** Yellow onions are mildest and best for cooked applications imo, but feel free to use white or red if that's how you get your jollies. Also keeps for a couple weeks.
5. **Shallots.** Even milder than the yellow onions. In a pinch, you could use onions in all the recipes that call for shallots. Or shallots in all the recipes that call for onions if you've got that Rockefeller money *Also* keeps for a couple weeks.
6. **Lemons.** Nothing fancy needed. Just plain old lemons. If you like the zest, maybe spring for organic. They keep a week or two in the fridge.
7. **Heavy cream.** Heavy cream or heavy whipping cream both work—just make sure it's not sweetened. Generally lasts about two weeks.
8. **Parmigiano reggiano.** Get the real stuff in its whole form—no ground up shit. It can be DOP if you want but doesn't have to be. There's plenty of great parm out there that isn't DOP-certified (but none of it it sold by Kraft). I personally prefer a 24-month most of the time, but a more complex 36-month has its charms too. It'll last quite a while wrapped up in the fridge.
9. **Pecorino romano.** Another grating cheese, but quite different from parm in flavor. While parm is more about nutty umami, pecorino brings more saltiness and a hint of tang. I'm probably in the minority here, but if both cheeses were in a burning building and I could only save one, I'd save the pecorino. You *can* substitute them for each other in a pinch but, like I said, they're not all that similar.
10. **Guanciale or pancetta.** Guanciale can be challenging to find outside of Europe, but it's worth the effort to track it down. (I think you can even order it on Amazon). It's fattier, sweeter, and milder in flavor than pancetta, but pancetta is much easier to find so you can sub that if needed. You can freeze either for quite a while. Just cut into thickish slabs (roughly ¼"" or 0.5cm) and separate with wax paper then keep it in the freezer. You can cut it into lardons straight from the freezer (it's way easier that way actually) and use it without thawing.
11. **Vodka.** Alternative uses: getting you drunk. Lasts forever.

I'm also assuming that you have some real basics on hand already. Namely salt, black pepper, chili flakes, olive oil, and butter. You'll need the actual pasta too. I recommend De Cecco across the board.

#The Recipes

1. **Basic tomato sauce/arrabbiata.** (Tomatoes, garlic, parm, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). My basic quick tomato sauce is actually based on [Serious Eat's arrabbiata recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/02/penne-pasta-arrabbiata-sauce-recipe.html). If you don't like spice, you can dial the pepper back as much as you like. This works with just about any shape. Penne's a classic, but casarecce might be my fave. Also great on [homemade gnocchi](https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/03/technique-fresh-ricotta-gnocchi-fast.html).
2. **All'amatriciana.** (Tomatoes, onion, pecorino, guanciale/pancetta, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). This is hands down the king of pasta sauces in my book. The pork fat takes everything that's great about tomato sauce and turns it up to 11 with minimal added effort. I use Marcella Hazan's recipe, which you can find [here](https://cookingfrombooks.com/2014/05/12/pasta-allamatriciana-2/). The only alteration I make is I render and crisp the pork first (starting in a cold pan) and *then* add the onions. idk why Marcella never seems to brown meat. Bucatini is supposedly the classic with this, but in Italy I've seen it much more with mezze maniche and I prefer it that way. That's a tough shape to find though, so you can sub something like rigatoni.
3. **Alla gricia.** (Pecorino, guanciale, black pepper, olive oil). Alla gricia is basically the midway point between all'amatriciana and cacio e pepe. Once again, I think the pork really improves on cacio e pepe. While it's fine to sub pancetta in the last recipe, I think this one suffers a bit more from the substitution. I recommend the [Serious Eats recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2018/11/pasta-alla-gricia.html). As with all'amatriciana, mezze maniche or rigatoni is the move.
4. **Cacio e pepe.** (Pecorino, black pepper, olive oil, butter). Is it as good as alla gricia? Despite being much more well-known, I'd say no. But sometimes you can't find guanciale or just can't be assed to render it. Cacio e pepe to the rescue. Once again, [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/02/spaghetti-cacio-e-pepe-recipe.html). Keep in mind that legit pecorino is very salty, so don't oversalt the pasta water. If all pecorino is too much for you, experiment with using part parm. Spaghetti is the way to go for this one.
5. **Alla vodka.** (Tomato paste, shallot, heavy cream, parmesan, vodka, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). Somehow this sauce hits all the exact same comforting notes as boxed mac and cheese (I mean that in the best way possible). I really like the [Bon Appetit](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/fusilli-alla-vodka-basil-parmesan) recipe. Fusilli is awesome with this, but the classic penne also works.
6. **Al limone.** (Garlic, shallot, lemon, heavy cream, parm, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). A break from the tomato-y cheesy porkiness. This is one of my favorites. I use the [Cooks Illustrated recipe](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/videos/1731-spaghetti-with-lemon-and-olive-oil-al-limone) (non-video is paywalled) but add some garlic, chili flake, and a bunch more lemon juice. I skip the zest and herbage. Use spaghetti for this one.

Finally, a couple honorable mentions: you also have all the ingredients here for **aglio e olio** and **alfredo**. I don't personally like either all that much, but I know lots of people go gaga over aglio e olio especially. Try 'em out if they sound up your alley. If you keep eggs around, you could also do **carbonara.** Again, not my fave, but you do you."

* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 clove or garlic (minced)
* 6 scallions (whites cut up)
* 1 tsp sesame oil
* 2 TBSP soy sauce
* 1 tsp Chinese cooking wine
* 1 package of round dumpling wrappers (about 35-45 per package)

Dipping Sauce

* 1/2 cup soy sauce
* 1/4 cup Chinese Chinkiang black vinegar
* 1 tsp ginger (cut 2 thin slices into very thin strips)

&amp;#x200B;

Chop up the cabbage and put in a big bowl and mix in the salt.  Let it sit and wilt a bit.  My mom said that this makes it softer for mixing. Let it sit while you prep the other ingredients.

Combine the ingredients for the dipping sauce.  The ginger will infuse the sauce nicely. :)

Mix pork, cabbage, garlic, scallions, sesame oil, 2 TBSP soy sauce, cooking wine in a bowl until well combined.  Make a small meat pancake and fry it in a skillet.  Taste test and adjust seasonings.

Now it's time to wrap. Use about a rounded teaspoon of filling per wrapper. (YouTube has some really good videos).

To cook the dumplings:. Add about a 1/2 TBSP canola oil to a non-stick pan. Add the dumplings, one by one into the pan...make sure to rub some of the oil in the pan onto the bottom of each dumpling.  Add about 3 TBSP of water.  Cook, covered, on med to low heat for about 7 - 9minutes.  (I usually like to use lower heat in my cooking so that I don't burn my foods.)  Check to see that the dumpling skins look steamed through.  If not steamed through, and the pan is dry, add another TBSP of water.

Once the dumplings look steamed through, take the cover off and turn up the heat a little to crips the bottoms.

Plate the dumplings on a big plate and serve with the ginger dipping sauce.

Enjoy!

Happy Chinese New Year!  May the new year bring you health, prosperity and happiness."

Cooking,"I’m making dinner for my dad tonight (chicken francese) and I’m serving roasted eggplant (sliced in rounds) as a side. I’m pretty positive my dad has never had it so I want to make it great. The problem I have with eggplant is that it sometimes stays floppy/soggy when roasted in the oven. When using those gigantic purple eggplants, I salt and sweat them for 30 min before roasting. Tonight I’m using a graffiti eggplant I got from Kroger. I’ve heard this type doesn’t need to be salted/drained before cooking. Is this true? How can I make sure the surface of the eggplant gets pleasantly crisp? Usually I brush (try to do so lightly) with olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and then roast on a cookie sheet or other shallow pan for 30-40 min, flipping roughly halfway through. Is there anything I can do to help my eggplant crisp up?

Thank you!!!"

Cooking,"Hi Reddit! This is my first post on this sub but I need help from you guys who actually know how to cook well.
I'm from the UK and my partner from South Korea is coming over for the first time in 2 months for a few weeks. If you guys didnt know it's VERY expensive in South Korea to buy fresh ingredients such as meat, vegetables and dairy and there's little chance to try non-Koreanified Western food. My partner is very excited to come over to the UK so that we can cook fresh meals together to save some money for other travels (The UK is quite cheap for groceries). He knows I'm still learning how to cook and I have a few basic dishes I can whip up and some of my other cooking I'd eat myself but I don't feel confident cooking for other people.
I want to surprise him and learn some new recipes before he comes! Preferably Western cuisine he can't get over there (although pretty much anything non East Asian would be fine). I also just need to learn to cook in general.
I'd really appreciate some advice on cooking for a noob like me and some recommendations for easy and impressive recipes and some kitchen basics eg what essential spices would you recommend me to have? (Where I live we have standard British supermarkets, Eastern European markets, Chinese markets and a Middle Eastern supermarket). If you were having Western food for the first time what would you want to try? I've been scouring the All Recipes app all morning but I can't tell the difficulty and I don't trust Pinterest after bad past experience :/

Cooking,"I realize it isn't peak Reddit time, so I'm probably going to have to figure this out on my own. But I've slightly charred the soup part of a big batch of chicken and dumplings (fried my alliums to the bottom while cooking the dumplings-d'oh!) Thankfully I was cooking the dumplings in the broth first to store separately, so the veggies and chicken are unaffected. 


My question is this: is there any way to save the broth? It only tastes slightly charred, it's not strong at all but it is noticeable. I'm ideally looking for something I can add that will hide the burned flavor while still tasting like a proper thick chicken soup."
Cooking,"If anyone is having second thoughts about weird looking fungus, let me settle your doubts. Having come from a poorer upbringing with unhealthy parents, I've been closed off to the world of vegetables that are not frozen peas/carrots/potatoes. Since moving out a few years ago, I've been eating significantly better and exploring what's out there slowly. Let me tell you what, I bought Shiittake mushrooms the other day and had an eye opening experience I will never forget.

I cooked them in olive oil, garlic and balsamic vinegar and thought I was in heaven. I meant to post a picture but I ate them too fast. If anyone has other recommendations as far as recipes with them, I would love to know. They're going to be on my grocery list forever."
Cooking,"I'm looking for inspiration! All my family and friends know I enjoy cooking (and especially baking), so for Christmas and birthdays I often get gift cards to my local kitchenware shop. Grateful as I am, the problem is I'm now at the point where my kitchen is pretty well stocked, so I'm running out of ideas and the gifts cards are accumulating faster than I can spend them.

It's a good opportunity to replace my cheap electric hand mixer with a fancy one (KitchenAid maybe), and I'd still have a fair amount left over for some fun stuff. Or I could spend it all on something cool and expensive, but I've already got the obvious big-ticket items, like a stand mixer, casserole dish, etc.

So let's get super indulgent: how would you spend big money at the kitchen shop? Would you get into making your own cheese or ice cream? Upgrade all the old utensils? Get yet another gorgeous bundt pan or serving platter? Le Creuset oven mitts? A few grams of saffron or powdered vanilla? Bring me your ideas!"
Cooking,"I was looking for a dish that would be extremely cost effective without being tasteless and decided black beans and brown rice with some seasoning would fit the bill. I referenced a recipe online for seasoning ideas, calling for 1 tsp of cumin, 1 tsp of chili powder, and 1/4 tsp of both salt and pepper to be added to 2 cups of beans just a little before they were done cooking. After the beans were done cooking, I put 2 cups of brown rice in with the beans, seasoned it the same as I had for the beans (the reference recipe I had used was only for seasoning the beans so I thought I'd add more to help the rice as well) and cooked the rice. When I went to taste it, everything was cooked perfectly fine, the beans and rice both tender, but it was incredibly bland. 

I ended up doubling the total amount of the seasonings little by little trying to get any semblance of taste out of the mix before I made a hail-Mary at fixing it and added about 1 tsp of garlic powder and 2 tsp of seasoning salt. I normally avoid using this particular seasoning salt because it seems to very easily overpower anything else it is with, but it did give the mix a fair bit of flavor and make it at least edible.

So the advice I wanted to seek out here would be

1. Is there any particular reason the cumin and chili powder would make no profile of their own in this? Far too little seasoning used? Or maybe those two seasonings just won't add any real flavor without more than rice and beans in the dish?
2. What seasonings would any of you use to get the most of simple black beans and brown rice?

And if needed for clarification, I used dried black beans I had soaked for 8 hours and rinsed before cooking and I made sure to thoroughly rinse the rice beforehand to remove starch. The beans had enough leftover liquids in after they had finished cooking to get away with adding about 1/2 cup water to make sure the rice had enough water."

Cooking,"I just wanted to share a couple of cooking anecdotes that really made me feel good over the weekend.

Last week, my youngest daughter (who is 13) kept talking about how she wanted to make a ""healthy meal"" for the family. So, on Friday she decided on making a stir fry using [this handy info-graphic that I show to everyone who is interested in making stir-fry.](http://imgur.com/gallery/HfWH4tt) She took chicken breast, asparagus, broccoli and baby corn and stir-fried it perfectly with the orange ginger sauce recipe. Everyone (meaning my wife, her older sister and my) thought it was really good and she was very proud of herself. I only gave a couple of cooking tips during the process, but she did all the physical work.  It was a pretty great feeling.

Fast forward to Sunday evening. We'd had a big after-church meal and my wife was at her monthly book club, so we weren't going to have any sort of family dinner. At one point in the evening, I saw the leftover broccoli and asparagus in the fridge and resolved to do something with it before it went bad. So, I just put it all on a baking sheet together, hit it with some olive oil, salt and pepper and roasted it. Now, whenever I normally cook broccoli, I always just steam it. The kiddos like that and I've never roasted it before. They've had roasted asparagus before and were luke warm on it. 

When it was done, I told them about it, left it on the counter and then went into another room. I didn't really expect them to like it, but when I came back into the kitchen a little while later - the baking sheet was empty. They'd devoured it all and were asking me to make roasted broccoli again soon. It was a pretty great feeling, knowing how much they liked that - and that it was fairly healthy.

tldr; Cooking with and for family can be pretty rewarding."

Cooking,"I’ve read a couple of posts about guilty pleasures and childhood dishes. In the same general idea, what are some foods you hate, bonus points if you feel like that makes you feel kind of guilty, like you should love it.

I have a couple. I can eat most things, although I tend to stick to the stuff I love, but I have a few foods that I cannot accept that I hate.

1) Curry. On paper, I should like curry. In real life, the smell of it makes me nauseated.

2) Kale. I want to like it. I love Swiss chard, spinach, arugula, etc, but kale feels like chewing on construction paper, no matter how many times I try to like it.

3) Tuna. Now, this one is probably the one that I feel weirdest about because I love fish, and I will eat a tuna salad sandwich 7 days a week. I cannot stand rare tuna, and it used to drive my dad crazy to the point he wouldn’t cook it for me because I wanted it overcooked.

I use either corn meal or semolina on the surface before putting the pizza down on it, and to be fair, the pizza doesn't stick and there are no off flavors, but frankly I find the sticky surface to be kind of disgusting.  It's discolored and tacky.  I haven't put any oil directly on it, but the pizza dough has a bit of oil in it, and I guess that's what's leeching into the stone.

 Q2: i was gonna make a grilled cheese with pesto on it, but i had trouble deciding on cheese(s). I ended up deciding on mozzarella and camembert to give it a milky creaminess and a funky earthiness respectively. The pesto would add the tang / sharpness both those cheeses lack. should i change a cheese to something else? something more sharp like cheddar? im still new to... cheese..

Q3: so then i thought, why not put that red wine sauce on the pesto grilled cheese? give it that sweetness and tartness that it lacks... and also some red onions or sautéed yellow onions for extra crispiness. is this going overboard with flavors?

Cooking,"So I wanted to show you how to make a classic noodle dish from Yibin in the Sichuan province – burning noodles.

Now, upon seeing the words “Sichuan” and “Burning Noodles” in the same sentence, I can probably guess where your mind’s headed. Yep, these noodles are indeed pretty spicy. But no... that’s not actually why they’re called “Burning Noodles”.

The ‘burn’ in burning noodles is a translation for the character ‘ran’ (燃) – which means to light, or to ignite (e.g. the flash point of an oil is referred to as its ‘ran dian’… literally translated, ‘ignition point’). Why ‘ignition noodles’? Well, they’re got the name because… they’re not a soup noodle dish. So much not a soup noodle dish, in fact, you could theoretically take a lighter to them and the noodles would burn in front of you (note: don’t do this, waste of noodles).

Now I know that feels like a hell of a commitment to the concept of ‘not soup noodle’. But you can find this sort of explicitly not-soup noodle dish in old trading towns up and down the middle to upper reaches of the Yangtze river:

1.	[Wuhan, Hot Dry Noodles](https://i.imgur.com/c1tKXua.png).  Wuhan is the last major city right before the three gorges area of the Yangtze river (criminally under-rated food city). One of their most iconic dishes is “hot dry noodles”… the dry referring to the fact that – again – this is not a soup noodle.

2.	[Wanzhou, Zajiang Noodles.](https://i.imgur.com/D9sQGpg.png) Up the river a bit, after the three gorges area – a proper city in its own right, though technically a ‘district’ of Chongqing today. Named so because it was historically place where “a myriad rivers converge and a myriad traders gather” (万川毕汇、万商云集) – though a good chunk of Wanzhou today lies beneath 150 meters of water in the reservoir created by the three gorges dam. One of their famous noodle dishes is called ‘Zajiang Noodle’ (not to be confused with the Northern ‘Zhajiang Noodle’), which’s some dry noodles topped with meat sauce.

3.	[Chongqing, Mala Xiaomian.](https://i.imgur.com/LfYRJYl.png) Historically the focal point of trade in the Sichuan province. Their noodle dish of choice is the fiery xiaomian (‘small noodles’). While historically these noodles were always served dry, today you can find them either dry or in soup.

4.	[Yibin, Burning Noodles.](https://i.imgur.com/7wrLyXO.png) Yibin lies at the Yangtze’s highest navigable point – at the intersection of the Yangtze and the Min river (the latter going up to Leshan – home of the Leshan Giant Buddha – and Chengdu). 

So. Why do all of these places have dry noodles? Even though these cities span three different provinces, they were all *so* influenced by the Yangtze river trade that there’s this… similarity to the cultures there that’s hard to put into words. They’ve all got this… ineffable toughness to them, and these river towns were some of the first in the country to use chili pepper extensively. Some people say that dry noodles were originally popular on the docks because, well, rocky boats aren’t exactly the best place to scarf down a soup noodle. Or perhaps it’s a climate thing. Or maybe, I dunno, they just liked their noodles sans soup for the same reason people in the West generally eat noodles dry – they just… liked them better sometimes. I dunno.

Now of course, this is one of those classic street food sort of dishes, which means its paradoxically (A) simple to serve but (B) time consuming to prep. The way I’d personally sort this logistically would be to sort all of your ingredients in advance (on the weekend or something) and toss them in the fridge. Then the remaining cook time is like… five minutes of work max, so it makes for a great quick snack or an easy dinner, that kind of thing.

So I’ll be splitting this up into three sections. First, ‘stuff to prep in advance’. Second, ‘how to make noodles’ (just in case you’re feeling a Sichuan noodle making project… any sort of alkaline noodle should work ok though). Then lastly, ‘how to make a bowl of burning noodles’. Apologies if this gets confusing – I just was wracking my brain trying to figure out the best way to organize this all so that we could all stay true to the essence of this dish (a quick meal) while still staying true to the flavor.

[Video is here if you’d like a visual to follow along](https://youtu.be/A1y-OhS9z20). I go off on the history a touch again in the beginning there, so jump in at ~ the two minute mark if you want just the recipe.

## Things to prepare in advance for Burning Noodles

Ok, so there’s either three or four things that I think would be convenient to prepare in advance:

* An Yibin-style chili oil called ‘xiangyou’.

* Toasted crushed peanuts.

* Toasted crushed sesame seeds.

* Toasted yacai – pickled and fermented mustard greens.

For those then, you’ll need:

1.	*Dried Sichuan Erjingtiao chilis (二荆条) -or- Arbols, 20g; Dried Heaven Facing Chili (朝天椒) -or- Thai Birds Eye, 10g; or sub in ~1/3 cup of a good chili powder.* So traditionally the chili oil is made with a toasted chili powder – a powder made from a mix of two parts Sichuan erjingtiao chili (a chili that’s roughly as how as cayenne and is known for its vibrant red color) and one part Heaven facing chili (a… quite spicy chili that’s related to and slightly more mild than Thai bird’s eye). Arbols or cayennes are an acceptable sub for Erjingtiao (though you could perhaps add a pinch of Korean chili powder for color if its convenient), Thai bird’s eye is a very close sub for Heaven facing (though Thai bird’s eye *is* hotter, fair warning).

2.	*Sichuan caiziyou (菜籽油) -or- Indian mustard seed oil -or- Peanut oil (花生油), 60g.* So right – like all oil-heavy dishes in the Chinese southwest, Yibin xiangyou relies on a virgin rapeseed oil called Caiziyou. It’s… really really hard to come by in the West (though there’s been some sightings in NYC, and it looks like Mala Market – an online Sichuan ingredient shop – might be getting some in soon). I bring it up not to tease you, but because it’s a foundational flavor. After testing a number of different oils, I found Indian mustard seed oil to be almost indistinguishable after heating it up… close enough to be a direct sub. That said, I know Indian mustard seed oil *also* isn’t exactly a supermarket staple in the West… so barring that, just use peanut oil. Not perfect, but should still taste good.

3.	*Lard (猪油) -or- cooked peanut oil (花生油), 60g.* So after making the chili oil, we’ll be mixing in a good chunk of melted lard. That said, this *is* one of those almost-veg dishes, so if you’re cooking for vegetarians… feel free to swap in cooked peanut oil instead. Basically just heat the peanut oil up til smoke point like we do in the recipe below, **cool it down a bit** and reserve (note: add the peanut oil at, let's say... 80C give or take). Not as authentic as lard, but should still be real nice in the dish. 

4.	*Spices/seasonings for the chili oil: 25g smashed ginger (姜), one whole walnut (带壳核桃), ½ cinnamon stick (桂皮), 2 star anise (八角), 1 tsp Sichuan peppercorn (花椒).* Yep, that one whole walnut – shell and all. Lends a nice earthiness to the chili oil… a real classic in Yibin xiangyou.

5.	 *Peanuts (生花生), 5 tbsp.* We’ll be toasting these, then crushing them. If you’d like, feel free to swap for an equal amount of roasted peanuts in order to skip the toasting process.

6.	*Sesame seeds (白芝麻), 1.5 tbsp.*  We’ll also be toasting and crushing these as well.

7.	*Yacai (芽菜), ~1/2 cup.* So right. The bane of many people in the West attempting to recreate Sichuan dishes – yacai (pickled and fermented mustard greens) is a non-negotiable must here. While not all Asian supermarkets carry it, the good ones do – and [it’s always available extremely overpriced online](https://www.amazon.com/Bin-Sui-Cai-SuiMiYaCai-Vegetable/dp/B01N7T7M4X).

Note that all of these amounts’ll be enough for 4-5 bowls of noodles. Feel free to scale these up if you’d like.

*Process: Chili oil, nuts, and yacai prep:*

Let’s just start with the chili oil because it’s the most intensive. For the chili oil:

1.	*If working from dried chilis, toast for ~5 minutes over medium-low flame.* The chilis’ll be done once they’ve deepened in color and started to smell real nice. As always with toasting chilis though, it’s safer to under toast than over toast.

2.	*Snip the chilis into 2cm sections, keeping the seeds but tossing the stems.*

3.	*Pulse for ~6 minutes in a blender until the chilis are rather fine flakes. Reserve.* You’re looking for a pretty ‘powdery’ chili flake – [something like this](https://i.imgur.com/uepeCo8.png).

4.	*Heat up your 60g of caiziyou (or mustard seed oil, or peanut oil) until it begins to smoke, ~230C. Keep it at that temperature for about 1-2 minutes, then shut off the heat.* Yeah, that’s not a typo – 230C. Heating the oil like this is a must for both Sichuan caiziyou *and* Indian mustard seed oil – doing so’ll significantly reduce the pungency of the oil. Makes peanut oil taste pretty good, too.

5.	*Let the oil cool down to 200-210C, then add in the ginger, the walnut, the Sichuan peppercorn, the cinnamon, and the star anise. Cook for ~5 minutes.* Adding this stuff’ll lower the temperature – not a problem, we’re looking for this to slowly cook at around 150C. If the temperature dips too far below 150C (likely), swap the heat back on to roughly cook at that temperature. It’s fine if it’s a bit variable, but you **do** need it to be at ~150 before the next step.

6.	*Take out some of the clunkier spices, then strain the oil into the chili flakes.* It’ll sizzle in a real satisfying way. Quick stir.

7.	*Melt the lard, then pour it in with the chili oil.* Another quick stir.

And… there you have it. Reserve that stuff, it’s good to use for the burning noodles.

As for everything else?

1.	*Toasted the peanuts over a medium flame for ~12 minutes.* Toast until the peanuts are cooked through and charred on the outside.

2.	*Rub the peanuts with your fingers, then lightly blow off the peels.* Or peel however you feels like, but blowing the peels off is a lot easier than going one by one.

3.	*Put the toasted peanuts in a bag, and light roll over them with a rolling pin or a 24oz beer bottle for ~2 minutes.* A beer bottle is super classic for this lol. Regardless, you want something [about this consistency](https://i.imgur.com/4UVdtSW.png). (Sorry for the blurry pic there)

4.	*Toast the sesame seeds over a medium-low flame for about five minutes.* Or until the sesame seeds start to darken and/or you can hear a couple popping.

5.	*In a mortar -or- with a bag/beer bottle, ever so lightly crush the sesame to get them to release their oil.* Some that [looks about like this](https://i.imgur.com/DghOB5W.png). 

6.	*Soak the yacai in cool water for ~5 minutes.* Doing this will get out their salinity.

7.	*Toast the yacai over a medium-low flame for 1-2 minutes.* Or until dry and just barely beginning to stick to the wok.

Note that we actually didn’t toast our yacai because we… prefer it untoasted. It’s a little sharper and funkier that way. The more proper way is to toast though, so… do that.

## How to Make Sichuan-style Alkaline Noodles

Ok, so again. This is not a must or anything. Want to sub in Japanese ramen noodles? Sure, go for it. But really… any noodle that has a nice bite to it should work fine. Want to use dried spaghetti? I mean… it wouldn’t be the same for sure, but it could still be tasty. Just be sure to cook al dente, and never tell a soul I said it was ok. 

But I do think it’s nice to undertake a noodle project every now and then – if only to help understand what you’re going for, and to guide more informed shopping choices in the future.

It’s also pretty easy in the grand scheme of things. And we’ll be using a pasta maker and a stand mixer to make our life even easier.

*Ingredients, Sichuan-style alkaline noodles:*

1.	*Bread flour -or- Chinese noodle flour (高筋面粉), 300g.* Basically anything with a higher gluten content – we were working with something that was 12.8% protein IIRC.

2.	*Water, 125g.* Or I guess 126 to be exact – we were going with 42% hydration. Note that this’ll make for a really dry dough… and some recipes go even drier than that (we actually saw one that was 38% hydration). 

3.	*Sodium carbonate (碱面), ½ tsp.* So yeah – that’s sodium carbonate, *not* sodium bicarbonate (i.e. baking soda). It’s a much stronger base… sporting a pH of ~11.5 to baking soda’s ~8.5. It’s readily available online, and feel free to sub in Jianshui/Kan Sui/Lye water if that’s more convenient. All of the above inconvenient? Feel free to use the baked baking soda trick – I’ll detail how in the notes below.

*Process, Sichuan style alkaline noodles:*

1.	*Dissolve the sodium carbonate in with the water.* Mix well.

2.	*Slowly add the water/sodium carbonate mixture into the flour, mixing it in bit by bit.* Especially because this’s a pretty dry dough, so doing it bit by bit helps the flour absorb the water more evenly. Aim for the dry parts when tossing in the water. I like mixing in with a single chopstick – less sticky that way.

3.	*Knead for ~8 minutes -or- use a stand mixer with the hook attachment on speed two.* Same ~8 minutes. Especially with the hook attachment, you might find the dough to still be a bit crumbly after eight minutes – no problem at all, just press and knead it together by hand until it all comes together. It’ll still be a bit craggly – no worries. 

4.	*Cover, let it rest for ~30 minutes.*

5.	*Cut the dough in half, then roll it into something that looks vaguely ‘sheet-ish’.* We’ll be working this one half at a time. Rolling it’s just to get it to squeeze into the pasta maker easier.

6.	*Flour the dough and pasta maker, then pass it through at the largest setting. Then do the same at the third smallest setting.*

7.	*Fold the dough ~four times, then slice it with a knife to make noodles.* So two choices here – machine cut or knife cut noodles. If you want your pasta maker to cut them, just uh… cut them. We’re looking for noodles that’re about 2mm wide. You can also cut them by hand too, of course – there’s something about the texture of knife cut noodles that I seem to prefer, but it’s hard to pinpoint what exactly. Either way, you want something that looks [more or less like this](https://i.imgur.com/ktSUbSr.png).

8.	*Pull apart and thoroughly flour the noodles.* Add more flour than you think you might need when flouring them – nothing’s worse than making a bunch of noodles, only to have them end up as one sticky mass.


In an ideal world, eat… soon. But I’ve found these are still quite good even 48-72 hours later too.

## Putting together our Burning Noodles

So in Yibin, in most of the noodle shops you have one of two choices: 100g of noodles (二两) or 150g of noodles (三两). We’ll be assuming a 150g bowl of noodles, mostly just because it feels a bit more substantive to me personally.

*Ingredients, one bowl of burning noodles:*

1.	*Fresh noodles, 150g.*

2.	*Yibin chili oil, 2 tbsp.* I.e. the chili oil from above.

3.	*Light soy sauce (生抽), 1 tsp.*

4.	*Toasted sesame oil, 1 tsp.* Actually most authentic here would be untoasted sesame oil (referred to as ‘white’ sesame oil – 白芝麻油). We used toasted out of laziness in sourcing mostly, but both work great.

5.	*Toasted -or- untoasted yacai (芽菜), 2 tbsp.* So yeah, we actually preferred ours untoasted here. But toasted yacai is more proper, so let that be your default choice.

6.	*Mixed toasted crushed peanuts/sesame, 2 tbsp.*

7.	*Sliced scallion greens (葱), ~2 tbsp.*

8.	*MSG (味精), ¼ tsp -or- chicken bouillon powder (鸡粉), ½ tsp.* Either way – chicken bouillon powder’s basically MSG (well actually usually a mix of disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate given how hyperbolic some Westerns are of MSG) plus some other stuff anyhow. You find see both in Yibin.  

*Process, Burning Noodles:*

Ok, quick aside on equipment. One super classic thing that you’ll see in Yibin are [these things](https://i.imgur.com/tfaiuKs.png) – basically, vendors’ll toss the noodles in after cooking and vigorously strain them in a snapping circular motion. You certainly don’t need to be that obsessive – just do a bang up job straining them. That said, if something conical like a chinois is handy, why not? Just toss the noodles in and snap strain like the vendors do. Plus, you feel all cool doing it.

You don’t want too much time in between straining and doing the initial mix with the liquid ingredients (like, ~60 seconds max), so be sure to have everything handy.

1.	*Cook the noodles until -just- past al dente, ~1 minute.* I usually just time this kind of thing by trying it and seeing what the texture’s like… it ended up being ~1 minute for the fresh alkaline noodles we made above. But don’t take my word for it – if you’re working with a package, go with the package… and even if you’re using the same fresh noodle recipe above, it’s possible that you couldn’t cut your noodles a little thinner or a little thicker. So yeah. Taste the noodles.

2.	*Thoroughly strain the noodes.* It’s really tough to describe this motion… basically you barely lift the strainer up above your shoulder, then snap it down to your waist. Do this 4-5 times and the noodles should be pretty dry. Or alternatively, strain however the hell you feel like – just make sure to move fast so they’re not clumping/sticking on you. 

3.	*Add the liquid ingredients: the chili oil, the soy sauce, the sesame oil.* Give it a thorough mix.

4.	*Top with the rest of the ingredients, then serve.* Mix it all up right before eating.

**Note on how to make sodium carbonate:**

So, why do we even use baking soda in baked goods and such? Well, for two reasons. First is that you can combine it with an acid like cream of tartar and make things puff up in the same way your elementary science fair volcano puffed up. 

Reason two? To make it decompose.

See, at temperatures above 80C, baking soda decomposes and forms (1) water vapor (well, water vapor over 100C of course…) (2) carbon dioxide and (3) sodium carbonate. That CO2 is what the gluten network in your pancakes traps, and what makes them light and airy. But you can take advantage of the same reaction to get your hands on some sodium carbonate, even if it’s not sold at your local supermarket.

Hat tip to Alex the French Guy cooking for this bit, his channel’s where I first heard of this. Just spread some baking soda out on a tray and bake it in a pre-heated oven at 150C for one hour. After that, jar it up and… there’s some sodium carbonate for you. Use it for this recipe, and basically anytime a recipe writer is telling you to use baking soda in order to raise pH (e.g. in Chinese velveting/marinades, the onion browning trick, de-sliming shrimp, etc etc). Sodium carbonate’ll be much stronger, so you’ll need a much smaller quantity, and it won’t alter the final taste of the dish like baking soda sometimes has the tendency to do."
Cooking,"After Pepperplate, in the last few days, decided to charge $3/month with no visible improvements I came here looking for a replacement.

Going through older posts I came across  u/julianpoy 's own recipe wonder called  [https://recipesage.com](https://recipesage.com/) and I gotta tell you, so far it is a great site/app.

Works well on desktop (Windows).  

Just downloaded the app (is it an app?) on Android and it works well also.

The transfer of my recipes from Pepperplate worked fine.  It took a few minutes (127 recipes).   

The *Scale Recipe* feature is great.  Same with the *select multiple recipes at once* feature (Put it to the test as for some reason it imported my recipes twice, possibly something I did, but it was easy to delete the doubles with this feature).

Made a change to a recipe in the phone app and the desktop version showed the updated recipe when I logged in.  

There is no fuss or ads.  It is simple and really, what else do you need?

I am excited to see how well this works for me on the next few weeks/months of using it, but my first impression is a 5/5.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you, u/julianpoy."
Cooking,"[Here's the finished product!](https://imgur.com/KW8nMPF) I made the pasta from scratch with my new pasta roller. It was a lot of fun!

[This is the recipe I used.](https://www.prouditaliancook.com/2019/11/four-cheese-ravioli-with-herb-embedded-pasta.html?m) I pretty much followed the recipe for everything, except I added the zest of one meyer lemon, which helped cut through the richness of all the cheese. 

This recipe didn't include a topping, but I went with a classic and simple [brown butter.](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/how-to-brown-butter/) 

For the topping, I toasted up some pine nuts and gave them a rough chop. I had plenty of parsley and sage left over from the dough, so I minced those very finely. I sprinkled both on top, then added some more lemon zest and parmesan.  

This came out so, so good! For me, it was worth the effort. Once I made the dough, everything else was pretty quick to come together. 

If you have a pasta roller and some patience, I recommend giving this recipe a go!

Cooking,"I love oysters.  I order them often at restaurants but rarely eat them at home.  When I do eat them at home, I clean them under cold water, then I soak them. 

 I usually soak them in a gallon of filtered water and 1/3 a cup salt and some ice.  I let them sit it in it for about 20 minutes, pour out the water, wash them off and soak them again in the same water/salt solution.  I’ve been told this gets them tasting fresher and also helps remove any sand that may be in these guys.

This sauce really...REALLY does not work with this recipe. Maybe it’s just me. But it’s tangy and citrusy and it just does not taste good with meat and leeks. I already poured it all over the pot of gnocchi. (I tasted it by itself before adding it and thought it was good!) Any suggestions on what I could add to make it less...tangy, I guess?

It's not crucial of course but if anyone has any tips or personal experiences that they have paired to perfection I would love to know.

1. Red wine
2. Shallots
3. Balsamic

Cooking,"Oyster artichoke soup was a special part of my childhood in New Orleans. Every Christmas, the whole family would get together at my grandparents’ house. My grandfather spent all day making the soup from scratch. It was fantastic.  

After my grandfather died, I asked my mother and her siblings for the recipe. None of them had it, but my mother had her own version that tasted exactly like my grandfather’s. However, my mom made the soup from canned and frozen ingredients.  

I have tried many, many different recipes for oyster artichoke soup, but none of them come close to this one. I would really rather make it from scratch, like my grandfather did, but I don’t have the recipe.  

My mom’s recipe follows. If any of you good folks have suggestions as to how I could deconstruct and recreate my grandfather’s recipe from this one, I’d really appreciate the help!  

&gt; 
&gt; **Oyster Artichoke Soup**  
&gt; *Ingredients:*
&gt; 
&gt; * 2 pints oysters with juice
&gt; * 5 cans artichoke quarters (remove tough parts)
&gt; * 2 bags frozen chopped onions, celery and peppers
&gt; * 4 tbsp flour
&gt; * 4 tbsp butter
&gt; * 2 cans condensed mushroom soup
&gt; * 2 cans condensed celery soup
&gt; * 2 cans condensed cheddar cheese soup
&gt; * 2 cans mushrooms, stems and pieces
&gt; 
&gt; *Directions*  
&gt; Heat the butter in a large, heavy-bottom pot. Add the flour and stir to make a blond roux. Add vegetables and cook until wilted. Add artichokes and mushrooms. Cook for about 15 minutes. Add all soups and heat through. Do not allow to come to a boil. If the mixture is too thick, add cream or half and half, a little at a time. Do not add milk, as it will curdle. Add oysters and their liquor. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve.  

FWIW, the beginning steps - making a roux and cooking the trinity (onions, celery, peppers) - are classic starting steps for many Creole dishes. I think the issue comes in with the canned soups. I have tried making my own mushroom, celery and cheese soups as starters for this one, but the final result comes out one of two ways 1) tastes OK, but is too watery or 2) too strongly flavored of either mushroom or celery but consistency is right."

Cooking,"I'm sitting here eating a really really good bowl of ramen.  It's so good.  And it reminds me of a conversation I had with a friend of mine some time ago where we both agreed that learning how to cook has been one of the greatest benefits in our respective lives.  Being able to put ingredients together and turn out something that you like, and maybe even other people like, is simply *joy.*  Not being limited to what restaurants you can find is *freedom* and I am so so grateful for having learned this skill.

If I could thank people, I'd have to thank just a whole host of chefs who have had cooking shows that I have devoured relentlessly for decades.  The first cooking show I ever remember watching as a kid was [The Frugal Gourmet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfigPIvycCc) (Jeff Smith) on PBS.  After that Food Network took off and I definitely ate up Emeril, Alton Brown, Mario Batali and others.  On the internet I continue to follow Chef John at Food Wishes,  Adam Ragusea, Alex at French Guy Cooking and all the wonderful folks over at the Bon Apetit Test Kitchen.  Without all of these inspirations in my life, I'd still be eating macaroni and cheese out of a box probably.

Anyway, if you're unsure, just starting out, have no idea what you're doing or are afraid of 'screwing up' in the kitchen, I have to say: just do it.  Just keep cooking, screw things up, learn from your mistakes.  It's so rewarding in the end, I promise.

As for my ramen, this is what I do to make it fantastic:

1) Throw away that stupid packet of 'flavor' they put in there.  It's worthless.  Get yourself some Better Than Bullion in whatever flavor you like (there are several).  It's infinitely superior.

2)  Sear off some chicken breasts and finish them in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes or so.

3) stir fry some veggies and just put them in a bowl to wait for now.  I use carrots, broccoli and onions.

4) On top of those veggies in that bowl, put the following: soy sauce (amount to taste), sriracha (ditto), fresh garlic, and freshly grated ginger.  All of this can sit for a few minutes marinating it's fine.

5) Use the pasta water to dissolve the bullion and just dump all of that over your noodles and veggies.  The broth will form instantly and take on a deep, rich color and you'll be able to smell that ginger throughout the house.  It's wonderful.

6) Top with chicken breasts, cut on the bias.  Finish with some cilantro or scallion or even a couple soft boiled eggs if you want.

Obviously this isn't a complicated recipe or particularly inventive, but it's just great and something I would never have dreamed of doing before I really got into cooking.

I went hunting with a buddy this weekend and shot a snow goose, and decided to just throw a brunch skillet together. It came out WAY better than I expected and I wanted to share with y'all. Detailed recipe below, but first, Imgur link to the finished tastiness:

https://imgur.com/gallery/QP1bq0k

Okay so recipe-ish. I don't cook with specific measurements all the time, I just kind of feel it out most of the time.

1) The night before your brunch, clean your goose breast fillets (I just used one for this one shared meal). Combine goose breasts in a plastic bag with 1/3 measure each of: Sriracha, Worcestershire sauce, and Sweet Chili Sauce (I used Frank's Kickin' Garlic Sauce in a substitution), where the marinade mixture just covers the goose in the bag. Cool and let it marinate over night (you don't have to do it overnight, just give it an hour or more if you're in a hurry).

2) Half-ish of a bag of frozen breakfast hasbrowns (the shredded kind). I cooked those in the vegetable oil the bag suggested, and added some pepper and garlic seasoning after they'd cooked a bit and I was stirring for the first time. Finish them and set them to the side.

3) Heat a cast iron skillet with a small amount (maybe 2TBSP tops) of Grapeseed Oil on high, until just before your oil smokes. Sear your goose breast to preference. I like my wild game cooked to rare/medium rare if it's able to be safely consumed that way, so I really just did 2.5 minutes on each side, and left it in the hot skillet while I tidied my workspace a bit. I discarded the used marinade, but if you wanted you could heat it up on the stove to a boil and reduce it to make a nice spicy glaze during this time.

4) Remove your goose breast from the skillet, put it on a cutting board to rest. Add the hash brown potatoes to the cast iron and use a spoon or spatula to stir them in the leftover stuck on stuff, oil, and juices from your searing.

5) In a separate pan, put about 2TBSP of butter to melt on medium, then fry two eggs over easy, adding a small amount of pepper and garlic powder, to taste.

6) Slice your goose to preferred thickness, lay it on the potatoes, add your eggs, and drizzle either your glaze you chose to make or sprinkle Cholula on top.

It came out way better than expected, and my buddy actually commented that ""I would never be disappointed if a fancy brunch place brought this meal to me."" 

I love wild game and this recipe actually offered very little of the game-y taste I expected, probably because of the overnight marinade. If you have any tips to offer to make it better or enhance this meal, please let me know! Thanks!

My mom only soaks bacalao for maybe 2 to 4 hours. She just rinses it thoroughly several times. I made some for myself and soaked it maybe 1 hour, but it came out fine since I changed out the water more than on once. There was only a mild saltiness; for the most part it tasted plain."

I used Samin Nosrat's recipe from Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat. In the book, as in the Netflix series, she goes on and on about the soffritto. But I didn't understand how much flavor could actually come from sauteed celery and carrots. Onions sure, but celery and carrots?

Not to mention the wine, the bay leaves, the lemon and orange zest, cinnamon stick, nutmeg and tomato paste.

And this thing simmered for about 3 hours. The result is a meat sauce that was filling, complex, and made the apartment smell amazing. 10/10 will make again.

The only changes I would make is to hold off on the eggs until you've added the salt/pepper, so that you can add enough to taste, and that it's easier to scoop them out with a spoon, roll into a ball, gently pat down flat, and *then* put them in the pan. It's much harder to flatten them once they are in the pan. Make 1 test fritter to taste for seasoning, too. 

 [https://aggieskitchen.com/ricotta-and-spinach-fritters/](https://aggieskitchen.com/ricotta-and-spinach-fritters/) 

 

2 cups ricotta 

3 eggs, lightly whisked

3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

1 cup Panko

2 cups fresh spinach, sliced thin

a couple of good pinches of salt and pepper

6-8 tablespoons olive oil, divided, for frying (use more or less based on your preference)

 

1. Add ricotta, eggs, Parmesan cheese, panko, salt and pepper to a large bowl. Stir gently until just combined. Fold spinach into mixture.
2. Drizzle about a tablespoon or two of olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat and spread around. Scoop a heaping tablespoon of ricotta and spinach mixture into hot oil and gently push down with spoon to spread and flatten just a bit, this helps them all cook up evenly. Repeat with as many spoonfuls as fit in your pan (I made 5 - 6 per batch).
3. Cook for about 2 minutes on first side until golden brown. Flip and continue to cook another 2 minutes until other side browns as well. Serve warm, room temperature or cold out of the refrigerator as a snack."

I've discovered I like cooking with white wine, want to learn to deglaze and need some practice sautéing so I thought I might do some fish with a mushroom and white wine sauce.

So my plan was to sauté mushrooms and fish, then make a pan sauce with white wine but I'm not sure the best approach here, or for future dishes. I can think of three ways of going about it and would like some help with what I should do and when.

Fistly I could sautee the mushroom, and fish in the same pan then deglaze it with the wine for the sauce.

I could do it in seperate pans, then de glaze each and add the two sauces together to make one or keep it seperate and have two sauces

Or I could just deglaze one pan for the sauce and ignore the other.

I leaning towards doing everything in one pan, seems like it'd be the easiest but I'm also thinking what would be best for the future when I need to use two pans and want to make the sauce."

Cooking,"This is something that is used constantly in professional kitchens but I never really see used in home kitchens (at least in the West). It is incredibly easy to make and store, and will absolutely transform your sauteeing/high heat cooking. 


To make it, simply add butter to a sauce pan- the size depends on how much clarified butter you want to make. I wouldn't do anything less than a pound, but I recommend you do a couple pounds - it lasts longer than whole butter because of the lack of milk solids so it won't go bad. Melt the butter down, and using a spoon, ladle off the white solids. You could either pour the butter through a fine mesh sieve with some cheese cloth to separate the butter from the solids at the bottom, or you can just ladle the butter out carefully (I recommend doing this).


To take it a step further and make ghee, simply cook the butter longer until the milk solids start to brown and the butter smells slightly nutty, and then strain.


The biggest advantage to using clarified butter is it's smoke point. It has a smoke point of around 450F (232C), which is around the same as corn and peanut oil, is higher than canola oil (400F, 205C), and much higher than extra virgin olive oil (330F, 166C) and whole butter (350F, 176C) This means you can get your pan hotter, allowing you to get harder sears on your food.


Another advantage, obviously, is flavor. I'm sure I dont need to tell you that butter tastes amazing, and is much preferable to vegetable/canola oil. You can use it exactly how you would use any other cooking oil, but some suggestions:


-Sauteeing veggies


-Eggs - great for getting a crispy over easy egg


-Use it for searing meats


-Poach shrimp in it


-Making hollandaise. If anyone is interested in an awesome hollandaise recipe, just let me know. It's the one I was taught at my culinary school and developed by the CIA. This post is long enough as it is, though, so I don't want to make it any longer.

In parts of the grate, the black color looks to be wearing off and exposing a silver layer of the grate. I think this comes from shifting pots and pans on top of the surface.

Should I be seasoning these grates like I do my cast iron pans?  If so, how should I go about that?  I should note that the grates have some little rubber feet on them so they lay softly on the surface of the range.  So I think putting them in the oven is out of the question.

Cooking,"Here there! I'm kinda trying to learn some basic cooking and a few days ago I first experimented with using egg&amp;milk batter for chicken breast. While taste-wise it turned out okay, there were not crispy. I stay away from fried foods if there is an oven alternative, in which I usually cook/bake with.  


So I kinda eye-balled the egg-to-milk ratio for the batter, are there ratio's or rules? I used a mix of corn-starch and potato starch, also eyeballing the ratio. Are there any real differences in using the two? I also see a lot of people double starching; starching directly to the dried chicken breast, egg coating, again starching. Is this suitable for oven purposes?  
I used a oven sheet and lined it with non-stick baking paper and coated it with advocado oil (was the only thing available at the moment). I don't quite understand the need to drizzle it on top of the chicken as well, would that not prevent from crisping?  


How to get the coating as crispy as possible in the oven?"

I wanted to make dinner for my s/o for valentines day. They live ~60-70 min away and also have a fairly small apartment/kitchen (kitchen just has a stove and microwave). It wouldn't be possible for me to prep and cook an entire meal there so I was thinking of prepping something ahead of time and either heating/finishing cooking it at the apartment. Alternatively, I could find something that cooks fairly quickly from a grocery store nearby and make that in the apt.

Cooking,"Hi all,

My girlfriend and I will be hosting a dinner party for 5-6 of our friends. I'm trying to create a bit of a ""fancy"" dinner without having a huge amount of culinary experience.

So far I have thought of two appetisers. Dessert will be done by girlfriend, but definitely taking recommendations.

First course:

Spanish seafood stew with squid, hake, mussels and shrimp in a tomato/onion/garlic sauce

Second course:

Homemade spicy tuna/cayenne pâtè served with dijon mustard flavoured crostini and heavy cream based sauce

Main couse:

Looking for recommendations. Should follow the fish/seafood theme for the dinner. I'd try and avoid any pasta or similar stuff, since this is a staple of my everyday meals. 

I was thinking maybe fishcakes would be good?"
Cooking,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

This question is kinda of embarassing, but here it goes.

As for the context, I am 19 year old and decided that it'd really be time to pick up cooking, but I'm not really sure on where to start.

I still live at my mom's house as I'm still in school, and there's no real benefit of me moving out since it's fairly close to where my mom lives, and because of this reason I've pretty much relied on my mom's cooking until now. 

For school, I'll have to do an intern for \~4 months straight, which will be in a foreign country. This will start in late august, however, I have never really cooked apart from some eggs and simple pasta. I talked about it with my mom and she said that I could start cooking a bit for myself, and that she'd be there while I cooked to help me out and what not, but I had to come up with a list of dishes I'd like to be able to cook and whatnot.

The intern will be in Hungary, and I currently live in the Netherlands, if this matters for some reason regarding the recommendations.

&amp;#x200B;

The question here would be; Do you guys have any dishes you'd recommend starting with, and possibly even some receipts I could follow which aren't too hard to start out with?"
Cooking,"Like the title says, have a package of raw chicken that's been in the fridge since Monday, 1/13. I've heard 1-2 days but the chicken smelled fine, didn't feel slimy, and the sell by date is tomorrow.

I've seen chicken with much shorter sell-by dates at the store before so I'm sort of assuming some chicken is kept in storage by stores for awhile before being sold? And I'm assuming they don't follow the 1-2 days rule, either. Would y'all use or toss?

Cooking,"Hi, maybe someone knows about this, its hard to explain, there i go:

When i make my own version of kung pao chicken, I cut chicken breasts and make a marinade with soy sauce, mirim (or another acidic solution), and spices, garlic ginger and so on, nothing special, is in almost every Asian recipe and the target is to add flavor to the chicken.

After I cook it, another thing happens, it's like magic, the texture changes, and this new texture is an absolute miracle. I don't know how to describe, its more gummy, smooth, cant sense the fibers in the meat.

And my doubt always is why? why does this happens? is the soy sauce? the chilling? the rehidratation of the meat? the acidic ingredients on the marinade? or the sudden change of temperature when I throw it on the flaming hot wok?

And then, a couple days ago, I saw a video where i learned a technique called **brine** first time i ear about it (its not popular here in Argentina) they drown the chicken in salty water overnight, apparently by osmosis an interchange of fluids happens and the chicken gets more salty and less dry when you cook it on the even, french technique i guess.

I am thinking now that this is what happens with the soy marinade every time! am i right?

Maybe I could even make red meat smoother without changing the flavor!.

What do you think?..."

This includes the broken off layers of the main parts.  Yams, potatoes, squash, cauliflower, asparagus, brussell sprouts, onions, peppers of all sorts, a mix of italian veg.  Doesn't matter what it is.

We made a serious change and we follow a healthy balanced diet. We both lost weight already in the first two weeks which is nice! The problem however is the food we eat for dinner. Now to have a balanced meal we have 200 grams of vegetables, a small portion of carbs(rice, pasta, potatoes etc.) And a portion of protein. However so far the food we make is kinda boring and doesn't taste great. For instance we made salmon last night with potatoes and broccoli. Salmon was nice potato and brocolli were not that much.

But that aside, when I use their ""Find My Field"" tool, it seems the tomatoes legitimately come from farms in the Mt. Vesuvius region of Italy (assuming the tool isn't rigged).

Why doesn't Cento seek true D.O.P. certification for their San Marzano tomatoes? Could it be their way to keeping costs down? Or are they unable to get certification (I noticed the fields are often adjacent to a populated road or highway so maybe air quality plays into it)?

FWIW, I recall reading somewhere that actual D.O.P. tomatoes exported to U.S. supermarkets are all Grade C, and that the ""good"" crops are kept by the Italians and/or are only accessible to purchase by restaurants.

**My own opinion:** I often find Cento tomatoes to be a bit ""brighter"" in taste than actual D.O.P. tomatoes from brands like Sclafani or La Fede. I'd say a non-discerning, non-picky eater wouldn't really be able to tell the difference. Whereas you can absolutely tell the difference between Cento/Sclafani D.O.P./La Fede D.O.P. vs. domestic tomatoes distributed by Muir Glen, Jersey Fresh, Bianco diNapoli, etc."

Cooking,"I’m trying my best to replicate my grandmother’s roast recipe, and I don’t know much about it, but I’ve never been able to really get it.

All I can say for sure is that she seared it before hand (no big surprise there) and she put garlic cloves into the meat.

But when it was done it was super, fall-apart tender, and absolutely infused with garlic flavor in every bite.

The only time I’ve personally tasted anything like it is, very randomly to me, at the Iraqi-Jewish restaurant Azura in Jerusalem’s main market, where they serve a “beef sofrito” that is cubes of beef instead of a whole roast.  And damn if it doesn’t taste just like my grandmother’s.

In any event, does anyone have any idea for how to achieve the garlic-in-every-bite, fall-apart roast?  I don’t even know what cut of beef.  And every time I try, even absolutely bombarding the thing with garlic cloves, I get barely any garlic flavor."

Cooking,"I have a friend who does it all the time and I decided to give it a shot last night. I couldn't tell you the last time I roasted a whole bird, as I've always felt like it didn't turn out well, like I always overcooked it. But spatchcocking is a game changer. This was literally the best roast chicken I've ever done, and the breast meat was so incredibly moist. Holy crap! And it was so easy!

Preheat oven to 425, line a sheet pan with parchment.

Halve small golden potatoes, slice onions and carrots (I didn't have carrots last night but will the next time), toss with a little olive oil  and salt and pepper and add to sheet pan in a single layer.  You could also add garlic and fresh herbs to the veg.

Flip the bird over and, using kitchen shears, cut along both sides of the spine to remove it.  Then, using a sharp knife, score the breast bone.  Place bird breast side up on top of the veg and press down on the breast bone until it breaks to flatten everything out. 

Brush skin with olive oil and season with salt and pepper and put in the middle rack of the oven. Cook for 45 minute and then check doneness with an instant read thermometer in the breast/thigh, sticking it back in for a few minutes if it's not 165. 

This was so easy and so good.

Cooking,"I’ve been through four attempts at making chicken stock at home now, and I might just be ready to quit. The stock always comes out smelling terrible, as opposed to the yummy, chicken-y smell described by most recipes. 

I start by breaking down an entire chicken manually. I roast the bones in a convention oven until they are a deep golden brown color. I drop the bones into my Instant Pot along with onion, carrot, and celery, and bring the stock up to a boil (No seasoning). After 3 hours, my stock comes out a beautiful golden color, but smells like hell (At least to me).

My problem might be that I’m not removing scum. However, when I bring the soup to a boil, I don’t notice any significant amount of scum rising to the top at all, so I just place the lid on my InstantPot and set the device to “Soup”.

Is there any way for me to make a good stock? Pls help."

Cooking,"I'm having to remodel my kitchen due to a slab water leak. Insurance has ripped the whole kitchen out and now I have the opportunity to reimagine it the way I want. The only problem is we don't have 220 volt electric. We have two gas lines as our former appliances where a gas cooktop and a small 24 inch gas oven. We hated the 24-inch one and referred to it as the Easy-Bake oven because it couldn't even fit a cookie sheet. The electrical panel is opposite side of the house from the kitchen and is completely full. It's pretty old so we would probably need to update it in order to add a new 220 volt dedicated circuit. It would be very expensive to run the lines through the whole house to the kitchen as we don't have an attic since we have second floor. I've been kind of toying with the idea of getting a refurbished 48 in professional grade gas range and oven like a thermador, wolf or Viking. Usually these 48 in dual ovens. 1 roughly 27 in and the other much smaller. 

Or should I pay the expense and run 220?

Cooking,"I'm using a Phillips Air Fryer for cooking Tandoori Chicken. Has anyone else tried it and come out successfully?

All these YouTube videos make it out to be a wonder device. However, I tried it and the chicken remained **absolutely raw from the bottom.** 

**Overcooked from the top.** And will you believe it? Besides the chicken getting overcooked from the top, the **marinade was squishy wet everywhere**. When I tried to cut the chicken from the top portion all the marinade came out into my hand.

I also tried cooking french fries by coating the potato in a few drops of oil and it **tastes absolutely nothing like the french fries** from the market. Yes I did that basting shit where we boil potatoes at 60 degrees of water to remove starch and also tried deep freezing the pieces before cooking them. In all cases it made the shittiest french fries I've ever eaten.

I tried making **cutlets** and they too came out shitty. 

It feels like the Air Fryer isn't actually frying the food in any way. It just throws hot air and seems to do a worse job than an ordinary oven. In an oven at least the chicken marinade dries up after a while.

**Has anyone else tried Air Fryers? Have you tried cooking chicken in it? How were the results?**

Cooking,"So I had a dish [similar to this](https://tasteofmaroc.com/moroccan-couscous-with-seven-vegetables/) at a Moroccan restaurant (it was vegetarian) and it was absolutely delicious. While I'm not vegetarian persay, I'm trying to get more plants in my diet and limiting my meat consumption to when I eat out. This dish is just so colorful and packed with veggies, it's absolutely awesome.

I'm also pretty new to cooking (I'm aware that this is a little ambitious for a novice cook, but I figure I'll learn either way), and I'm also trying to up my protein intake because I'm trying to build muscle (at 6'3 and 180 lbs, I need a lot). Bodybuilding and tasty, hearty meals aren't usually synonymous (I don't want to eat chicken and steamed broccoli for the rest of my life lol)

So while the recipe does offer a vegetarian version, I want to up the protein. So I was thinking about maybe using tofu (since it basically takes on the flavor of whatever it's cooked in) or maybe seitan. But I'm not sure how that would go, I probably can't cook the tofu the same way she cooks the meat or it'd probably fall apart, correct?

Cooking,"Straight to the important part, pictures: http://imgur.com/a/KKYRVgA

I have wanted to put Beyond ground ""beef"" to the test with Bolognese sauce for a long time, and yesterday I decided to do it. On the blog/recipe sphere, I see a lot of vegetarian and vegan adaptations of Bolognese and the vast majority tend to go off the rails with unnecessary ingredients (well, less unnecessary if vegan) and preparation methods. The question I wanted to answer was, ""Can a classic Bolognese recipe taste comparable when swapped with plant-based meat?""

The very short answer is yes, and I'm sure it would be fine if the *only* adjustment you made was swapping the meat. However - there are two main problems I notice when cooking with plant based ground beef: fat rendering and rich flavor. If you ever scan the back of a Beyond Beef package, the macronutrient composition is almost identical to 80/20 ground beef. Texturally, the stuff definitely holds up. 

To compensate for the fat rendering (or lack thereof) as well as rich flavor I made three adjustments to Marcella's recipe:

* One clove of garlic, very finely minced, added at the end of soffritto sweating. This decision was less about adding garlic to the overall flavor profile than intensifying the other flavors in the dish, which I find garlic does very well in small quantities.

* When sauteeing the Beyond beef, I added three tbsp of tomato paste. If you've ever eaten Beyond beef, it has a faint coconut flavor. Adding tomato early, especially paste, was an attempt to block that flavor note from overpowering the more delicate soffritto, as well as adding some of that glutamate goodness early. Also - I found the tomato paste helped make the soffritto and beef juicier as it broke down in the pot, potentially compensating for some of the loss of fat rendering.

* Speaking of glutamates, I added one medium sized parmesan rind with the 1 1/2 cup of tomatoes just before simmering. I know some new age Bolognese recipes call for fish sauce (Kenji) and other umami boosters, but I wanted to preserve Marcella's recipe as carefully as possible. That meant not just throwing in any flavor enhancer I could think of. 

I served with penne because I didn't have any tagliatelle, so you could say that alone made this a bastardized ragù ;) 

Overall - a delicious meal, served alongside a simple mâche green salad dressed with a lemon vinaigrette to cut through some of the sauce's richness. I'd recommend this plant-based adaptation for anyone looking to experiment with some classics while reducing their carbon footprint.

Quick backstory - for the past couple of years i've been going to this place and have never figured out what kind of black magic they do to make their rice so amazing. A couple of months back i finally grabbed one of the nutritional booklet things, hoping it might tell me what they use - the only ingredients are rice, salt and butter. The rice has this almost sweet and sour taste, i really cant describe it, so i thought that it might come down to the type of rice they use. So i started buying every pack of rice in the store and going through all of them, playing around with butter amounts etc, but still havent been able to nail it down.  


So thats why i've come here, can one of you tell me what type of rice it is? Theres still a couple varities i havent tried that look like good contenders, for example, i havent tried Jasmine rice yet, so im thinking of trying that next. Thanks in advance!

Cooking,"Not a true fuck up, but I caused myself 3 hours of angst.

We got the meat grinder attachment over the holidays this year. First use was about 2 weeks ago and we made DELICIOUS breakfast sausage from a boneless pork shoulder. Everything worked perfectly! So, today I thought I’d try round 2 with a bone-in pork blade roast that was on sale.

I debone the roast, reassemble and chill the grinder, and everything’s great until I put in the first piece of meat. The meat was grinding, but nothing was coming out. I take apart the grinder and pull off giant pieces of fascia and sinew. Retry- same thing. About 1/2 an inch of meat grinds out before it gunks up with sinew and fascia. Of course, my first troubleshooting source is google, which tells me to freeze the meat and try to remove as much fascia and sinew as I can. I do that, and rechill the meat.   

Round 2 -same result. Now I’m doubting the quality of the roast. Maybe there’s too much sinew?? Convinced it must be the meat, I go buy the same whole boneless shoulder we used the last time. 3rd try and almost 3 hours later, still no meat coming out! Now I’m freaking out because there’s no way the machine would break after just one use!   

Luckily, at this point the husband comes home and before I’m even done telling him my tragic story, he asks me if I made sure to put in all the pieces. Lightbulb moment. I scramble for the manual and lo and behold, I forgot to put in the GRINDING BLADE. Cue massive facepalm, and now I’m stuck with over 20lbs of pork for two people.

TL;DR I forgot to put in a key component of the grinding attachment and thought it was an issue with the quality of the pork so I bought more pork. Now I have 20lbs of pork. Send help. (Or you know, recipes)

I just made my first batch of pizza dough from scratch, and honestly it sucks. I was hoping that some of you guys might be able to address some of the issues I encountered with my dough.

Firstly, it was wet. Really wet. When I mixed everything together as suggested by the recipe, it looked more like pancake batter than pizza dough. I added more flour to try and improve it but it doesn't appear to have done much. 

Secondly, it had absolutely no stretch or elasticity. I did knead it how the recipe suggested, but due to the wetness I mentioned above it kept sticking to everything and it didn't really appear to be making any difference.

Lastly, once I cooked it, the resulting pizza is super soft and floppy. None of that nice crispiness  on the bottom or crunchiness in the crust. It also tears immediately when I go to pick it up.

What can I do to avoid this disaster in future?"

Maybe its the brand, maybe it's me. But I don't get it. the directions are generally(depending on the brand) 3 cups of broth for every cup and half of rice, simmer for 20 min.

Cooking,"Last night, my husband and I tried to make a delicious pot pie out of one of our new cookbooks. We got some pie weights as a Christmas gift that are loose ceramic beads and decided to try them out for our crust.

He had premade a gorgeous cream cheese pie crust that he was so excited to use, and in our excitement, we dumped the weights right into the pie crust before noticing a fine dust all over the beads. After some internet research, we determined it was ceramic dust which is absolutely not safe to ingest and impossible to remove from sticky dough.

Crust #1 down.

After wallowing in self pity for a few minutes at our stupidity and failed crust, he informs me that he actually made a second crust to save for a later date that we can use now. We throw the first one out, wash the dust off the beads and dry them. We roll out the second crust, drop the weights in, and bake for ten minutes. When we remove the crust to pull the beads out, we realized they had all sunk straight into the crust and were now a big gooey mess that we were unable to remove without tearing it to bits, and our second pie crust was ruined.

Crust #2 down.

At this point, we have a frozen crust in the freezer we decide we have to use since we ran out of ingredients for the fresh crust. The instructions for thawing: ""Allow to thaw on counter for 60-90 minutes. DO NOT MICROWAVE FROZEN CRUST""

So here we are at 7pm on a weekday with two failed crusts and a frozen one that won't thaw nearly in time for us to eat dinner. We ended up ordering pizza and saving the filling for next week.

This morning, discussing it with a co-worker revealed that you're supposed to use parchment paper to line the crust first. -___- Of course, I should know better.

So for all my fellow cooks out there learning new equipment, here are your two hot tips for pie weights:

1) wash and dry your weights thoroughly before use
2) line the crust with parchment paper before you bake

Don't repeat my mistakes, y'all.

Cooking,"TLDR: Need to make party snacks that will totally own! 


Last year we hosted a pre game party before a big charity event, the event includes dinner and snacks so we just made cocktails and didn't bother providing any food at our house. 
Normally when we host, I love cooking and showing off, but this wasn't the time for that. Except...


This girl we invited came with buffalo chicken dip, baked filled wonton cups, baked brie (&lt;-- all homemade), cheeses, assorted crackers, and jams, the specialty ones you find near the deli. She's my SO's coworker and it was her first time at our place and my first time meeting her. Yes, everything was delicious and everyone loved it but she just... in my house... the audacity!


We have another event coming up next weekend and I won't make the same mistake. I am filled with petty revenge! I don't hate her or anything, I'm rather impressed in fact, I just got a reputation to uphold and a kitchen to defend. 


I need to make something amazing, something people will eat up, something showy. I am willing to call off work that day to spend the day cooking, I'm willing to shell out a bit more money, I'll even make a croquembouche cone if that's what it takes (really don't want to though).


Most of our friends are basic home cooks or less, so could be something that's not necessarily labor intensive or expensive.
I've made hummus before, which is not hard but people are always impressed. I was thinking about cream puffs shaped like swans, I've made it before and it looks way more difficult than it is. Also got ingredients for a smoked salmon and lettuce spring rolls.

What party snacks can I make that is sure to impress? And totally show Brittany* who runs this mother!"

Most recipes I see say to just use the blade on some garlic and lemon juice, then stream in the oil (sometimes with egg whites). But this seems like more of a whip than a chop.

Cooking,"I just ate these really good jumbo beer battered onion rings at a restaurant and they came with this incredible sweet and creamy sauce. Was looking if anyone had any recommendations for making a sauce like this. I usually eat onion rings that I make with a more ""traditional"" ketchup and horse radish based dipping sauce. But I've got a huge sweet tooth so this was really good.

If anyone has any sweeter sauce that they like with onion rings I'd take a recipe. Or if anyone would like to help me reverse engineer this sauce that'd be cool too.

As for that, I'm not quite sure what it was, I wish I had saved some more for taste analysis but alas I scraped it clean while in hunger mode. Like I said it was sweet and creamy. It was also light pink. I feel like I definitely tasted some sweet peppers or relish maybe in there.  Maybe some thousand island in the mix. It was pretty runny. I don't think any mayo, ranch or sour cream but it was definitely creamy from something.

As per the title really. On Wednesday evening both me and my partner play sport. Often we don’t kick off till 7.30 (or later) so we don’t get home till about 9.30 or so. I’m a big tortellini/ravioli fan and could eat it all the time. It’s especially handy on these evenings as the supermarket pre made stuff takes about 5 minutes and I just have it with Parmesan and olive oil. Sometimes I’ll add passatta and some fresh herbs but that’s about it. 

However the Mrs just isn’t that keen on it and when we meal plan she is always trying to put something else in on a Wednesday. Came to a head this week where we ended up cooking for about an hour after sports to make a spinach and paneer curry. Didn’t eat till 10.30.

Cooking,"I eat Stouffers Mac and Cheese at least three times a week. I want to save some money and was told that I can make it myself and it would be much better. But after three attempts I am starting to lose hope. Stouffers is much more satisfying than what I have cooked. Specifically it is the sauce that just doesn't do it for me - it seems to be missing some kind of wonderful kick that Stouffers has.

Does anyone have some advice on how to make my mac and cheese great?

I use the following ingredients:

    1 tablespoon butter
    1 tablespoon flour
    2 cups of whole milk (usually need to add another 0.5 to 1 cup of milk because it is way too thick)
    1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese
    2 cups of macaroni elbows

I use the following method:

&gt;Prepare the milk so it can warm up to room temperature

&gt;Add the butter until it is sizzling and throw in the flour. Mix constantly until tan. This probably takes 5 minutes maybe more.

&gt;Add the milk in and mix constantly. It takes a long time, at least 5 minutes maybe 10 minutes before all the flakes disappear and it starts to thicken.

&gt;Add the cheese in and mix constantly. After 2-3 minutes it becomes way to thick so I add another 0.5 to 1 cup of milk.

&gt;At some point mix some pre-al-dente macaroni elbows and stir until the macaroni becomes al-dente and then eat.

I do not have an oven, so I'm not able to broil some cheese on top. Is that the secret? If so then I am out of luck.

Everyone says you need to buy a block of cheese instead of buying pre-shredded cheese. I'm willing to try this, but I find it hard to believe that the difference between my barely adequate macncheese and a good stouffers' version is simply the difference between a block of cheese and pre-shredded cheese. 

Should I be adding mustard powder or anything like that? I did not see it listed on the Stouffers ingredients."

I have to supply dessert to feed at least 50 people for an upcoming fundraiser, for an organization I belong to. I'm very tempted to just buy something but I'd like to at least make an attempt. Any suggestions for what I could make? Something not too complicated, easy to transport and serve, that most people will enjoy.

The meal being served is Mexican if it matters."
Cooking,"My boyfriend and I are approaching a very important date for us and I wanted to surprise him with something. I thought of the mousse I described above, but I am really confused as to how to do it.

I have found a lot of different recipes for mousse. Some of them add heavy cream, some butter, some just use egg yolks, chocolate and egg whites . Problem is, apparently the more consistent version is the latter, but if I end up going that route  I don’t know how it is that I should add the lemon and lavender to it.

Please help me out here! I’d so tremendously appreciate it. Also, I don’t know whether the flavours work well together so if they don’t, please let me know!"
Cooking,"So yesterday I made some kick ass ""boiled dinner"" that I heard about from Matty Matteson's youtube channel. Came out really good. I cooked a whole chicken, some nice beef and pork ribs and onions, carrots, bay leaf and a few other somewhat expensive ingredients purchased from a local butcher block.

Once we removed the meat, there was a nice, real nice stock. I had plans for some good soup with that stock. Loaded chicken noodle soup that could make your toes curl. It was still very hot, so I let it cool on an oven mitt while we ate our fill of the meat. Afterwards, as I was putting away dinner, my wife got to the dishes and wouldn't you know? She dropped the broth in the drain. I told her specifically to keep it, but she still accidentally threw it away. Brain fart!

Anyway I love my wife more than soup so I quickly forgave her and we finished watching an anime on crunchyroll and went to bed. Because I'm not a sociopath.

Be better to your loved ones people! Have a great day!"
Cooking,"I made a marinade for london broil about a week ago, the marinade included oil. I had two steaks and the recipe included a ""freezer"" option. I threw the extra steak, and marinade, in a bag as instructed. 

Now, today, I'm thinking of thawing it for tomorrow.

The problem? The steak is rock-hard but the marinade feels like a firm slush around it. It feels like very cold oil; not quite solid, not quite liquid. 

Is the meat unsafe? The liquid reads well below freezing point (it reads &lt;10 degrees faranheit) so it's not too weirdly warm. I just worry that the liquid is a problem. Bacteria feeds in a water rich environment though, so shouldn't an oil environment be essentially void?"
Cooking,I am on the hunt for kitchen gadgets (like always) and came across the [most popular by state](https://www.empiretoday.com/blog/popular-kitchen-gadgets-small-appliances-2019/). I've never used an immersion blender in my life so surprised it's most popular.

Thanks."
Cooking,"I dont go to these very often. But everytime I do, they never season their meat. Its really simple seasonings. And then they give you a massive pile of fried rice.

Cooking,"I'm making a pineapple upside down cake cooked in a cast iron pan for a party tomorrow.

Normally I would let it sit for five minutes after taking it out of the oven, then flip it onto a plate and let it cool overnight.

I'm an American and I'll be using my mother's electric stove (not gas unfortunately) and her stove seems to burn rather hot so any guidance would be helpful. 

Thanks!!"
Cooking,"So this is a recipe my mom made for my older sister and I for as long as either of us can remember, although slightly tweaked by me over the years for various reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

* 1 can Campbells Bean with Bacon Soup
* 1 can whole milk
* 1/2 can half and half
* 1/4 tsp roasted garlic powder
* 1/4 tsp onion powder
* 1/4 tsp umami powder

So, originally my mom just used the milk and half and half, over time I started using the additional seasonings to deal with the coppery taste that this particular soup sometimes gets coming out of a can. I have researched the reason for it happening to some extent, and as far as I can tell Campbells is aware of the issue, but has no fix for it and it's supposedly not a health hazard, just an off taste.

Combine all ingredients in a stock pot (I prefer a saucier) and cook on medium low heat until it thickens, stirring frequently. I cook it until it almost has the thickness of a gravy.

I also make this ahead of time to take to work for dipping sandwiches in. When I do, I transfer the soup to a tall tupperware or jar, and blend with a stick blender until smooth because I don't care about the texture of the beans. Also, doing this results in an even thicker soup

It's absolutely amazing for dipping a grilled cheese sandwich in. I just made a smoked gouda grilled cheese to dip in it and that was even more amazing.

Enjoy!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: for spelling.

Edit the second: So, obviously this is a fairly calorie dense recipe, I'd say one can is enough to feed two people, especially if you blend it like I do because it makes distribution more easy (neither person ends up with too many beans and not enough liquid)."

Cooking,"I was trying to finish some reverse-seared pork chops the other day, but I overdid the heat and the kitchen was filled with smoke. Should the pan be at the temperature I want from the oil? A little higher? Much?"
Cooking,"I'm going to make a bordelaise sauce this weekend by following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOWWy-f4gE8) recipe and I was trying to determine when I could deglaze the pan after searing my steak to get the flavor, but also to make cleaning easier. This recipe cooks/reduces the two liquids in separate pots and then combines them to reduce again. This happens at around 6:20 in the video. Does it make sense to get the wine/shallots reduction and reduced beef stock thoroughly mixed and then deglaze the steak pan with that resulting liquid? I'd then reduce to the consistency found at 7:30.

Is this a good plan?"

Cooking,"I've heard of people putting parmesan rind into soups and stocks to get some of that flavor from the rind into the dish.  I'm planning on making a ragu alla bolognese tomorrow, and I was thinking about doing that, but that got me wondering: What is the difference between using parmesan rind versus using some actual parmesan?  I have a block of cheese in the fridge that doesn't have rind; can I grate a bunch of that into the sauce while it's simmering and get the same result?  Or is there something special about the rind that makes it preferable in this scenario?"
Cooking,"I see a lot of recipes asking you to rest your meat after it comes out of the oven/pan to let the juices disperse evenly. A lot of them tell you to leave it rest for 10-15 minutes, but wouldn't the meat be cold by then?

Do you leave it in the pan but with the heat turned off or the oven? Or do you cover it in tinfoil? Or are people having lukewarm meat for dinner?"

Cooking,"I have all day and the night before to prepare so I’m fine with a very complex meal. I’m more concerned about cost and would like to keep it to 150$. I would also like it to be a mixture of westernized Japanese and actual Japanese.

I’ve read that in Japan they don’t usually serve course one at a time, but all at once. But I will do dessert separately.


Ok so first I wanted to make a very simple soup. I’m thinking miso?

Then I wanted to do a bento box, because I always thought they looked awesome. I don’t know what to put it in but was thinking either fruit or pickled vegetables cut into cute shapes. This is something that’s meant to be refreshing.

Then a sushi platter. My partner doesn’t like seafood, so I was going to do a vegetarian platter. Definitely sweet potato but I’d like to have three options so other suggestions would be great! Do you know what sauces I should serve for this?

I don’t know if I will have the time or energy, but some sort of dumpling appetizer would be great. Any suggestions?


Finally the main meal. I’m pretty lost here. This is where I really want to “real” Japanese to shine. Some sort of curry maybe? I’m open to suggestions as long as it isn’t sea food.

Dessert. This is most fun for me. Some ideas I had were those fluffy pancakes (are they hard to make though? And I’m guessing I couldn’t make them ahead of time I’d have to step away and cook dessert? I’d rather not do that), Mochi stuffed with red bean paste or other pastes, and Japanese confectionaries (how difficult is it to make those?).


Also I’d like to make a cocktail, but not necessarily a saki cocktail. Maybe something with yuzu juice? Something with a Japanese twist.

I’m open to all of your suggestions!"
Cooking,"I haven't had a hamburger in a while because I hardly ever seem to pull it off. But I want to try again.

I've usually just fried them in oil, with plain salt and black pepper on top, and it seems to just be a matter of luck whether I fry them just enough or too long.

I want to try butter, but what else I can try to get a more interesting flavour? And what is the secret to cooking the meat properly?

(note: I don't like onion)"
Cooking,"aren't soups supposed to be watery no matter what ingredient I use they just become rock solid idk do I need to add like a lot more water ?

almost all my soup ingredients are turned into tiny tiny pieces/paste, from onion to carrots to chicken itself, Oats garlic corns etc and other stuff I add

I dont even add gelatin powder or anything like that but my soup becomes solid and almost like jelly I have to add extra water when I reheat it

I suspect it might be because I use too much material for the amount of water I use, then again  im not sure I dont wanna drink water I just want material and water mix perfectly in a balance so with each spoon you dip it's both soup watery like and carries the material

oh and btw my soups almost always turn out tasting sweet I suspect it's due to the carrot and oats,  is there a way to alter the flavor without using too much salt or other spices, like I was thinking citrus but don't they give it bitter taste if heated ? vinegar maybe idk my mom suggested tomato paste but idk

edit to clarify I dont use chicken broth that might make it jelly like

just pure chicken fillet meat (softest part of chicken breast, grounded so that it dissolves in water"
Cooking,"First, it's so easy it's crazy. Second, it's really delicious! I used this recipe:

https://carlsbadcravings.com/crockpot-buffalo-chicken/

Yes, this is an obscenely bloated page full of repeated crap, but the actual recipe is at least 9/10. I followed this to the T all the way through, up until the very last step of adding more hot sauce until it meets your taste. Truth is that Frank's Red Hot Buffalo sauce has an amazing flavor, but it's not that hot. So I not only added a bunch more Frank's to the finished pulled chicken, I also added some Tobasco. 

And as written, it turns out that two pounds of chicken will make 3 big fat sandwiches, and two baked potatoes."
Cooking,I am curious. What is the spicy oil/sauce they use for Nashville tenders after frying?
Cooking,"Please excuse the elementary question, but I'm fairly new to more ""nuanced"" cooking, and I've never done much more complex than mix &gt; heat &gt; wait.

Most of the chicken I cubed and marinated is ~.5-1 inch in size, leaning more to the smaller side.  When I finally go to cook this, the chicken will have marinated in the yogurt for ~24 hours, if that makes a difference.

In hindsight, that was a mistake, since I need to brown the chicken, but I feel like this is going to make it easier to burn.  I cooked a small test batch of it last night and I got some charring _really_ quickly, and instead of fond at the bottom of the pan, it just turned black.  

Does anyone have any tips on how I can make sure I do this right?"

How much do I love him? I love him so much I'm going to make something he HATES so that he isn't jealous about supper: shrimp.

It wouldn't matter what shrimp dish I make, so I'm making my personal favorite: Grilled garlic-lime shrimp.

Melt 1/2 stick of butter with the juice of five Key limes, 2 TBSP extra virgin olive oil, two cloves of garlic (smashed), and white pepper. (I think the butter has enough salt in it, but you can add more if you want.) Heat the grill, then dip the shrimp in the butter-lime-garlic and toss on. Grill on medium-high for about two minutes on each side. The shrimp should be just done with a good sear on the outside. Remove from heat, squeeze a bit more lime over, and devour. 

\*Disclaimer: I hate not being able to feed my husband, but I understand the importance of this medical procedure. It really is out of love that I fill the house with the smell of shrimp--any appetite he might have left will evaporate. He'll gladly drink the electrolyte beverages I've bought for him instead of wishing he could eat.


Edit 1: Thank you for the gold!

Edit 2: It worked! He was totally grossed out and lost his appetite immediately.

I've found that I love camping, hiking, and the outdoors. One of the things I really enjoy doing is cooking over an open fire or a bed of coals As I venture deeper into the woods for longer I realize I'd like to leave my cooler at home when I go hiking/camping. The thing is that I still want to make foods from at least semi-fresh ingredients rather than freeze dried or canned foods without having to lug a cooler with me. At some point it dawned on me that at one point in time many of the foods we refrigerate didn't always need to be. A long time ago or even in some places today people didn't refrigerate eggs, cheese, cured meats, milk. At some point along the way we started processing or packaging things differently and requiring them to be refrigerated to extend shelf-life. My question is what commonly refrigerated things today will actually last awhile without being refrigerated assuming they are kept in a cool(ish) dry place like a backpack? What tips or tricks are there to help prolong edibility of things without refrigeration?

I know things are processed differently all over the word, so for reference I am in the United States."

Cooking,"I'm reading a post on another forum and people are saying that lamb tastes like farts and tastes disgusting. Does anyone else experience this? I'm always surprised when people describe what they're tasting, sometimes it's completely different from what I experience.

I think lamb is delicious. I had some the other day and it was heavily seasoned with rosemary, black pepper and garlic, then cooked in a tomato sauce. I think the ""gameyness"" really helped the dish and brought out the flavors of the spices. Actually, I liked it so much, I may swear off ground beef forever, except for burgers, of course.

On the other hand, I no longer like ground beef, it doesn't have enough flavor for me. I almost exclusively cook with short rib, chuck or brisket because it has more flavor (I'm talking about beef used in dishes). If I had a choice, I think I'd always pick the lamb.

What say you?"

Cooking,"For quite a while making an authentic Alfredo sauce (parmesan and butter only, no cream) has been on my to-do list, but I've always avoided it.  

The reason I've been putting it off is because I *assumed* there was something inherently difficult about Alfredo sauce.  Surely that's why 95% of recipes you find include cream, either in small or large quantities.

Yesterday I finally gave it a try and I'm so disappointed I waited this long.  It was an absolute breeze, came together perfectly into a silky smooth sauce and was absolutely bursting with flavour.  Definitely superior to all the lame cream-based sauces I'm used to.

[Here](https://www.curiouscuisiniere.com/authentic-fettuccine-alfredo/) is the recipe I used, although it's stretching it to even call it a recipe.  Butter, parmesan, pasta water.

Cooking,"Hubby is taking the girls to a big camping gathering this weekend. (I'm staying home with the dogs, because I seriously enjoy stuff like indoor plumbing and real beds.) 

Anyway, at the last second, my dearest husband mentioned ""oh, there's a potluck, can you fix something?"" Based on the fact that I refuse to go back to the grocery store, I used the ingredients I had. Made a nice corn and black bean salsa, and ham salad*. (To be served with tortilla chips and crackers, which I had already.) 

Both of these items are leaving the house tomorrow in a cooler, to be served Saturday, and husband isn't a cook, so that limited the options. But it feels like I could be more creative next time. Ideas? 

*My husband had never heard of ham salad. It's just a composed thing similar to tuna or chicken salad, but it feels like ham is a safer option than fish or poultry for something to be served Saturday."
Cooking,"I have a few sets of Calphalon porcelain-enamel cookware (black and red) that I bought about 10 years ago. They’re still cooking as well as ever, but the exteriors have started to lose the color. It’s not coming off or anything, but they look very flat and dull, with streaks from where liquid went down the sides. When they’re wet (being washed) they look as bright and colorful as ever, but dry they look dusty/matte with very washed-out colors.

I use regular dish soap and a nylon bristle brush to clean them. Should I use something more heavy duty? I don’t want to damage them, so I’d appreciate any advice you guys can give me for how I can bring the original color back to the cookware and make them “pop” again. Maybe if I used “Bar Keepers Friend” (which I use for my copper pots)?

&amp;#x200B;

if it matters, here’s a link to one of the sets I have [https://www.kohls.com/product/prd-260883/cooking-with-calphalon-10-pc-nonstick-red-enamel-cookware-set.jsp](https://www.kohls.com/product/prd-260883/cooking-with-calphalon-10-pc-nonstick-red-enamel-cookware-set.jsp)

For some reason this must have distracted me. I barely put anything in the flour mixture and also didn’t end up browning the butter. So I served my wife a perfectly cooked piece of pork, with a flour mixture that didn’t taste like anything, and then doused it in just regular butter. 
Not great to say the least. It is now in the trash."

But I don't feel like it makes my knife that sharp (maybe I'm not passing through the fine sharpener enough?). So I was at the discount hardware store and I saw [this stone](https://www.hardwarestore.com/mintcraft-silicone-carbide-oil-stone-8.html) which I bought. This was my first time using a whetstone, and I proceeded to ruin my knife edge. After looking at the grit, which I definitely should have done before, I found that it is 120/240 grit. The knife did have some chips near the tip, so I guess it's not the worst thing in the world to have this stone? Anyway, did the stone ruin my edge because I suck at sharpening or is it not the right stone? Also the package said that the product may contain lead or other chemicals that are harmful... the stone is silicone carbide so I shouldn't be too worried right? I'm thinking if I really want to learn to sharpen a knife I should do it on a cheapo one and not my wustoff. Any advice is appreciated!!"

Cooking,"Basically title. I have a mess of chicken bones I've saved and I'd like to turn them into stock. I also love cooking food from every part of the world and a lot of different regions have recipes that call for stock. Here's where I run into problems. If you look at the different types of stocks from around the world, each has their own flavour profile.


Chinese and Japanese stocks use ginger, garlic, green onions.


Korean stocks call for peppercorns and mushrooms.


Thai stocks usually have cilantro and a splash of fish sauce.


North African stocks have some lemon and tomato.



Viet stocks have a wild mix of spices.


I tried making Tom Kha Gai with stock that had used the traditional French/Western mirepoix and it fucked up the flavour profile of my whole soup. Is the solution to make just straight up chicken water, and then add aromatics to it to make a ""double stock""? Is there a recipe that can function as a basic stock to add to depending on the aromatics I need?"
Cooking,"Going to to make split pea soup with ham but I saw some pics where the ham had a nice glaze or caramelization.  I was thinking of lightly baking or broiling it, just enough to get a good crust with minimal cooking, then cutting it up to finish in the soup.  But then only the edges will get a crust.  Are there better ways I can get more of a glaze to area ratio or just better ways to prep the ham in general?"
Cooking,"I'd been toying with this for a while but kept putting it off because I've always had ground spices/spice blends in the house. But I've become obsessed with Thai food lately and decided to just go for it and it's the best kitchen investment I've made in years. Four days in I've used it every day and the satisfaction of toasting and grinding whole herbs and spices is amazing. Beyond that, flavour is like the difference between preground black pepper and freshly ground, only with every spice."

Would mixing in carrots and celery help, or going with fresh tomatoes instead of the cans of diced/paste?  Are there other sauces you would recommend for something like this?  I've thought about trying for more of an alfredo sauce, but I'm worried that it will end up too cheesy (crazy idea, I know) and I feel like it needs something else to round it out, since the manicotti are already stuffed with multiple types of cheese.

Is there really anything wrong that can happen for my sweat and tear-filled dish. 

And how can I tell if my noodles are finished cooking?"
Cooking,[Here](https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/d8whor/after_8_years_of_failures_tweaks_etc_i_have/) is the recipe I shared a couple months ago.

Cooking,"My husband has requested empanadas with chimichurri sauce. So I'm planning to make basic beef empanadas but I figured while I'm at it, I'll make a variety and freeze for quick lunches/snacks later. What are your favorite fillings?

Cooking,"My roommate and I made meatloaf last night. Mainly savory or umami flavorings, no ketchup or milk, just eggs, garlic, sautéed onions, unseasoned bread crumbs, 1 teaspoon fish sauce, dash of Worcestershire sauce etc.

Then we cooked it with two strips of bacon on top, and at the end we glazed it with a mixture of aged balsamic vinegar and brown sugar. Just enough balsamic to dissolve about two tablespoons of brown sugar. It was amazing.

Anyone else tried this?

Cooking,"I have been using Diamond Crystal Kosher salt for years, and suddenly in the past couple of months, it is suddenly not available at any stores in my area. I have been to probably 20 or more grocery stores, walmarts, targets, and any other place I could think may have it in stock. No one has stock, and either the shelf spots are no longer there, or have a ""temporarily unavailable"" tag on them.

I did see that there were rumors about 1 year ago that they may discontinue it, but they were quickly squashed by the makers. 

Is any one else running into this issue? I have today conceded defeat and purchased 3 boxes from Amazon."

Cooking,"I decided to make an amaretto semifreddo and while the main body is soft and white, there is a layer at the bottom that's a different type of ice and is brown.

I whipped up some heavy cream (about 500mL) with a tablespoon of sugar first.  I then whipped 5 eggs and 1/3 cup of sugar until 3/4 done.  Put in 2 tablespoons of amaretto.  Then I continued mixing until stiff peaks.  Once I had stiff peaks, I folded in the heavy whipped cream.  Froze in glass container.

I can't tell if the layer at the bottom is amaretto that's frozen or if my whipped eggs separated.  

The whole thing is delicious though.

Any advice?"
Cooking,"I'm going to do a some venting, so please bear with me. TL;DR at the bottom. 

My husband and I have been together for 10 years. I can count on two hands the amount of times he has actually prepared and cooked us a meal. I do love cooking, and I've become good at it. He isn't bad by any means, and I've really enjoyed all the meals he has made.

I'm growing increasingly frustrated with his lack of help in this area. He won't clean any part of the bathroom because he has a ""thing"" about germs; he won't take the trash out for the same reason; he doesn't take care of the cats because that was our agreement for getting them (it was); he won't take care of the dog for reasons unknown; he won't do any cleaning of the fridge or sink; and he won't cook because his reasoning is that I like to do it. 

Don't get me wrong, he does clean. He declutters, vacuums, sweeps, mops, does the laundry including mine, and is responsible for doing the dishes after dinner, among other things, but I don't know that he realizes what a chore it is sometimes to cook after a long day. I asked him to make dinner the other night after a particularly long day and he declined. It was literally just tacos and took me less than 30 minutes start to finish, but he said that I'm ""better at it"" and like cooking (so clearly I must want to every day)? I tried to explain what a luxury it is to be able to relax from the time you get home til when you go to bed while I'm in the kitchen for anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour and a half, but he doesn't really get it.

Finally today (which is actually our anniversary) he asked if I wanted anything on his way home and specified he wasn't picking up dinner because I should really cook since I had a day off. For reference, the reason I had a ""day off"" was because someone broke into my car and shattered my windshield, so my ""day off"" was filled with police reports, taking myself to get my window replaced, and then working from home in between.

TL;DR I am really, desperately in need of very, very quick recipes. Like under 30 minutes. He will not eat leftovers. He will not touch anything that's been reheated. He doesn't like soups or stews except chili because he doesn't like his food all mixed. He also will not eat mushrooms."

Cooking,"Hey guys!

Disclaimer: I'm fairly new to cooking so bear with be please.

A few weeks ago I made a butter chicken dish that was ok but it was unbearably hot. The recipe I was following called for kashmiri chili powder, which I did not have. None of the grocery stores near me carried this pepper so I went googling to try and find a substitute and I read somewhere on a blog that you can substitute 1:1 cayenne powder for kashmiri chili powder. I don't think this is true because the dish was very hot and did not taste anything like the butter chicken I'm accustomed to eating at restaurants. Are there any viable substitutes for kashmiri chili powder? Thanks"
Cooking,"This is a long shot, I know. But a few years ago, my husband and I read an article in lucky peach that we didn’t realize was fantasy. It was about finding a hidden restaurant I think on an island with a chef—the descriptions of the food and these fantasy ingredients was so magical. It was so captivating and it wasn’t until the article ended that we realized it wasn’t a real place. I want to say the chef was Asian. There’s a chance it wasn’t in Lucky Peach but I feel about 80% sure it was. Thought it was worth a shot in the dark...

Some more details: my husband and I both remember the fictional chef as being Asian, he’d worked in a lot of restaurants and the author had to travel to find him. He was underground, had to go through a tunnel to get to his restaurant.

Could also be mcsweeneys. Year was around 2013. It was printed in a magazine.

UPDATE!: found it!! My husband wrote the editor Peter Meehan thinking it was a long shot and he not only responded BUT HE WROTE THE ARTICLE! It’s in the Chinatown edition of lucky peach and he’s going to send it to us. I’ll post here once that happens.

UPDATE 2: here is the article. He sent us a PDF of the whole magazine so I had to extract the pages and put them in imgur. Hope you enjoy! It was definitely the most wonderful when I initially read it as real:

Cooking,"So I was talking with a coworker about cooking, and we got on the topic of marinades. Now, for beef and chicken I know how to make a wine/vinegar based marinade, which I then do a reduction with after I cook the meat (in the same pan of course). 

But my coworker sometimes uses more creamy marinades and I don't know how to cook those into a sauce after words, just reducing them doesn't seem right but they've touched raw meat for a prolonged period, so cooking them seems like a really good idea. Any suggestions on how she can not waste the creamier marinades?

Also, she cooks with pork way more than I do and is interested in how to make a marinade for pork. I think you could use either red or white, depending on what other flavors you are adding (my instinct says red for spicy or pungent, white for herbal/light flavors), but she'd love any recipies. 

My problem is that I don't really do recipes so much as ideas, and adjust on the fly. This is fine if you are comfortable with it, but she is more comfortable with following a recipe. Of course, the disadvantage of my style is that the same dish never comes out exactly the same twice. Which is good if you make a few dishes a lot, as they don't get boring, but you are more likely to suffer disappointing results."
Cooking,"I don't like recipes that I need too many ingredients for. Often I have too much left of a single ingredient and have to throw it away.

Cooking,"So recently I’ve taken notice, when i drink espically, i have a bad habit of leaving cooked food out for ridiculous periods of time before i eat it. For example, the other night i made chicken legs and let them sit on top of the stove for 3 1/2 hours before i ate them cold..i regularly do the same thing with ground beef, fish, etc...this has me wondering, are the regulations surrounding food storage in today’s world largely exaggerated? I’ve been doing this for decades and have never once gotten sick. Random post, but I really am curious to know, can some people handle spoiled/bad food better than others, or is the whole “dispose of cooked chicken after it’s left out for 2 or more hours” and such all a huge exaggeration for our overall safety?"

Cooking,"So for New Years I wanted to try something new and decided to cook with wine for the first time. I used [this recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2019/12/red-wine-braised-beef-short-ribs-recipe.html).

I followed the recipe exactly, but was pretty disappointed with the way it turned out. The flavor was just kind of, gross, to me. It was better when I would take a bite of potato with a bite of meat, as the potato would help to mellow the flavor, but it was definitely not what I was expecting. 

My father-in-law, on the other hand, loved it. He is retired but used to be an exec and would often eat at fancy restaurants for business meals, and said that the meat reminded him of something he would have gotten at a nice restaurant (just like the recipe said).

Do I just have an immature palate? I don't drink so this was my first time tasting wine. Does it just take some getting used to?"

Cooking,"Screw it. I'm setting up a diet plan for myself and brown rice is healthier than white. So I gave up my white rice that I love for this brown uncookable trash. 
Im using an instant pot and day one with a 1:2 way to much water after 8 mins in an instant pot and uncooked tasted terrible. Regular rice takes 4 mins in an instant pot and is delicious. 
So today I do 1:1 1/2 still all water. I rinsed this Bs I did everything right and this is what I get. Totally useless not fluffy rice. I've lost sleep over this at this point. I'm boycotting brown rice. Hey you don't wanna cook properly so you can be eaten? Fine. Hopefully the human species cuts you out of existence.

Edit:
Ok I actually just now repeated the first scenario that worked in the end. This was with 1:1 1/2 ratio. 
Cook the rice for 4 mins (6 mins works too apparently) then release pressure fluff even if it's watery. Then recook in instant pot for whatever the remainder will be to add to a total of 8 mins. Fluff cover then it's perfect. I'm calmer now."

Just moved out and started cooking my dinner on weeknights and my meal prepping meals on Sunday and it feels exhausting and tiring. It usually takes me twice as long to prep/chopping the ingredients and simple things like organizing my work space so that I don't make a mess, coming up with ingredient lists and shopping for them and constantly rereading the recipes is very challenging.

I understand it makes sense since I am just starting but what advice would you give out to get over this learning curve? Start with simple recipes? Take shortcuts (eg: buying presliced mushrooms vs. whole)? Thoughts?

Its also very tough doing this all after a long and mentally draining 8-5 job."

Cooking,"Hello,

I'm a fairly inexperienced cook and only do really simple recipes. I used to rent a house, I made hot dogs on the stovetop in a pot with boiling water. They would come out perfect, looking nice and with a good consistency. I recently bought a house and new cookware. The stove in the new house is pretty old but it still heats up well and it is also a glass stovetop just like the old house. However, now when I make hot dogs they get really swollen and are kind of squishy. They're cooked and taste fine but the texture is weird now and as I said, they swell up. 

What would be the difference when cooking the exact same way that would cause them to come out differently?"
Cooking,"Hey guys. As you know by the title I will tell you some truths about all cooking TV shows that you see on TV and some of the things that I will tell you will BLOW YOUR MIND. 

First of all, I want to acknowledge you by the fact that I was in a cooking TV show (won't mention which one for not tracking my identity ). I am telling you this because I for once have been wondering how do they do that so perfectly how that and how that. Many mysteries but no answers. Here you go

**First of all.** The way you get into a show is either you get called ( to get called you must be found by them by your ethnic background or get recommended ). You cant just sign up and voila. 

**2.** You won't be called and oh hey ok come. You will get a lot of calls. Meetings. Different things that you cant and can do and it will all be stressful. I almost quit halfway into them accepting me for the show.

**3.** **YOU NEVER EVER EVER** get to cook something by yourself or just out of nowhere. What I mean ""just out of nowhere"" when you see those mystery boxes and in most cases, people get from the judges what they cook. That is **FAKE**. They notify you in advance of what you will cook so you can prepare. This got me blown away btw.

**4**. When going on the show. You have to get dressed by them, makeup by them, you have to shower, you cant wear electronics due to those little microphones that everyone has. 

**5.** When going on the show you will have a guide telling you where to go, what to do while on it and a lot more stuff. This is not every time just when entering, leaving and similar actions.

**6.** RETAKING SCENES. Yes, we retake scenes. And a lot of the scenes that are normal are left out. Judges can always stop the scene but you cant

**7.** You know those moments when chefs look like they are describing the scene in a room full of things like ""I am stressed out don't know what to do hope I win this"" while not cooking. Those are done when EVERYTHING ends. Literally. You have to wait to do that and then you can say that and they tell you what you will be describing etc.. Knowing this I always look at the body language to see who won and not. 

**8.** The rewards ( money etc. ) Is given a month after. Yes, this is sad but it is how it is. They also give out bonus things like pans, food, etc."

Cooking,"It's become an annual thing for the SO and I to host a small brunch get-together to celebrate a joint birthday party for our 2 cats. It's more of an excuse to invite people over and get a little tipsy on Bloody Mary's and Mimosas. Historically I leaned into preparing more lunch oriented food with some snacks on the side, but this year I want to get a little more variety on the breakfasty side. 

My 1 rule is that I refuse to do a casserole. I hold myself to a higher standard than to rely on an egg based casserole, besides I'm not a huge fan of them anyway. 

We are on the fence whether are going for a seated meal or buffet style. Depending on the exact headcount will determine that, but I'm down for ideas catered to either. 

I have a few weeks yet to prepare but I'd like to do a few test runs of things before hand just to avoid any surprises. 

Thank you in advance."
Cooking,"The other day I made a shrimp gumbo following the recipe that Issac Toupes outlined on an episode of Binging with Babish but something caused it to be almost gravy thick. This was my second time making this recipe and while this one was exponentially better, its consitenticy wasn't... gumbo... 

Only thing I figured would cause this was too much our or not enough stock, which I dont think was the case, as the rue came out perfect from what I thought.

I had a few different ingredients this time, is opposed to last time, as this was a shrimp based gumbo. I used Modelo instead of Guinness beer, small batch 4 Rose's instead of wild turkey, home made shrimp stock instead of canned chicken stock/broth(can't remember), and as mentioned shrimp, instead of chicken and sausage. I wouldn't think the consistency would changed by any of those changes. 

Any ideas what caused this consistency change? My only guesses are the rue or simmering the gumbo itself too high, causing liquids to evaporate."

Cooking,"I am in the process of tweaking a ""power waffle"" recipe I found online(it was *edible*, but I am pretty sure I can make it better). 

The original recipe
+ 6 eggs
+ 2cups greek yogurt
+ 2cups rolled oats
+ 1/2 tsp vanilla
+ 1 tsp baking powder
+ pinch salt

Combine in a blender and puree till smooth. Made 4 waffles in our waffle maker, and half of one fits our toaster, and have like 160cal and 13g protein.

They were a tad too tart and dense for my liking. I am thinking of adding a couple tbsp of honey to the batter to sweeten it up a bit, an I am thinking of separating the eggs, beating the whites(soft peak?), and folding them in to the batter to lighten it up. Does this sound like it would work? And does anyone know of any additions to add fiber that are Crohn's friendly(my better half has Crohn's, and was told to avoid things like chia and flax seed)

Also, can anyone give me the approx weight of 2 cups rolled oats. I am going to use oat *flour* for the second batch(since I am hand mixing) and would like to get the conversion right. I can do it myself when I get home, I was just looking for a ballpark figure."

Cooking,"Korean Fried Chicken is one of my favourite food and I've spent the past few years creating something that's close to what's been served in Korea. Because I want everyone to get cooking, I have posted a video on how to make 4 different types of my favourite Korean Fried chicken. For anyone interested, here is the link: [https://youtu.be/ggCmosKSvvw](https://youtu.be/ggCmosKSvvw)

But in Summary

Ingredients for Fried Chicken

* Chicken
* Pre-made frying mix (or mix flour, cornstarch, baking powder, garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper) 
* Full fat milk (why are you making fried chicken with skim fat milk) 
* Vegetable oil
* Salt
* Pepper
* MSG

Tips and tricks

* The longer you marinade the chicken in milk and seasoning mixture, the better chicken will taste
* MSG is required if you want to replicate that restaurant quality taste. You don't need much, but it might be the most important ingredient in this recipe
* Shaking the wet battered chicken in the dry batter gives that wavey crispy texture, I've tried to just rub it on and it completely changed the texture
* Do not crowd the pot - if you do, you will get well oiled steamed chicken rather than crispy fried chicken
* All my measurements are in portion sizes rather than tbsp and cup sizes. Because this way, you can make this without using the measuring tools

Enjoy :)"

Cooking,"Hello all. I am hoping one of you might have a recipe or any idea what these are properly called.

My grandmother passed many years ago but I have fond memories of Sunday dinners at her house.

One of the things she used to make was a type of dough based ?stuffing? for her turkey. She called them strudels, I believe, and they were not at all like the flaky pastry that I find when I google. The only real things I remember is that it was delicious, savory and apparently a lot of work as the dough required stretching many times over.

Any ideas on what this was actually called or how to make it?"
Cooking,"So I roasted a whole chicken in roasting tray with onions, carrots, garlic and celery underneath. 

Once it was fully cooked i removed the chicken to rest and collected all the drippings and juices from the tray and poured it into a small pan. I simmered it on medium heat, added a bit of stock and flour and finally a dash of butter near the end.

I'm not sure what I did wrong but the gravy ended up totally separating, it became a totally clear liquid with chunks of brown? 

Any advice as to why this happened?"

I'm posting here as this is pertaining to my cookware and I have no idea where else to put this. My wife bought me a wok so I can make large dishes for us and company but, when I started making chicken last night, the chicken started to turn pure black as if it was coated in pure oil.

I tried washing the thing and scrubbing it hard with a brillo pad but there always seems to be this black stuff coating it inside and out. The link I provided shows my finger after I rubbed it against the outside of the wok. You can see the ""brand"" (even though I'm 100% sure it's just a Chinese knockoff) and any other information needed I can provide.

She told me she bought it at a Marshalls (kind of like a slightly more expensive Ross with greater variety), if that matters."
Cooking,"Hello! My Grandparents lived in Germany for a number of years, and one the dishes they loved was a Red Stroganoff. 

My grandmother has tried for literal decades to get the recipe right, but says it has never tasted the same, and she's about given up, being 82 years old.

She wants to make it one last time, so I thought I'd reach out to the internet with hopes of making contact with someone who lives, lived there! 

Thanks for reading, and if you have an answer, be as specific as possible!"
Cooking,"I wait to know good  **grain:water** ratios for making larger quantities of long grain white rice, brown rice, and rolled oats. I usually go by volume but weight is ok, too.

I currently use x : x+1 cups for long grain white rice (for anything 1c or more, I use x : 2x for less than 1c) and that seems to work well.

I use x : 2x for 1c of oatmeal but want to make more and that gets to be a lot of water fast.

Brown rice is just a mystery to me.  Recommendations online also say x : 2x but again, a lot of water fast.

Thanks for your help!"

Cooking,"I have a pretty large quantity of hacho miso. For those who don't know, hacho miso is a very dark, dense, and almost crumbly mostly-or-all soybean miso with low sugar content and an intense flavour. I have been looking for uses for it for a long time, and have only found one or two online: a sauce for breaded cutlet and a sauce for eggplant, IIRC. I have tried using hacho miso in soups, but they come out unpleasantly strong and dark tasting. I have also tried it in glazes for fish, but lighter/sweeter/softer misos seem to be better for that application too. Is there a way for me to more effectively use hacho miso in the ways I described? What are some other uses for the ingredient?

TLDR: what tasty things can I use hacho miso for?"

Cooking,"Good day folks! I have a very specific request that I hope this large subreddit can help with!


There is a chicken restaurant in Seoul, South Korea called Mattacco. They have a very unique baked chicken offering that I have been trying to replicate (on the menu it’s 현미베이크 translated as brown rice bake chicken). Does anyone know of some recipes to help point me in the right direction? I believe it is baked with a certain type of brown rice, because I tried standard medium grain and it didn’t turn out well. Would the rice require cooking before? The texture of the chicken is similar to Rice Krispies.


I haven’t been to the restaurant in years, but if you happen to be in South Korea, I definitely recommend this place. By far the best chicken I’ve had in my life (they have many other flavors, not just plain). [Here it is in all it’s glory.](https://imgur.com/a/P2xsRmJ)"
Cooking,"I use a flat or bumpy mallet to pound chicken breast thin between 1/4 - 3/4"". When I do, the shiny/smooth side of the muscle breaks loose from the interior of the muscle.

It's unexpected and not good. What am I doing wrong?"

Cooking,"Simple syrups. I don't know why I never bothered before. Send me suggestions you have enjoyed - both for syrups or uses for the syrup!

So far, I made:

* plain simple syrup

* cinnamon syrup

* orange syrup

* pineapple syrup

All of these are mostly used to sweeten beverages, such as coffee and *jamaica*.

I made the pineapple one based on the seriouseats recipe, and am now attempting to extract some from orange rinds (the recipe was for lemon, but I figured I'd try). I am loving it! Except for the time I put in ny coffee into the crystalizing cinnamon syrup, and ended up with coffee so sweet, I had to throw away, even after I dumped shitty office coffee on top. Yeah, underestimated the amount big time.

Background:
It started with thr boring task of trying to mix sugar into my jamaica. So much work. So I made simple syrup. It was cool. So I wondered if a flavored version would be nice. It was. I make about 1.5 cups a batch, and it lasts me about 2 weeks. 

Orange syrup:
I made this by boiling orange rinds. It has a nice subtle flavor. I tried a piece of now-candied rind, but it's not my thing. I am also trying the seriouseats recipe where you just dump some sugar to pull the flavor from the rind. I'll have to compare, but the one I boiled had a subtle flavor, and I expect the sugar one will be stronger.

 I guess mango will be next for this method.

Cooking,"2lbs raw peeled shrimp 
10-15 whole pepper corns 
20-25 chiltepin chiles 
5- chiles de arbol 
5- chiles piquin
3- serrano chiles 
2- cucumbers 
1.5- red onion
3 avocados 
1- garlic clove 
Tostadas
Mayo
Kosher salt
Black pepper
10 large limes

Butterfly and wash the shrimp. Put them in a 13""x9"" baking dish or similar and spread them out evenly. Add kosher salt and black pepper. (I dont have a actual measurement for the amounts, season to taste. Also you will use more salt and the whole pepper corns later so not too much.) Cut 2 lemons and squeeze over the shrimp mixing it all up. Peel the cucumbers and cut them in half length wise. Using a spoon remove the seeds.  Cut the cucumbers and thin slice the onions and add to the shrimp. Take 2 of the serrano peppers and slice them into rounds. Add them to the shrimp and  mix it again adding a little more kosher salt and pepper. 

In a blender add all of the chillies, garlic clove, pepper corns and the juice from the remaining limes and blend it until everything is dissolved. Taste the mix and add kosher salt if needed. Add the mix to the shrimp mixing it all up with the lime juice that was already in the shrimp and put it in the fridge for about 20 min.

Put some mayo on a tostada pile on the shrimp with onions and cucumbers and top it with sliced avocado. https://imgur.com/bM886Xx.jpg

Cooking,"I just wedged my potatoes and forgot to peel them first. Is this a problem, or can I push forward with my curry?"
Cooking,"I tried my hand at making Thai green curry for the first time today. My recipe was basically heat a bit of oil, then add green curry paste (storebought, Mae Ploy), a couple cloves minced garlic, and maybe 2 teaspoons of grated ginger until aroma came out and it started to look a bit dried out (no browning). Add a can of coconut milk, cup of chicken broth, green beans , and simmered about 6 or 7 minutes, then add tspn fish sauce, bit of sugar, and eggplant and cook a few more minutes. Then added snow peas at the end for 2 or minutes and stir in lime juice and Thai basil leaves (can't find Kaffir lime leaves anywhere). I'm really happy with consistency, veggies, and spice level but it's too salty. I have a bunch of ingredients left and will definitely try again but I'm wondering if I could leave out the fish oil? I suspect the Mae Ploy paste is just really salty and I used salty store bought chicken broth instead of some way less salty I have frozen. Anything else I could do to cut down saltiness? Thanks!"

Cooking,"We all have one (or more).

Here's a classic of mine.   I decided to make homemade pizza for my then-teenaged daughter. It was a spur of the moment decision, but I  had all the ingredients, including homemade sauce and grated mozzarella in the freezer.

We assembled the pizza together, topping our creation with sauteed veggies and sprinkling on cheese from the unmarked Ziploc freezer bag.

The time went off but the cheese wasn't melted yet. 

I gave it more time. Still not melted.  Strange.  The crust was getting pretty brown, so I stuck the pizza under the broiler. Nothing.

We were quite hungry, so we pulled it out of the oven. She took a bite, looked at me in astonishment and blurted out: ""POTATOES!"".

The unmarked bag contained shredded potatoes, which looks quite a bit like mozzarella. 

We were still laughing so hard that we were crying when the pizza delivery guy arrived...

I label my bags now."
Cooking,"I have a decent understanding of combining flavors and a few techniques etc, but a pretty poor understanding of temp control and what I feel like is conflicting results. This happens to me seemingly at random regardless of using aluminum, stainless, cast iron, and carbon steel.

Eggs- seemingly random. Heating up slowly sometimes is great, sometimes sticks. If I preheat for a while to a med heat and then dump in, browns a little and USUALLY releases fine, but occasionally sticks horribly. 

Searing in ci- heat on high for a long time, pour in some high temp neutral oil, usually grapeseed, then put in food. If searing meat, usually sticks somewhat, but will come up eventually. This seems to follow the whole ""if it sticks, wait. It isn't done yet"" thing. However, there is usually carbon buildup, and so subsequent pieces tend to stick horribly and have some of this carbon buildup in them.

Sauteeing- usually goes fine as long as things are moved intermittently. However, if I try to get some browning on stuff and let it sit in place a min or so, it will get some color, but things begin to almost gum up and begin to stick. Seems to be opposite of ""if it sticks....""

Really unsure of how I should be preheating and oil temp and how long (if at all it matters) oil is at temp before adding food, etc. Thanks in advance"
Cooking,"I pick up my daughter from daycare at 5 PM and put her to bed at 7 PM, after which my husband and I have dinner together. Thankfully I work from home so I can do some dinner prep during the day to help make sure we eat at a reasonable time (e.g. before 8 PM).

\[Before anyone asks, my husband definitely does his fair share of the housework and child-rearing - for instance, he gets up with her in the morning and takes her to daycare and does all of the dishes after we're done eating. I love to cook and hate waking up early so this is the best setup for us currently.\]

Anyway, here's what I'm making tonight:

[*Moroccan-Spiced Fish*](https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/browse-all-recipes/moroccan-spiced-fish)

* *12 small carrots, halved lengthwise if large*
* *1½ pounds fingerling potatoes, halved lengthwise*
* *1 lemon, thinly sliced*
* *½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper*
* *3 tablespoons olive oil, divided*
* *1¼ teaspoons kosher salt, divided*
* *½ teaspoon ground cumin*
* *½ teaspoon ground coriander*
* *⅛ teaspoon ground allspice*
* *4 6-oz. skinless cod fillets*
* *3 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley*

*Preheat oven to 425°F. Toss carrots, potatoes, lemon, pepper, 2 tablespoons of the oil, and 1 teaspoon of the salt on a rimmed baking sheet; arrange in a single layer. Roast until potatoes are almost tender, 15 to 20 minutes.*

*Meanwhile, stir together cumin, coriander, allspice, and remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a small bowl. Rub the mixture evenly over cod and season with remaining ¼ teaspoon salt.*

*Remove baking sheet from oven and increase heat to broil. Nestle cod fillets among vegetables and return to oven. Broil on top rack until fish is just cooked through and vegetables are tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Top with parsley.*

Tonight I plan to prep and season the veggies ahead of time, place them on a baking sheet, cover them, and keep them in the fridge. Then I'll take them out of the fridge and preheat the oven during the kiddo's bedtime routine so that as soon as she's down I can put the veggies straight in the oven and proceed with the rest of the recipe as written

The types of questions I ask myself are: Will the veggies dry out in the fridge? Will their texture be compromised by being preseasoned? Which proteins (e.g. fish, pork) are negatively affected by things like preseasoning and acidic marinades?

I'd love to hear your make-ahead tips and tricks for getting fresh meals on the dinner table in good time! Thanks in advance!

Most recipes I see are between 4 and 10 hours. Would it be worth it to invest in a better slow cooker that has an auto shutoff/switch to warm so I can cook something for 8 hours and then let it switch to warm for the next 6? Or would that be too long? Or would I be able to set it for a lower heat and just leave it cooking 14 hours?

Cooking,"I've tried several recipes for tomato-based salsa and they all seem to come out bland to the point where I have to add a bunch of extra salt. Only once have I made one that was super delicious but I can no longer remember what spices I used :(

Cooking,"Hey all, coming to you with a question about slow cookers which i know little about.  


Over the years when i wanted to cook a tender stew i would cover the lid of my pot and cook at a very low temperature for around 3 hours. This would keep the meat juicy while making it very soft and the stew would ultimately ( for the most part ) be a success.  


I am however curious about the benefits a slow cooker might provide. How is it different and do i really need one to elevate my cooking or is it just a marketing thing that i can do without?  


Cheers to all and happy cooking : )"

Cooking,"I have 500g mince, how do I make a taco ( it’s mince in a flatbread isn’t it).
I’m a competent cook living in rural England- I’ve no idea about tacos- I’ve never had Mexican food. I have access to a range of the most common spices, and very basic veg. Flatbread wraps I can buy. Where the he’ll do I start?
UPDATE.
I kinda riffed around a bit- mince, onions - I’m sorry I used cumin and paprika and the oregano was actually wild Greek marjoram. 
They were okay. I think the others enjoyed them but I’ll pay for the spice ( a teaspoon of Chilli powder) at 2am. 
I will be trying the Piccadillo someone linked me to- less spicy perhaps?"

Cooking,"The space only allows for a 24-27” double oven.  We would prefer to go with the bigger 27” oven but selection is extremely limited because no one seems to make a 27” oven.

That and GE does not have the best financial outlook, but from what I’ve read GE appliance division has been sold to Haier in China.. also not reassuring.

I was all about going to Bosch/Kitchenaid as a more affordable well known brand till i started reading those reviews ... bosch convection fan apparently sounds like a jet engine and kitchenaid not being what it used to.

Jenn-air i was told to avoid completely

Anyone have any experience with either of the brands i listed?  Any other I missed? Do these reviews hold water? are all appliances these days overloaded with unreliable technology? Or am i looking too far into this.

Cooking,My mom makes a killer beef dip that utilizes flank steak. I’m curious if I could replace the flank steak with petite sirloin.

Cooking,"I once bought a cook book with Marlboro miles back in the nineties. I still use it to this day. It's called the ""Cook Like a Man"" cookbook and it focuses mostly on grilling. I never expected a free cookbook from a cigarette company to actually be good, but it is. It's not for sale in the Marlboro miles store anymore, but it's not too expensive to get a used copy on E-bay or whatever. They have this one recipe where you core apples, stuff them with nuts, cinnamon, butter and various other things. Then wrap them in foil and grill them so the stuffings soak in. Those are always a big hit with the family at Christmas. It's also where I got my favorite BBQ sauce recipe. If you like grilling I highly recommend it. It's not often that I like something, so when I do I try to pass it along. I hate everything, so if I like it you know it's good. I found it on Amazon for $19 if anyone is interested. https://www.amazon.com/Marlboro-Cook-Like-Man-Cookbook/dp/B000AMAYOK

Edit: Honestly the only thing bad about it is how they printed it. The cover is see-through except for the text and the background is on the second page. The pages are thick like posterboard and super glossy and smooth. Something about how they made it caused it to start smelling like chemicals as it aged. So keep it in the closet when you're not using it. Other than that it's a fantastic book."

Cooking,"I usually have extra virgin olive oil and refined olive oil in the pantry. I've generally used the refined stuff for cooking and the extra virgin for raw applications, but have started questioning whether the refined stuff makes any difference in cooking. 


I don't think it imparts any olive oiley flavour I can notice (probably mainly because the refined stuff isn't very flavoursome to start with), so what's the point? Perhaps I should just be using extra virgin olive oil when I want olive oil flavour in cooking (a cheap version when cooking...) and neutral oil when it doesn't matter.


There seem to be conflicting views on this amongst chefs, with some saying it's a waste to cook with extra virgin olive oil and some seeming to use it for everything.


Any thoughts? What do people in olive oil producing countries do?


P.S. appreciate in the US there seems to be a whole other issue where refined olive oil isn't actually made from olives a lot of the time but in the UK that is not an issue as far as I'm aware."

Cooking,"My friend just made this video about one of her cookie recipes, and it's so good. 

Here's the video on how to make it: [https://youtu.be/DSTm3aku29I](https://youtu.be/DSTm3aku29I)

Here's the recipe:

INGREDIENTS \* 2 cups + 2 tablespoons all purpose flour 

\* 1 teaspoon baking soda 

\* 2 teaspoons cornstarch 

\* 1 teaspoon salt 

\* 1 ½ sticks (6 oz) butter, melted, browned and cooled 

\* 1 cup dark brown sugar, lightly packed 

\* ½ cup granulated sugar 

\* 2 large eggs 

\* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 

\* 1/4 cup dark chocolate chips 

\* 1/4 cup milk chocolate chips 

\* 1/4 cup white chocolate chips 

\* 1/4 cup caramel baking chips 

\* 1 tbsp flake salt  

INSTRUCTIONS 

1. In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt. Set aside. 

2. In a small sauce pan, melt butter over medium heat. Swirl the pan occasionally. The butter will foam and eventually turn a golden brown color.  Remove from heat and let cool. 

3. In a large bowl, beat together the cooled melted butter and the sugars with a hand-mixer or stand-mixer for about one minute. Then, add in the eggs and vanilla extract. Beat until just combined. 

4. Slowly add in the dry ingredients and mix briefly, just until there are no flour clumps left. Fold in all of the chocolate and caramel chips. 

5. Cover and refrigerate the dough for at least one hour (the colder the better). 

6. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and preheat the oven to 350°F, making sure you have the racks in the middle of the oven. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. 

7. Scoop 1/4 cup of cookie dough at a time and roll into balls. Place at least 2” apart on the baking sheet.  

8. Top each ball of cookie dough with a pinch of flake salt. 

9. Bake for about 10-14 minutes, rotating half-way through, or until the cookies have spread out and the edges are golden, but the centers of the cookies still look soft and undercooked. Every oven is different, so watch closely and cook them to your preference. 

10. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets until the cookies are firm enough to remove, about 15 minutes. Before they are completely cooled, you may add more chocolate chips by gently pressing them into the cookie. 

11. Repeat with remaining batches, until all cookies are baked.  

12. Enjoy!"

Cooking,"Everyone swears this dish is so easy, and every time I try it is an absolute failure. (Well, it's edible, but it's not *good*.) 

Regardless of the recipe I use, the sauce just doesn't want to form for me: it turns into this thick (but also watery--it's not homogeneous) mess that sticks to the bottom of my stainless steel pan instead of the pasta.

New question: can I make a praline topping without nuts? Just brown sugar, butter, corn syrup,cinnamon, and nutmeg? My toddler isn't supposed to be allergic to pecans, but it looks like she developed another nut allergy :("
Cooking,"This only started about 6 years ago. When I cut onions my eyes start burning, but it just gets worse and worse until tears are pouring out, my nose is running like crazy, and my eyes are on fire and I can barely crack my eyelids open for more than a quarter second. It takes about 15-20 minutes for it to calm down enough to open my eyes comfortably. Rinsing with water doesn’t seem to do much. It’s even when I walk into a kitchen where someone else was recently cutting onions. A few days ago my wife and I were walking in the mall and my eyes started burning. My wife said she kind of smelled onions. This never used to happen. My eyes would burn a little if I was cutting onions, but now it feels like some full fledged allergy attack (I’ve never been allergic to anything). Has anyone else had something like this develop much later in life?"
Cooking,"So it’s 1 in the morning and of course i’m wondering about how this salmon I had a month ago was prepared.


I can’t remember the name of that he restaurant but I had this huge skinless salmon that was sooo melt in your mouth soft I’d swear it was steamed or something along the lines, but the top was crispy to the point of a slight crunch and the whole thing had such great flavor, more pungent with the crunch ofc and it’s been bothering me since, what technique would i use to even make such a thing ?

Thanks !"
Cooking,"Why isn't the format for online recipes standardized?  There should be a standard method of listing the ingredients and a format for including them in the instructions.  Recipe apps would then be able to create shopping lists, double, triple, half the recipe, etc. more accurately.  I use a cooking app and it does help but I always need to edit the shopping list (for example, lists 15 large eggs and 8 eggs, 3lbs ripe Bosc pears and 3 Bosc pears).  Also, if you double the recipe, you need to remember that the amounts in the preparation descriptions will not be doubled.

It's a pain when entertaining for large groups.  We have the technology, why hasn't it happened yet?  OK, rant over."

Cooking,"I'm not sure how much this is actually specific to Japanese, but that's where I see it the most.

Whenever I've gone to a hibachi style restaurant the chefs/cooks are constantly tapping their utensils either on the hot plate or around the cart they have with them. I was just watching a video of a chef in Kyoto and he was doing the same thing - before he would add an ingredient to the frying pan, he tapped the spatula on the surface, then again on the pan itself.

Is this in fact a Japanese thing or am I just noticing something that's not a thing?"

I assume it's going to be like eating some kind of black forest honey ham chimera. I got some cube steaks for chicken fried steak there. Usually being a big city guy, I've never been to a real butcher shop before. I got 7 of the biggest cube steaks I've ever seen in my life, a shaker of bacon seasoning, and a pound of sandwich turkey for $27, so the price isn't bad either and the meat is better than the grocery store.

I've had pretty good luck with semolina noodles holding up all day when making crock pot Mac n cheese for cookouts etc. Should I go that route? Make my own noodle? Just send along an extra smaller jar of uncooked egg noodles?

Cooking,"I've done a bit of research on this question, but I haven't come up with a definitive answer. Maybe /r/Cooking has some thoughts. 

I have a a set of 20-ish year old ""hard-anodized nonstick"" Kirkland cookware. It's functionally equivalent to the Calphalon stuff but thinner. The interior Teflon cooking surfaces are intact and are still largely intact because I'm the only one that cooks in our house, but the matte black finish is degraded after several runs through the dishwasher because nobody else in my house respects HAND WASH ONLY. If it fits, it gets dishwashered.  

The damage is cosmetic, but it's still annoying. 

I'm familiar with using E-tank tanks to strip and restore cast iron.  My question is, has anyone tried to restore a hard anodized finish using an E-tank? Would you care to share obs and practices?

Now every person whose labor creates the free recipes I enjoy wants to act like some kinda individual human with their own thoughts and feelings? It's fucked up. I don't care enough to wonder why this trend exists, but here's the bottom line: It is affecting ME and MY INTERNET TIME. I have to scroll for an extra 5 seconds and that is extremely frustrating! 

Listen, free recipe people, we had a deal. You would spend lots of your own time and energy and resources developing content that I want. You post it online completely free at no real benefit to yourself other than maybe some skimpy ad dollars. I then read your recipe with adblock on, leave no comments or ratings, and if you are EXTREMELY lucky I will make it for someone else then tell them it is my recipe. You cannot beat that kind of exposure. 

We had something pure and beautiful then you sold out to the man. Now you're writing these articles about your personal life just because it's the only way to have your posts show up on search engines and not get buried? You're making them long because the only tangible benefit you could get from doing this relies on duration of ad exposure? I thought you were better than that! 

Please. I am begging you. There is a human cost to what you are doing. I have not been able to see my wife and kids for six months because I am so busy scrolling past personal stories before recipes. One day my kids are going to ask why they grew up without a father. I will have to tell them it is because you chose to write a cute anecdote about your dogs before telling me how to make chicken quesadillas. Do you really want that on your conscience?"

I read that it's actually a good idea to freeze the burgers in their forms because then they're more likely to retain it during cooking. Dw I'll get a better spatula as well.

For I gredients I like to go simple with salt and pepper however I've been thinking of adding soy or mushrooms to help enhance the flavour. Feel free to leave anymore ideas underneath."
Cooking,"Hi there,

I hope I'm not repeating a question but I couldn't find a similar thread. I keep hearing about Instant Pots and how great they are but I'm not convinced I need another appliance for my kitchen. 

I work 9-5 so the idea of having a good dinner on the table quickly is appealing to me. Does it really help with this? What's with the hype? Why do I need one? 

It seems like there is a huge variety of models, at varying prices, 6 in 1, 7 in 1, 9 in 1... How do I know what to choose? I only cook for two but I love making huge batches so I'd lean towards the 8 quart I think.. Any advice is appreciated, I'm totally overwhelmed by the selection. 

One more question, can an Instant Pot replace my slow cooker? That would free up the space in my kitchen but does it have the same capabilities?

Thank you in advance!!"
Cooking,"So I just recently took it upon myself to try and teach myself some basic recipes,  and I decided that I wanted to bake some chicken legs. The reason that I didn't opt to roast a whole chicken is because I was intimidated by the carving. So I watched a bunch of videos on YouTube to learn the process and I came upon dry brining in order to get crisper skin and a more tender inside. However, I was thinking about seasoning my chicken with Old Bay. Is it possible to dry brine chicken with Old Bay? And if not how would I go about brining the chicken while seasoning it? I'm scared that if it's not possible to brine it with old bay I'll end up making the chicken way too salty. Help is appreciated!"
Cooking,"I have been learning how to cook over the past year. people tell me I have gotten pretty good at it. my fiance' is super appreciative and loves everything i cook. problem is, i hate everything i cook. i find it repulsive. it could be the best tasting thing i've ever made, and i'd have no interest in it. it's starting to depress me, because i spend so much time and money on these dishes that my fiance' will eat from for days, and all i can do is watch him eat it. when i finally go out of my mind from hunger, ill just go to McDonalds and eat chicken nuggets. if my mom or someone else makes food, i'll usually enjoy it. i just can't seem to get past this psychological barrier and i've never been more unhealthy and hungry in my life.

has anyone else ever experienced something like this?"
Cooking,"Maybe this is about cooking. Maybe not. Since cooking is such a personal emotional thing for many of us I'll take the risk. Let me know if this doesn't belong here.

I have said the final farewell to all of my grandparents and my parents. When they died we all sorted through their belongings and chose a few things to keep. Most of my selections were from the kitchen. My mom's mom provided a pastry blender. My dad's mom a little screen sieve. My mom provided a few items, the most special to me is a little aluminum measuring cup that she always had in the flour canister. Lots of memories came along for the ride with that measuring cup. It is now in my flour canister and I think of her every time I use it. It is still usually painful nearly three years later but I will always keep it in the canister. Tonight it was eggplant parmesan and the breading needed some flour. I both hate and cherish using it and am missing her a lot right now. I wish I could post a photo of that simple measuring cup in this text only sub; you'll just have to imagine it.

If there's a point to this post I suppose it is to encourage everyone to cherish and make time for the important things in life with people and cooking being at the top of the list.

EDIT I totally forgot about imgur. Thx for the reminder u/drunky_crowette.

Here's a link to a pic of the aforementioned measuring cup:  https://imgur.com/gallery/4Tqq5De

EDIT2 it seems cliche but I really did not expect such a big response to this post. I have two general comments. First, there must have been a really successful ad campaign mamy decades ago that persuaded the mothers of the day to use this specific cup for flour. I can't believe how many commenters have stated they have the exact same cup in their flour. Second, I suppose awards and karma are nice, but what is most meaningful to me is how this post has connected so deeply with so many people and in some cases helped them move forward a bit in their grieving process. It has been healing for me to see that happen. ❤"

The fizzing continued for about two minutes and has now settled. Obviously I haven’t consumed any, and had a shower to try and get any off me.

Cooking,"It's winter where I live. Cold weather and grey skies make up most days. I've been finding myself drinking too much coffee as of late and never feel like drinking tea. However, I'm very rarely not in the mood for a spicy, warm cup of chai tea. The thing is that I'm not too crazy about most store-bought brands of chai.

Cooking,"I stopped eating meat about 2 years ago and I'm completely happy with my decision. To get more protein, I've tried to incorporate more tofu into my diet, but I just can't stand the taste.

Usually people say tofu doesn't have a taste at all, but that's not the case for the tofu I've cooked. I'd be completely happy if it had no taste, because then you can completely change the flavour by marinating it differently. But for me, it just tastes bad. 

Am I just weird? Are there other people that just can't stand the taste? Did I just buy the wrong kind of tofu? 

I tried different cooking methods, I've fried it in oil, I've pan fried it, I've baked it, I marinated it with different things, and I was actually really impressed by how much you can change the texture and how much flavour you can pack in there, but the 'tofu taste' that J hatte still remained."
Cooking,I’m making my first ever batch of home made pasta and the dough is currently resting so I have 30 minutes to decide which will go better with home made pesto. They’re the only attachments I have for my pasta crank so which should I go with?
Cooking,"I've always been confused by the ""classic"" way of cooking pasta: Using lots of water, making it as salty as the sea, and then setting a bit of cooking water aside for adding it to the sauce. For me it made no sense. So I came up with my own way of cooking pasta. 

1) Using far less water. All noodles have to be covered of course, but adding a lot more has no benefits. They won't stick together if you stir from time to time. By using less water, you get a higher concentration of starches.

2) Not salting the water for the first 5 minutes (that is, if you use normal noodles with a cooking time of about 10 min) and reserving some of the UNSALTED pasta water. 5 min are enough for the salt to penetrate the noodles, you won't taste any difference. 

3) Adding most of the unsalted pasta water before and letting it further reduce in the sauce; this again increases the starch concentration. Still don't use all of your reserved water so you can regulate the consistency of the pasta with the sauce later, dry pasta is BAD."
Cooking,"Hello!

One of my most favorite recipes is [this fettuccine alfredo](https://www.recipetineats.com/one-pot-chicken-alfredo-pasta/)!
I make it for family and friends a lot, and they all really love it!

The biggest issue that I have though, is that the sauce isn’t creamy like traditional alfredo. Instead, it looks a bit like cottage cheese and causes the pasta to stick together a bit.
I’ve made this recipe hundreds of times, and it always turns out the same...

Is there anything that I could be doing differently in order to make the sauce more creamy? Or is this just how it’s supposed to look?
Thank you for the advice! It tastes delicious either way! :)"
Cooking,"About 5 or 6 years ago, I made some lamb rogan josh and ended up with far too much leftover spice rub. I didn't want to throw it all away, so I stuck it in a ziploc and labelled it. The problem is, rogan josh is not something I make often, so it sat there for a while until I started incorporating it in other dishes. Over the years, I've dipped into it and added things back in so often that I have zero idea of what is in there anymore, but it is many generations past anything resembling rogan josh.

I started doing this for convenience and thriftiness, but I feel like it has helped me become a better chef (even if the practice isn't very chef-like). Every time I'm considering using it, I'll smell the bag and try to figure out what's in it, and decide whether it will complement my dish or if I should add any leftover seasoning into it.

Am I the only one who does this? Do you consider this poor practice? What would you guess is in your mystery blend?"

Cooking,"Fir Christmas my mother gave my kids a bunch of ""easy menu ethnic cookbooks"" a library was getting rid of.  They are great and kid friendly.  We tried the Cooking the Italian way last week and it was a huge hit.  We went all out made a 4 course meal and broke out the fancy dishes and came as close as I was able to create a true Italian table.  I would love to give the Japanese culture as much accuracy as I can as well, but I have much less experience with Japan and its culture.

We have a large low coffee table and I figure i can get us some pillows to sit on.  I ordered some chop sticks, I know they wont be able to use them, but figured it would be fun to try.   It says to use a variety of small dishes, I am a bit of a china ware horder, so that is doable.

The author of the book did not give me a simple menu, she says to just pick some of each category and chose thing with different flavors, but I really do not know what each food is going to taste like.  The menu I am going with so far is: 

Green tea, I cannot get loose leaf here

Basic Clear soup, I ordered Dashinomoto (this will be completely new) (O-sumashi)

Sesame seed dressing with Broccoli (Groma-ae)

Rice

Chicken in a Pot (Mitzutaki)  with soy sause/lemon for dipping and chives, ginger root for garnish

Anyone on here from Japan? Or of Japanese decent? Can you tell me if this is a close example of what might be ate during a nice meal with family?  Is there anything I might add (way out in the middle of no where, so it will be hard to get much but I would be happy to know for maybe next time)  My kids range from 7 to 2, but only the 7 yr is really picky, she will eat the chicken plain.

On both my attempts, I start with 20gr water 20gr flour on day one, discard about half and add 40gr water and 40gr flour on day two, and keep adding about 1tbsp flour and water every morning


The first one fails after about day 5, with about 3ml layer of hooch, smells bad (vomit inducing) , and almost no sign of bubbling. Granted I didn't know it was hooch and that you need to discard it. I threw attempt one since I can't revive it. 

My current batch (attempt two): on day one there's a little bit of clear water layer after 12h.I just stir it back in. On day two, about 6h after feeding it triples in size! On day three, I notice it looks like it's not active. when I open the jar, I can feel the air rising up to be quite warm, which I thought must be normal. There's a little bit hooch, and it smells like acetone (which worries me) . I discard the hooch and the top layer of the starter, added 40gr flour and 40gr water, and about 6h later, there's almost no change in size, with a little bit hooch. It smells acetone, but doesn't feel vomity

- mix everything
- put inside a vapor cooker

Recently decided to try something different and make a French onion soup (almost an hour of stirring onions just to prep, shoot me). Turned out great except for one thing. It was really sweet. I'm not a big fan of sweet things. No French onion soup I've ever had before was sweet like that.

Now I'm looking to you amazing people to help me out. Was it the onions? Was it the sugar the recipe called for? Can I leave the sugar out and let the onions caramelize in their own sugars?

All of these recipes come together in like 20 minutes and are almost impossible to mess up.

#The Ingredients

1. **Whole peeled canned tomatoes.** The best tomatoes are generally what end up whole in the cans plus they don't have any firming agents that can keep them from cooking down nicely. imo no point in springing for San Marzano most of the time. I'd recommend Muir Glenn in the US or Mutti in Europe. Keep a few cans around always—obviously they're not going bad anytime soon.
2. **Tomato paste.** The tubes are handy if you'll be using little bits somewhat frequently. I think ATK recommends Cento for this one in the US. I use Mutti again in Europe.
3. **Garlic.** It's garlic. You know the deal. Keeps for a couple weeks at least somewhere cool and dry.
4. **Yellow onions.** Yellow onions are mildest and best for cooked applications imo, but feel free to use white or red if that's how you get your jollies. Also keeps for a couple weeks.
5. **Shallots.** Even milder than the yellow onions. In a pinch, you could use onions in all the recipes that call for shallots. Or shallots in all the recipes that call for onions if you've got that Rockefeller money *Also* keeps for a couple weeks.
6. **Lemons.** Nothing fancy needed. Just plain old lemons. If you like the zest, maybe spring for organic. They keep a week or two in the fridge.
7. **Heavy cream.** Heavy cream or heavy whipping cream both work—just make sure it's not sweetened. Generally lasts about two weeks.
8. **Parmigiano reggiano.** Get the real stuff in its whole form—no ground up shit. It can be DOP if you want but doesn't have to be. There's plenty of great parm out there that isn't DOP-certified (but none of it it sold by Kraft). I personally prefer a 24-month most of the time, but a more complex 36-month has its charms too. It'll last quite a while wrapped up in the fridge.
9. **Pecorino romano.** Another grating cheese, but quite different from parm in flavor. While parm is more about nutty umami, pecorino brings more saltiness and a hint of tang. I'm probably in the minority here, but if both cheeses were in a burning building and I could only save one, I'd save the pecorino. You *can* substitute them for each other in a pinch but, like I said, they're not all that similar.
10. **Guanciale or pancetta.** Guanciale can be challenging to find outside of Europe, but it's worth the effort to track it down. (I think you can even order it on Amazon). It's fattier, sweeter, and milder in flavor than pancetta, but pancetta is much easier to find so you can sub that if needed. You can freeze either for quite a while. Just cut into thickish slabs (roughly ¼"" or 0.5cm) and separate with wax paper then keep it in the freezer. You can cut it into lardons straight from the freezer (it's way easier that way actually) and use it without thawing.
11. **Vodka.** Alternative uses: getting you drunk. Lasts forever.

I'm also assuming that you have some real basics on hand already. Namely salt, black pepper, chili flakes, olive oil, and butter. You'll need the actual pasta too. I recommend De Cecco across the board.

#The Recipes

1. **Basic tomato sauce/arrabbiata.** (Tomatoes, garlic, parm, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). My basic quick tomato sauce is actually based on [Serious Eat's arrabbiata recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/02/penne-pasta-arrabbiata-sauce-recipe.html). If you don't like spice, you can dial the pepper back as much as you like. This works with just about any shape. Penne's a classic, but casarecce might be my fave. Also great on [homemade gnocchi](https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/03/technique-fresh-ricotta-gnocchi-fast.html).
2. **All'amatriciana.** (Tomatoes, onion, pecorino, guanciale/pancetta, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). This is hands down the king of pasta sauces in my book. The pork fat takes everything that's great about tomato sauce and turns it up to 11 with minimal added effort. I use Marcella Hazan's recipe, which you can find [here](https://cookingfrombooks.com/2014/05/12/pasta-allamatriciana-2/). The only alteration I make is I render and crisp the pork first (starting in a cold pan) and *then* add the onions. idk why Marcella never seems to brown meat. Bucatini is supposedly the classic with this, but in Italy I've seen it much more with mezze maniche and I prefer it that way. That's a tough shape to find though, so you can sub something like rigatoni.
3. **Alla gricia.** (Pecorino, guanciale, black pepper, olive oil). Alla gricia is basically the midway point between all'amatriciana and cacio e pepe. Once again, I think the pork really improves on cacio e pepe. While it's fine to sub pancetta in the last recipe, I think this one suffers a bit more from the substitution. I recommend the [Serious Eats recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2018/11/pasta-alla-gricia.html). As with all'amatriciana, mezze maniche or rigatoni is the move.
4. **Cacio e pepe.** (Pecorino, black pepper, olive oil, butter). Is it as good as alla gricia? Despite being much more well-known, I'd say no. But sometimes you can't find guanciale or just can't be assed to render it. Cacio e pepe to the rescue. Once again, [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/02/spaghetti-cacio-e-pepe-recipe.html). Keep in mind that legit pecorino is very salty, so don't oversalt the pasta water. If all pecorino is too much for you, experiment with using part parm. Spaghetti is the way to go for this one.
5. **Alla vodka.** (Tomato paste, shallot, heavy cream, parmesan, vodka, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). Somehow this sauce hits all the exact same comforting notes as boxed mac and cheese (I mean that in the best way possible). I really like the [Bon Appetit](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/fusilli-alla-vodka-basil-parmesan) recipe. Fusilli is awesome with this, but the classic penne also works.
6. **Al limone.** (Garlic, shallot, lemon, heavy cream, parm, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). A break from the tomato-y cheesy porkiness. This is one of my favorites. I use the [Cooks Illustrated recipe](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/videos/1731-spaghetti-with-lemon-and-olive-oil-al-limone) (non-video is paywalled) but add some garlic, chili flake, and a bunch more lemon juice. I skip the zest and herbage. Use spaghetti for this one.

Finally, a couple honorable mentions: you also have all the ingredients here for **aglio e olio** and **alfredo**. I don't personally like either all that much, but I know lots of people go gaga over aglio e olio especially. Try 'em out if they sound up your alley. If you keep eggs around, you could also do **carbonara.** Again, not my fave, but you do you."
Cooking,I've never made curry before so I was looking for the easiest one to start with.
Cooking,"Chinese New Year is coming up.  What better way to celebrate than to cook and eat with family and friends.

I called up my mom and asked her for the recipe.

Dumplings

* 1 lb of ground pork
* 1 cup of cabbage (not nappa) diced
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 clove or garlic (minced)
* 6 scallions (whites cut up)
* 1 tsp sesame oil
* 2 TBSP soy sauce
* 1 tsp Chinese cooking wine
* 1 package of round dumpling wrappers (about 35-45 per package)

Dipping Sauce

* 1/2 cup soy sauce
* 1/4 cup Chinese Chinkiang black vinegar
* 1 tsp ginger (cut 2 thin slices into very thin strips)

&amp;#x200B;

Chop up the cabbage and put in a big bowl and mix in the salt.  Let it sit and wilt a bit.  My mom said that this makes it softer for mixing. Let it sit while you prep the other ingredients.

Combine the ingredients for the dipping sauce.  The ginger will infuse the sauce nicely. :)

Mix pork, cabbage, garlic, scallions, sesame oil, 2 TBSP soy sauce, cooking wine in a bowl until well combined.  Make a small meat pancake and fry it in a skillet.  Taste test and adjust seasonings.

Now it's time to wrap. Use about a rounded teaspoon of filling per wrapper. (YouTube has some really good videos).

To cook the dumplings:. Add about a 1/2 TBSP canola oil to a non-stick pan. Add the dumplings, one by one into the pan...make sure to rub some of the oil in the pan onto the bottom of each dumpling.  Add about 3 TBSP of water.  Cook, covered, on med to low heat for about 7 - 9minutes.  (I usually like to use lower heat in my cooking so that I don't burn my foods.)  Check to see that the dumpling skins look steamed through.  If not steamed through, and the pan is dry, add another TBSP of water.

Once the dumplings look steamed through, take the cover off and turn up the heat a little to crips the bottoms.

Plate the dumplings on a big plate and serve with the ginger dipping sauce.

Enjoy!

Happy Chinese New Year!  May the new year bring you health, prosperity and happiness."

Cooking,"I’m making dinner for my dad tonight (chicken francese) and I’m serving roasted eggplant (sliced in rounds) as a side. I’m pretty positive my dad has never had it so I want to make it great. The problem I have with eggplant is that it sometimes stays floppy/soggy when roasted in the oven. When using those gigantic purple eggplants, I salt and sweat them for 30 min before roasting. Tonight I’m using a graffiti eggplant I got from Kroger. I’ve heard this type doesn’t need to be salted/drained before cooking. Is this true? How can I make sure the surface of the eggplant gets pleasantly crisp? Usually I brush (try to do so lightly) with olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and then roast on a cookie sheet or other shallow pan for 30-40 min, flipping roughly halfway through. Is there anything I can do to help my eggplant crisp up?

Thank you!!!"

Cooking,"Hi Reddit! This is my first post on this sub but I need help from you guys who actually know how to cook well.
I'm from the UK and my partner from South Korea is coming over for the first time in 2 months for a few weeks. If you guys didnt know it's VERY expensive in South Korea to buy fresh ingredients such as meat, vegetables and dairy and there's little chance to try non-Koreanified Western food. My partner is very excited to come over to the UK so that we can cook fresh meals together to save some money for other travels (The UK is quite cheap for groceries). He knows I'm still learning how to cook and I have a few basic dishes I can whip up and some of my other cooking I'd eat myself but I don't feel confident cooking for other people.
I want to surprise him and learn some new recipes before he comes! Preferably Western cuisine he can't get over there (although pretty much anything non East Asian would be fine). I also just need to learn to cook in general.
I'd really appreciate some advice on cooking for a noob like me and some recommendations for easy and impressive recipes and some kitchen basics eg what essential spices would you recommend me to have? (Where I live we have standard British supermarkets, Eastern European markets, Chinese markets and a Middle Eastern supermarket). If you were having Western food for the first time what would you want to try? I've been scouring the All Recipes app all morning but I can't tell the difficulty and I don't trust Pinterest after bad past experience :/

Cooking,"I realize it isn't peak Reddit time, so I'm probably going to have to figure this out on my own. But I've slightly charred the soup part of a big batch of chicken and dumplings (fried my alliums to the bottom while cooking the dumplings-d'oh!) Thankfully I was cooking the dumplings in the broth first to store separately, so the veggies and chicken are unaffected. 


My question is this: is there any way to save the broth? It only tastes slightly charred, it's not strong at all but it is noticeable. I'm ideally looking for something I can add that will hide the burned flavor while still tasting like a proper thick chicken soup."
Cooking,"If anyone is having second thoughts about weird looking fungus, let me settle your doubts. Having come from a poorer upbringing with unhealthy parents, I've been closed off to the world of vegetables that are not frozen peas/carrots/potatoes. Since moving out a few years ago, I've been eating significantly better and exploring what's out there slowly. Let me tell you what, I bought Shiittake mushrooms the other day and had an eye opening experience I will never forget.

I cooked them in olive oil, garlic and balsamic vinegar and thought I was in heaven. I meant to post a picture but I ate them too fast. If anyone has other recommendations as far as recipes with them, I would love to know. They're going to be on my grocery list forever."
Cooking,"I'm looking for inspiration! All my family and friends know I enjoy cooking (and especially baking), so for Christmas and birthdays I often get gift cards to my local kitchenware shop. Grateful as I am, the problem is I'm now at the point where my kitchen is pretty well stocked, so I'm running out of ideas and the gifts cards are accumulating faster than I can spend them.

It's a good opportunity to replace my cheap electric hand mixer with a fancy one (KitchenAid maybe), and I'd still have a fair amount left over for some fun stuff. Or I could spend it all on something cool and expensive, but I've already got the obvious big-ticket items, like a stand mixer, casserole dish, etc.

So let's get super indulgent: how would you spend big money at the kitchen shop? Would you get into making your own cheese or ice cream? Upgrade all the old utensils? Get yet another gorgeous bundt pan or serving platter? Le Creuset oven mitts? A few grams of saffron or powdered vanilla? Bring me your ideas!"
Cooking,"I was looking for a dish that would be extremely cost effective without being tasteless and decided black beans and brown rice with some seasoning would fit the bill. I referenced a recipe online for seasoning ideas, calling for 1 tsp of cumin, 1 tsp of chili powder, and 1/4 tsp of both salt and pepper to be added to 2 cups of beans just a little before they were done cooking. After the beans were done cooking, I put 2 cups of brown rice in with the beans, seasoned it the same as I had for the beans (the reference recipe I had used was only for seasoning the beans so I thought I'd add more to help the rice as well) and cooked the rice. When I went to taste it, everything was cooked perfectly fine, the beans and rice both tender, but it was incredibly bland. 

I ended up doubling the total amount of the seasonings little by little trying to get any semblance of taste out of the mix before I made a hail-Mary at fixing it and added about 1 tsp of garlic powder and 2 tsp of seasoning salt. I normally avoid using this particular seasoning salt because it seems to very easily overpower anything else it is with, but it did give the mix a fair bit of flavor and make it at least edible.

So the advice I wanted to seek out here would be

1. Is there any particular reason the cumin and chili powder would make no profile of their own in this? Far too little seasoning used? Or maybe those two seasonings just won't add any real flavor without more than rice and beans in the dish?
2. What seasonings would any of you use to get the most of simple black beans and brown rice?

And if needed for clarification, I used dried black beans I had soaked for 8 hours and rinsed before cooking and I made sure to thoroughly rinse the rice beforehand to remove starch. The beans had enough leftover liquids in after they had finished cooking to get away with adding about 1/2 cup water to make sure the rice had enough water."

Cooking,"I just wanted to share a couple of cooking anecdotes that really made me feel good over the weekend.

Last week, my youngest daughter (who is 13) kept talking about how she wanted to make a ""healthy meal"" for the family. So, on Friday she decided on making a stir fry using [this handy info-graphic that I show to everyone who is interested in making stir-fry.](http://imgur.com/gallery/HfWH4tt) She took chicken breast, asparagus, broccoli and baby corn and stir-fried it perfectly with the orange ginger sauce recipe. Everyone (meaning my wife, her older sister and my) thought it was really good and she was very proud of herself. I only gave a couple of cooking tips during the process, but she did all the physical work.  It was a pretty great feeling.

Fast forward to Sunday evening. We'd had a big after-church meal and my wife was at her monthly book club, so we weren't going to have any sort of family dinner. At one point in the evening, I saw the leftover broccoli and asparagus in the fridge and resolved to do something with it before it went bad. So, I just put it all on a baking sheet together, hit it with some olive oil, salt and pepper and roasted it. Now, whenever I normally cook broccoli, I always just steam it. The kiddos like that and I've never roasted it before. They've had roasted asparagus before and were luke warm on it. 

When it was done, I told them about it, left it on the counter and then went into another room. I didn't really expect them to like it, but when I came back into the kitchen a little while later - the baking sheet was empty. They'd devoured it all and were asking me to make roasted broccoli again soon. It was a pretty great feeling, knowing how much they liked that - and that it was fairly healthy.

tldr; Cooking with and for family can be pretty rewarding."

Cooking,"I’ve read a couple of posts about guilty pleasures and childhood dishes. In the same general idea, what are some foods you hate, bonus points if you feel like that makes you feel kind of guilty, like you should love it.

I have a couple. I can eat most things, although I tend to stick to the stuff I love, but I have a few foods that I cannot accept that I hate.

1) Curry. On paper, I should like curry. In real life, the smell of it makes me nauseated.

2) Kale. I want to like it. I love Swiss chard, spinach, arugula, etc, but kale feels like chewing on construction paper, no matter how many times I try to like it.

3) Tuna. Now, this one is probably the one that I feel weirdest about because I love fish, and I will eat a tuna salad sandwich 7 days a week. I cannot stand rare tuna, and it used to drive my dad crazy to the point he wouldn’t cook it for me because I wanted it overcooked.

I use either corn meal or semolina on the surface before putting the pizza down on it, and to be fair, the pizza doesn't stick and there are no off flavors, but frankly I find the sticky surface to be kind of disgusting.  It's discolored and tacky.  I haven't put any oil directly on it, but the pizza dough has a bit of oil in it, and I guess that's what's leeching into the stone.

Cooking,"question 1: so i saw a recipe for a sauce to top grilled cheese. its more or less a red wine, flour, butter, and rosemary reduction (maaaybe olive oil was in there?). its drizzled on top i assume. Is this actually good on grilled cheese or is that guy strange? 

 Q2: i was gonna make a grilled cheese with pesto on it, but i had trouble deciding on cheese(s). I ended up deciding on mozzarella and camembert to give it a milky creaminess and a funky earthiness respectively. The pesto would add the tang / sharpness both those cheeses lack. should i change a cheese to something else? something more sharp like cheddar? im still new to... cheese..

Q3: so then i thought, why not put that red wine sauce on the pesto grilled cheese? give it that sweetness and tartness that it lacks... and also some red onions or sautéed yellow onions for extra crispiness. is this going overboard with flavors? 

im just in a very anxious situation rn, and this thinking is helping lol. if anyone can help alter these silly child’s-dream ideas to be better, id love that, then i’ll actually make them later. thanks :)"
Cooking,"So I wanted to show you how to make a classic noodle dish from Yibin in the Sichuan province – burning noodles.

Now, upon seeing the words “Sichuan” and “Burning Noodles” in the same sentence, I can probably guess where your mind’s headed. Yep, these noodles are indeed pretty spicy. But no... that’s not actually why they’re called “Burning Noodles”.

The ‘burn’ in burning noodles is a translation for the character ‘ran’ (燃) – which means to light, or to ignite (e.g. the flash point of an oil is referred to as its ‘ran dian’… literally translated, ‘ignition point’). Why ‘ignition noodles’? Well, they’re got the name because… they’re not a soup noodle dish. So much not a soup noodle dish, in fact, you could theoretically take a lighter to them and the noodles would burn in front of you (note: don’t do this, waste of noodles).

Now I know that feels like a hell of a commitment to the concept of ‘not soup noodle’. But you can find this sort of explicitly not-soup noodle dish in old trading towns up and down the middle to upper reaches of the Yangtze river:

1.	[Wuhan, Hot Dry Noodles](https://i.imgur.com/c1tKXua.png).  Wuhan is the last major city right before the three gorges area of the Yangtze river (criminally under-rated food city). One of their most iconic dishes is “hot dry noodles”… the dry referring to the fact that – again – this is not a soup noodle.

2.	[Wanzhou, Zajiang Noodles.](https://i.imgur.com/D9sQGpg.png) Up the river a bit, after the three gorges area – a proper city in its own right, though technically a ‘district’ of Chongqing today. Named so because it was historically place where “a myriad rivers converge and a myriad traders gather” (万川毕汇、万商云集) – though a good chunk of Wanzhou today lies beneath 150 meters of water in the reservoir created by the three gorges dam. One of their famous noodle dishes is called ‘Zajiang Noodle’ (not to be confused with the Northern ‘Zhajiang Noodle’), which’s some dry noodles topped with meat sauce.

3.	[Chongqing, Mala Xiaomian.](https://i.imgur.com/LfYRJYl.png) Historically the focal point of trade in the Sichuan province. Their noodle dish of choice is the fiery xiaomian (‘small noodles’). While historically these noodles were always served dry, today you can find them either dry or in soup.

4.	[Yibin, Burning Noodles.](https://i.imgur.com/7wrLyXO.png) Yibin lies at the Yangtze’s highest navigable point – at the intersection of the Yangtze and the Min river (the latter going up to Leshan – home of the Leshan Giant Buddha – and Chengdu). 

So. Why do all of these places have dry noodles? Even though these cities span three different provinces, they were all *so* influenced by the Yangtze river trade that there’s this… similarity to the cultures there that’s hard to put into words. They’ve all got this… ineffable toughness to them, and these river towns were some of the first in the country to use chili pepper extensively. Some people say that dry noodles were originally popular on the docks because, well, rocky boats aren’t exactly the best place to scarf down a soup noodle. Or perhaps it’s a climate thing. Or maybe, I dunno, they just liked their noodles sans soup for the same reason people in the West generally eat noodles dry – they just… liked them better sometimes. I dunno.

Now of course, this is one of those classic street food sort of dishes, which means its paradoxically (A) simple to serve but (B) time consuming to prep. The way I’d personally sort this logistically would be to sort all of your ingredients in advance (on the weekend or something) and toss them in the fridge. Then the remaining cook time is like… five minutes of work max, so it makes for a great quick snack or an easy dinner, that kind of thing.

So I’ll be splitting this up into three sections. First, ‘stuff to prep in advance’. Second, ‘how to make noodles’ (just in case you’re feeling a Sichuan noodle making project… any sort of alkaline noodle should work ok though). Then lastly, ‘how to make a bowl of burning noodles’. Apologies if this gets confusing – I just was wracking my brain trying to figure out the best way to organize this all so that we could all stay true to the essence of this dish (a quick meal) while still staying true to the flavor.

[Video is here if you’d like a visual to follow along](https://youtu.be/A1y-OhS9z20). I go off on the history a touch again in the beginning there, so jump in at ~ the two minute mark if you want just the recipe.

## Things to prepare in advance for Burning Noodles

Ok, so there’s either three or four things that I think would be convenient to prepare in advance:

* An Yibin-style chili oil called ‘xiangyou’.

* Toasted crushed peanuts.

* Toasted crushed sesame seeds.

* Toasted yacai – pickled and fermented mustard greens.

For those then, you’ll need:

1.	*Dried Sichuan Erjingtiao chilis (二荆条) -or- Arbols, 20g; Dried Heaven Facing Chili (朝天椒) -or- Thai Birds Eye, 10g; or sub in ~1/3 cup of a good chili powder.* So traditionally the chili oil is made with a toasted chili powder – a powder made from a mix of two parts Sichuan erjingtiao chili (a chili that’s roughly as how as cayenne and is known for its vibrant red color) and one part Heaven facing chili (a… quite spicy chili that’s related to and slightly more mild than Thai bird’s eye). Arbols or cayennes are an acceptable sub for Erjingtiao (though you could perhaps add a pinch of Korean chili powder for color if its convenient), Thai bird’s eye is a very close sub for Heaven facing (though Thai bird’s eye *is* hotter, fair warning).

2.	*Sichuan caiziyou (菜籽油) -or- Indian mustard seed oil -or- Peanut oil (花生油), 60g.* So right – like all oil-heavy dishes in the Chinese southwest, Yibin xiangyou relies on a virgin rapeseed oil called Caiziyou. It’s… really really hard to come by in the West (though there’s been some sightings in NYC, and it looks like Mala Market – an online Sichuan ingredient shop – might be getting some in soon). I bring it up not to tease you, but because it’s a foundational flavor. After testing a number of different oils, I found Indian mustard seed oil to be almost indistinguishable after heating it up… close enough to be a direct sub. That said, I know Indian mustard seed oil *also* isn’t exactly a supermarket staple in the West… so barring that, just use peanut oil. Not perfect, but should still taste good.

3.	*Lard (猪油) -or- cooked peanut oil (花生油), 60g.* So after making the chili oil, we’ll be mixing in a good chunk of melted lard. That said, this *is* one of those almost-veg dishes, so if you’re cooking for vegetarians… feel free to swap in cooked peanut oil instead. Basically just heat the peanut oil up til smoke point like we do in the recipe below, **cool it down a bit** and reserve (note: add the peanut oil at, let's say... 80C give or take). Not as authentic as lard, but should still be real nice in the dish. 

4.	*Spices/seasonings for the chili oil: 25g smashed ginger (姜), one whole walnut (带壳核桃), ½ cinnamon stick (桂皮), 2 star anise (八角), 1 tsp Sichuan peppercorn (花椒).* Yep, that one whole walnut – shell and all. Lends a nice earthiness to the chili oil… a real classic in Yibin xiangyou.

5.	 *Peanuts (生花生), 5 tbsp.* We’ll be toasting these, then crushing them. If you’d like, feel free to swap for an equal amount of roasted peanuts in order to skip the toasting process.

6.	*Sesame seeds (白芝麻), 1.5 tbsp.*  We’ll also be toasting and crushing these as well.

7.	*Yacai (芽菜), ~1/2 cup.* So right. The bane of many people in the West attempting to recreate Sichuan dishes – yacai (pickled and fermented mustard greens) is a non-negotiable must here. While not all Asian supermarkets carry it, the good ones do – and [it’s always available extremely overpriced online](https://www.amazon.com/Bin-Sui-Cai-SuiMiYaCai-Vegetable/dp/B01N7T7M4X).

Note that all of these amounts’ll be enough for 4-5 bowls of noodles. Feel free to scale these up if you’d like.

*Process: Chili oil, nuts, and yacai prep:*

Let’s just start with the chili oil because it’s the most intensive. For the chili oil:

1.	*If working from dried chilis, toast for ~5 minutes over medium-low flame.* The chilis’ll be done once they’ve deepened in color and started to smell real nice. As always with toasting chilis though, it’s safer to under toast than over toast.

2.	*Snip the chilis into 2cm sections, keeping the seeds but tossing the stems.*

3.	*Pulse for ~6 minutes in a blender until the chilis are rather fine flakes. Reserve.* You’re looking for a pretty ‘powdery’ chili flake – [something like this](https://i.imgur.com/uepeCo8.png).

4.	*Heat up your 60g of caiziyou (or mustard seed oil, or peanut oil) until it begins to smoke, ~230C. Keep it at that temperature for about 1-2 minutes, then shut off the heat.* Yeah, that’s not a typo – 230C. Heating the oil like this is a must for both Sichuan caiziyou *and* Indian mustard seed oil – doing so’ll significantly reduce the pungency of the oil. Makes peanut oil taste pretty good, too.

5.	*Let the oil cool down to 200-210C, then add in the ginger, the walnut, the Sichuan peppercorn, the cinnamon, and the star anise. Cook for ~5 minutes.* Adding this stuff’ll lower the temperature – not a problem, we’re looking for this to slowly cook at around 150C. If the temperature dips too far below 150C (likely), swap the heat back on to roughly cook at that temperature. It’s fine if it’s a bit variable, but you **do** need it to be at ~150 before the next step.

6.	*Take out some of the clunkier spices, then strain the oil into the chili flakes.* It’ll sizzle in a real satisfying way. Quick stir.

7.	*Melt the lard, then pour it in with the chili oil.* Another quick stir.

And… there you have it. Reserve that stuff, it’s good to use for the burning noodles.

As for everything else?

1.	*Toasted the peanuts over a medium flame for ~12 minutes.* Toast until the peanuts are cooked through and charred on the outside.

2.	*Rub the peanuts with your fingers, then lightly blow off the peels.* Or peel however you feels like, but blowing the peels off is a lot easier than going one by one.

3.	*Put the toasted peanuts in a bag, and light roll over them with a rolling pin or a 24oz beer bottle for ~2 minutes.* A beer bottle is super classic for this lol. Regardless, you want something [about this consistency](https://i.imgur.com/4UVdtSW.png). (Sorry for the blurry pic there)

4.	*Toast the sesame seeds over a medium-low flame for about five minutes.* Or until the sesame seeds start to darken and/or you can hear a couple popping.

5.	*In a mortar -or- with a bag/beer bottle, ever so lightly crush the sesame to get them to release their oil.* Some that [looks about like this](https://i.imgur.com/DghOB5W.png). 

6.	*Soak the yacai in cool water for ~5 minutes.* Doing this will get out their salinity.

7.	*Toast the yacai over a medium-low flame for 1-2 minutes.* Or until dry and just barely beginning to stick to the wok.

Note that we actually didn’t toast our yacai because we… prefer it untoasted. It’s a little sharper and funkier that way. The more proper way is to toast though, so… do that.

## How to Make Sichuan-style Alkaline Noodles

Ok, so again. This is not a must or anything. Want to sub in Japanese ramen noodles? Sure, go for it. But really… any noodle that has a nice bite to it should work fine. Want to use dried spaghetti? I mean… it wouldn’t be the same for sure, but it could still be tasty. Just be sure to cook al dente, and never tell a soul I said it was ok. 

But I do think it’s nice to undertake a noodle project every now and then – if only to help understand what you’re going for, and to guide more informed shopping choices in the future.

It’s also pretty easy in the grand scheme of things. And we’ll be using a pasta maker and a stand mixer to make our life even easier.

*Ingredients, Sichuan-style alkaline noodles:*

1.	*Bread flour -or- Chinese noodle flour (高筋面粉), 300g.* Basically anything with a higher gluten content – we were working with something that was 12.8% protein IIRC.

2.	*Water, 125g.* Or I guess 126 to be exact – we were going with 42% hydration. Note that this’ll make for a really dry dough… and some recipes go even drier than that (we actually saw one that was 38% hydration). 

3.	*Sodium carbonate (碱面), ½ tsp.* So yeah – that’s sodium carbonate, *not* sodium bicarbonate (i.e. baking soda). It’s a much stronger base… sporting a pH of ~11.5 to baking soda’s ~8.5. It’s readily available online, and feel free to sub in Jianshui/Kan Sui/Lye water if that’s more convenient. All of the above inconvenient? Feel free to use the baked baking soda trick – I’ll detail how in the notes below.

*Process, Sichuan style alkaline noodles:*

1.	*Dissolve the sodium carbonate in with the water.* Mix well.

2.	*Slowly add the water/sodium carbonate mixture into the flour, mixing it in bit by bit.* Especially because this’s a pretty dry dough, so doing it bit by bit helps the flour absorb the water more evenly. Aim for the dry parts when tossing in the water. I like mixing in with a single chopstick – less sticky that way.

3.	*Knead for ~8 minutes -or- use a stand mixer with the hook attachment on speed two.* Same ~8 minutes. Especially with the hook attachment, you might find the dough to still be a bit crumbly after eight minutes – no problem at all, just press and knead it together by hand until it all comes together. It’ll still be a bit craggly – no worries. 

4.	*Cover, let it rest for ~30 minutes.*

5.	*Cut the dough in half, then roll it into something that looks vaguely ‘sheet-ish’.* We’ll be working this one half at a time. Rolling it’s just to get it to squeeze into the pasta maker easier.

6.	*Flour the dough and pasta maker, then pass it through at the largest setting. Then do the same at the third smallest setting.*

7.	*Fold the dough ~four times, then slice it with a knife to make noodles.* So two choices here – machine cut or knife cut noodles. If you want your pasta maker to cut them, just uh… cut them. We’re looking for noodles that’re about 2mm wide. You can also cut them by hand too, of course – there’s something about the texture of knife cut noodles that I seem to prefer, but it’s hard to pinpoint what exactly. Either way, you want something that looks [more or less like this](https://i.imgur.com/ktSUbSr.png).

8.	*Pull apart and thoroughly flour the noodles.* Add more flour than you think you might need when flouring them – nothing’s worse than making a bunch of noodles, only to have them end up as one sticky mass.


In an ideal world, eat… soon. But I’ve found these are still quite good even 48-72 hours later too.

## Putting together our Burning Noodles

So in Yibin, in most of the noodle shops you have one of two choices: 100g of noodles (二两) or 150g of noodles (三两). We’ll be assuming a 150g bowl of noodles, mostly just because it feels a bit more substantive to me personally.

*Ingredients, one bowl of burning noodles:*

1.	*Fresh noodles, 150g.*

2.	*Yibin chili oil, 2 tbsp.* I.e. the chili oil from above.

3.	*Light soy sauce (生抽), 1 tsp.*

4.	*Toasted sesame oil, 1 tsp.* Actually most authentic here would be untoasted sesame oil (referred to as ‘white’ sesame oil – 白芝麻油). We used toasted out of laziness in sourcing mostly, but both work great.

5.	*Toasted -or- untoasted yacai (芽菜), 2 tbsp.* So yeah, we actually preferred ours untoasted here. But toasted yacai is more proper, so let that be your default choice.

6.	*Mixed toasted crushed peanuts/sesame, 2 tbsp.*

7.	*Sliced scallion greens (葱), ~2 tbsp.*

8.	*MSG (味精), ¼ tsp -or- chicken bouillon powder (鸡粉), ½ tsp.* Either way – chicken bouillon powder’s basically MSG (well actually usually a mix of disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate given how hyperbolic some Westerns are of MSG) plus some other stuff anyhow. You find see both in Yibin.  

*Process, Burning Noodles:*

Ok, quick aside on equipment. One super classic thing that you’ll see in Yibin are [these things](https://i.imgur.com/tfaiuKs.png) – basically, vendors’ll toss the noodles in after cooking and vigorously strain them in a snapping circular motion. You certainly don’t need to be that obsessive – just do a bang up job straining them. That said, if something conical like a chinois is handy, why not? Just toss the noodles in and snap strain like the vendors do. Plus, you feel all cool doing it.

You don’t want too much time in between straining and doing the initial mix with the liquid ingredients (like, ~60 seconds max), so be sure to have everything handy.

1.	*Cook the noodles until -just- past al dente, ~1 minute.* I usually just time this kind of thing by trying it and seeing what the texture’s like… it ended up being ~1 minute for the fresh alkaline noodles we made above. But don’t take my word for it – if you’re working with a package, go with the package… and even if you’re using the same fresh noodle recipe above, it’s possible that you couldn’t cut your noodles a little thinner or a little thicker. So yeah. Taste the noodles.

2.	*Thoroughly strain the noodes.* It’s really tough to describe this motion… basically you barely lift the strainer up above your shoulder, then snap it down to your waist. Do this 4-5 times and the noodles should be pretty dry. Or alternatively, strain however the hell you feel like – just make sure to move fast so they’re not clumping/sticking on you. 

3.	*Add the liquid ingredients: the chili oil, the soy sauce, the sesame oil.* Give it a thorough mix.

4.	*Top with the rest of the ingredients, then serve.* Mix it all up right before eating.

**Note on how to make sodium carbonate:**

So, why do we even use baking soda in baked goods and such? Well, for two reasons. First is that you can combine it with an acid like cream of tartar and make things puff up in the same way your elementary science fair volcano puffed up. 

Reason two? To make it decompose.

See, at temperatures above 80C, baking soda decomposes and forms (1) water vapor (well, water vapor over 100C of course…) (2) carbon dioxide and (3) sodium carbonate. That CO2 is what the gluten network in your pancakes traps, and what makes them light and airy. But you can take advantage of the same reaction to get your hands on some sodium carbonate, even if it’s not sold at your local supermarket.

Hat tip to Alex the French Guy cooking for this bit, his channel’s where I first heard of this. Just spread some baking soda out on a tray and bake it in a pre-heated oven at 150C for one hour. After that, jar it up and… there’s some sodium carbonate for you. Use it for this recipe, and basically anytime a recipe writer is telling you to use baking soda in order to raise pH (e.g. in Chinese velveting/marinades, the onion browning trick, de-sliming shrimp, etc etc). Sodium carbonate’ll be much stronger, so you’ll need a much smaller quantity, and it won’t alter the final taste of the dish like baking soda sometimes has the tendency to do."
Cooking,"After Pepperplate, in the last few days, decided to charge $3/month with no visible improvements I came here looking for a replacement.

Going through older posts I came across  u/julianpoy 's own recipe wonder called  [https://recipesage.com](https://recipesage.com/) and I gotta tell you, so far it is a great site/app.

Works well on desktop (Windows).  

Just downloaded the app (is it an app?) on Android and it works well also.

The transfer of my recipes from Pepperplate worked fine.  It took a few minutes (127 recipes).   

The *Scale Recipe* feature is great.  Same with the *select multiple recipes at once* feature (Put it to the test as for some reason it imported my recipes twice, possibly something I did, but it was easy to delete the doubles with this feature).

Made a change to a recipe in the phone app and the desktop version showed the updated recipe when I logged in.  

There is no fuss or ads.  It is simple and really, what else do you need?

I am excited to see how well this works for me on the next few weeks/months of using it, but my first impression is a 5/5.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you, u/julianpoy."
Cooking,"[Here's the finished product!](https://imgur.com/KW8nMPF) I made the pasta from scratch with my new pasta roller. It was a lot of fun!

[This is the recipe I used.](https://www.prouditaliancook.com/2019/11/four-cheese-ravioli-with-herb-embedded-pasta.html?m) I pretty much followed the recipe for everything, except I added the zest of one meyer lemon, which helped cut through the richness of all the cheese. 

This recipe didn't include a topping, but I went with a classic and simple [brown butter.](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/how-to-brown-butter/) 

For the topping, I toasted up some pine nuts and gave them a rough chop. I had plenty of parsley and sage left over from the dough, so I minced those very finely. I sprinkled both on top, then added some more lemon zest and parmesan.  

This came out so, so good! For me, it was worth the effort. Once I made the dough, everything else was pretty quick to come together. 

If you have a pasta roller and some patience, I recommend giving this recipe a go!

Cooking,"I love oysters.  I order them often at restaurants but rarely eat them at home.  When I do eat them at home, I clean them under cold water, then I soak them. 

 I usually soak them in a gallon of filtered water and 1/3 a cup salt and some ice.  I let them sit it in it for about 20 minutes, pour out the water, wash them off and soak them again in the same water/salt solution.  I’ve been told this gets them tasting fresher and also helps remove any sand that may be in these guys.  


I recently had some at a friends house.  I told them about my soak method and he said he’s been just rinsing and eating for years.

This sauce really...REALLY does not work with this recipe. Maybe it’s just me. But it’s tangy and citrusy and it just does not taste good with meat and leeks. I already poured it all over the pot of gnocchi. (I tasted it by itself before adding it and thought it was good!) Any suggestions on what I could add to make it less...tangy, I guess?

Soon I will be making a red wine reduction jus that I've made before and have  a question about the prior meat (steak) preparation. 

Noticeably the meat itself comes secondary to the Au jus in flavour. While this is completely okay as it is still delicious, I've been wondering if there were any complimenting pre-marinades I could pair with the flavour profile of the Au jus. 

It's not crucial of course but if anyone has any tips or personal experiences that they have paired to perfection I would love to know.

To note the main flavour profiles of the reduction are:

1. Red wine
2. Shallots
3. Balsamic

Thank you everyone for your time, can't wait to see if there are any delicious recipes you have in mind.

&gt; * 2 cans condensed cheddar cheese soup
&gt; * 2 cans mushrooms, stems and pieces
&gt; 
&gt; *Directions*  
&gt; Heat the butter in a large, heavy-bottom pot. Add the flour and stir to make a blond roux. Add vegetables and cook until wilted. Add artichokes and mushrooms. Cook for about 15 minutes. Add all soups and heat through. Do not allow to come to a boil. If the mixture is too thick, add cream or half and half, a little at a time. Do not add milk, as it will curdle. Add oysters and their liquor. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve.  

FWIW, the beginning steps - making a roux and cooking the trinity (onions, celery, peppers) - are classic starting steps for many Creole dishes. I think the issue comes in with the canned soups. I have tried making my own mushroom, celery and cheese soups as starters for this one, but the final result comes out one of two ways 1) tastes OK, but is too watery or 2) too strongly flavored of either mushroom or celery but consistency is right."

Cooking,"I'm sitting here eating a really really good bowl of ramen.  It's so good.  And it reminds me of a conversation I had with a friend of mine some time ago where we both agreed that learning how to cook has been one of the greatest benefits in our respective lives.  Being able to put ingredients together and turn out something that you like, and maybe even other people like, is simply *joy.*  Not being limited to what restaurants you can find is *freedom* and I am so so grateful for having learned this skill.

If I could thank people, I'd have to thank just a whole host of chefs who have had cooking shows that I have devoured relentlessly for decades.  The first cooking show I ever remember watching as a kid was [The Frugal Gourmet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfigPIvycCc) (Jeff Smith) on PBS.  After that Food Network took off and I definitely ate up Emeril, Alton Brown, Mario Batali and others.  On the internet I continue to follow Chef John at Food Wishes,  Adam Ragusea, Alex at French Guy Cooking and all the wonderful folks over at the Bon Apetit Test Kitchen.  Without all of these inspirations in my life, I'd still be eating macaroni and cheese out of a box probably.

Anyway, if you're unsure, just starting out, have no idea what you're doing or are afraid of 'screwing up' in the kitchen, I have to say: just do it.  Just keep cooking, screw things up, learn from your mistakes.  It's so rewarding in the end, I promise.

As for my ramen, this is what I do to make it fantastic:

1) Throw away that stupid packet of 'flavor' they put in there.  It's worthless.  Get yourself some Better Than Bullion in whatever flavor you like (there are several).  It's infinitely superior.

2)  Sear off some chicken breasts and finish them in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes or so.

3) stir fry some veggies and just put them in a bowl to wait for now.  I use carrots, broccoli and onions.

4) On top of those veggies in that bowl, put the following: soy sauce (amount to taste), sriracha (ditto), fresh garlic, and freshly grated ginger.  All of this can sit for a few minutes marinating it's fine.

5) Use the pasta water to dissolve the bullion and just dump all of that over your noodles and veggies.  The broth will form instantly and take on a deep, rich color and you'll be able to smell that ginger throughout the house.  It's wonderful.

6) Top with chicken breasts, cut on the bias.  Finish with some cilantro or scallion or even a couple soft boiled eggs if you want.

Obviously this isn't a complicated recipe or particularly inventive, but it's just great and something I would never have dreamed of doing before I really got into cooking.

I went hunting with a buddy this weekend and shot a snow goose, and decided to just throw a brunch skillet together. It came out WAY better than I expected and I wanted to share with y'all. Detailed recipe below, but first, Imgur link to the finished tastiness:

https://imgur.com/gallery/QP1bq0k

Okay so recipe-ish. I don't cook with specific measurements all the time, I just kind of feel it out most of the time.

1) The night before your brunch, clean your goose breast fillets (I just used one for this one shared meal). Combine goose breasts in a plastic bag with 1/3 measure each of: Sriracha, Worcestershire sauce, and Sweet Chili Sauce (I used Frank's Kickin' Garlic Sauce in a substitution), where the marinade mixture just covers the goose in the bag. Cool and let it marinate over night (you don't have to do it overnight, just give it an hour or more if you're in a hurry).

2) Half-ish of a bag of frozen breakfast hasbrowns (the shredded kind). I cooked those in the vegetable oil the bag suggested, and added some pepper and garlic seasoning after they'd cooked a bit and I was stirring for the first time. Finish them and set them to the side.

3) Heat a cast iron skillet with a small amount (maybe 2TBSP tops) of Grapeseed Oil on high, until just before your oil smokes. Sear your goose breast to preference. I like my wild game cooked to rare/medium rare if it's able to be safely consumed that way, so I really just did 2.5 minutes on each side, and left it in the hot skillet while I tidied my workspace a bit. I discarded the used marinade, but if you wanted you could heat it up on the stove to a boil and reduce it to make a nice spicy glaze during this time.

4) Remove your goose breast from the skillet, put it on a cutting board to rest. Add the hash brown potatoes to the cast iron and use a spoon or spatula to stir them in the leftover stuck on stuff, oil, and juices from your searing.

5) In a separate pan, put about 2TBSP of butter to melt on medium, then fry two eggs over easy, adding a small amount of pepper and garlic powder, to taste.

6) Slice your goose to preferred thickness, lay it on the potatoes, add your eggs, and drizzle either your glaze you chose to make or sprinkle Cholula on top.

It came out way better than expected, and my buddy actually commented that ""I would never be disappointed if a fancy brunch place brought this meal to me."" 

I love wild game and this recipe actually offered very little of the game-y taste I expected, probably because of the overnight marinade. If you have any tips to offer to make it better or enhance this meal, please let me know! Thanks!

Cooking,"Everyone seems to do it differently. The instructions on my packets say 24-42 hours, some people say 24 hours, some people say a few hours is fine...

My mom only soaks bacalao for maybe 2 to 4 hours. She just rinses it thoroughly several times. I made some for myself and soaked it maybe 1 hour, but it came out fine since I changed out the water more than on once. There was only a mild saltiness; for the most part it tasted plain."

I used Samin Nosrat's recipe from Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat. In the book, as in the Netflix series, she goes on and on about the soffritto. But I didn't understand how much flavor could actually come from sauteed celery and carrots. Onions sure, but celery and carrots?

Not to mention the wine, the bay leaves, the lemon and orange zest, cinnamon stick, nutmeg and tomato paste.

And this thing simmered for about 3 hours. The result is a meat sauce that was filling, complex, and made the apartment smell amazing. 10/10 will make again.

Cooking,"They are so freaking good. Super easy to whip up, and a great side dish or light main entree. Can be made GF (with GF breadcrumbs) or kosher for Passover (use matzah meal). If I chop the spinach small enough, I can get the kiddo to eat them without complaint. 

The only changes I would make is to hold off on the eggs until you've added the salt/pepper, so that you can add enough to taste, and that it's easier to scoop them out with a spoon, roll into a ball, gently pat down flat, and *then* put them in the pan. It's much harder to flatten them once they are in the pan. Make 1 test fritter to taste for seasoning, too. 

 [https://aggieskitchen.com/ricotta-and-spinach-fritters/](https://aggieskitchen.com/ricotta-and-spinach-fritters/) 

 

2 cups ricotta 

3 eggs, lightly whisked

3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

1 cup Panko

2 cups fresh spinach, sliced thin

a couple of good pinches of salt and pepper

6-8 tablespoons olive oil, divided, for frying (use more or less based on your preference)

 

1. Add ricotta, eggs, Parmesan cheese, panko, salt and pepper to a large bowl. Stir gently until just combined. Fold spinach into mixture.
2. Drizzle about a tablespoon or two of olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat and spread around. Scoop a heaping tablespoon of ricotta and spinach mixture into hot oil and gently push down with spoon to spread and flatten just a bit, this helps them all cook up evenly. Repeat with as many spoonfuls as fit in your pan (I made 5 - 6 per batch).
3. Cook for about 2 minutes on first side until golden brown. Flip and continue to cook another 2 minutes until other side browns as well. Serve warm, room temperature or cold out of the refrigerator as a snack."

So my plan was to sauté mushrooms and fish, then make a pan sauce with white wine but I'm not sure the best approach here, or for future dishes. I can think of three ways of going about it and would like some help with what I should do and when.

Fistly I could sautee the mushroom, and fish in the same pan then deglaze it with the wine for the sauce.

I could do it in seperate pans, then de glaze each and add the two sauces together to make one or keep it seperate and have two sauces

Or I could just deglaze one pan for the sauce and ignore the other.

I leaning towards doing everything in one pan, seems like it'd be the easiest but I'm also thinking what would be best for the future when I need to use two pans and want to make the sauce."

Cooking,"This is something that is used constantly in professional kitchens but I never really see used in home kitchens (at least in the West). It is incredibly easy to make and store, and will absolutely transform your sauteeing/high heat cooking. 


To make it, simply add butter to a sauce pan- the size depends on how much clarified butter you want to make. I wouldn't do anything less than a pound, but I recommend you do a couple pounds - it lasts longer than whole butter because of the lack of milk solids so it won't go bad. Melt the butter down, and using a spoon, ladle off the white solids. You could either pour the butter through a fine mesh sieve with some cheese cloth to separate the butter from the solids at the bottom, or you can just ladle the butter out carefully (I recommend doing this).


To take it a step further and make ghee, simply cook the butter longer until the milk solids start to brown and the butter smells slightly nutty, and then strain.


The biggest advantage to using clarified butter is it's smoke point. It has a smoke point of around 450F (232C), which is around the same as corn and peanut oil, is higher than canola oil (400F, 205C), and much higher than extra virgin olive oil (330F, 166C) and whole butter (350F, 176C) This means you can get your pan hotter, allowing you to get harder sears on your food.


Another advantage, obviously, is flavor. I'm sure I dont need to tell you that butter tastes amazing, and is much preferable to vegetable/canola oil. You can use it exactly how you would use any other cooking oil, but some suggestions:


-Sauteeing veggies


-Eggs - great for getting a crispy over easy egg


-Use it for searing meats


-Poach shrimp in it


-Making hollandaise. If anyone is interested in an awesome hollandaise recipe, just let me know. It's the one I was taught at my culinary school and developed by the CIA. This post is long enough as it is, though, so I don't want to make it any longer.

So I kinda eye-balled the egg-to-milk ratio for the batter, are there ratio's or rules? I used a mix of corn-starch and potato starch, also eyeballing the ratio. Are there any real differences in using the two? I also see a lot of people double starching; starching directly to the dried chicken breast, egg coating, again starching. Is this suitable for oven purposes?  
I used a oven sheet and lined it with non-stick baking paper and coated it with advocado oil (was the only thing available at the moment). I don't quite understand the need to drizzle it on top of the chicken as well, would that not prevent from crisping?

Cooking,"I'm interested in buying a proper kitchen knife set. I haven't been a dedicated chef to date, but with a little one on the way, I'll be cooking at home a lot more. I'm looking at two sets:

1. Henckels International 15 piece set--great brand, but seems to be of lower quality (made in China). Retails for ca. $100.
2. Henckels Zwilling 14 piece set--same great brand; steel seems to be of higher quality (made in Germany). Retails for ca. $250.

Is the Zwilling line worth the price increase? Would I notice the difference between the two? Also open to other brand recommendations. Thank you!

Edit: Thanks everyone! You’ve convinced me to not buy a set and to look instead for individual knives I’ll actually use."

What are the similarities and differences between both the sauce (apart from their obvious main ingredients) ? Are they truly interchangeable? I need a good vegetarian alternative to Oyster Sauce and was wondering if Mushroom Sauce is perfect for that?

Cooking,"Hi all,

My girlfriend and I will be hosting a dinner party for 5-6 of our friends. I'm trying to create a bit of a ""fancy"" dinner without having a huge amount of culinary experience.

So far I have thought of two appetisers. Dessert will be done by girlfriend, but definitely taking recommendations.

First course:

Spanish seafood stew with squid, hake, mussels and shrimp in a tomato/onion/garlic sauce

Second course:

Homemade spicy tuna/cayenne pâtè served with dijon mustard flavoured crostini and heavy cream based sauce

Main couse:

Looking for recommendations. Should follow the fish/seafood theme for the dinner. I'd try and avoid any pasta or similar stuff, since this is a staple of my everyday meals. 

I was thinking maybe fishcakes would be good?"
Cooking,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

This question is kinda of embarassing, but here it goes.

As for the context, I am 19 year old and decided that it'd really be time to pick up cooking, but I'm not really sure on where to start.

I still live at my mom's house as I'm still in school, and there's no real benefit of me moving out since it's fairly close to where my mom lives, and because of this reason I've pretty much relied on my mom's cooking until now. 

For school, I'll have to do an intern for \~4 months straight, which will be in a foreign country. This will start in late august, however, I have never really cooked apart from some eggs and simple pasta. I talked about it with my mom and she said that I could start cooking a bit for myself, and that she'd be there while I cooked to help me out and what not, but I had to come up with a list of dishes I'd like to be able to cook and whatnot.

The intern will be in Hungary, and I currently live in the Netherlands, if this matters for some reason regarding the recommendations.

&amp;#x200B;

The question here would be; Do you guys have any dishes you'd recommend starting with, and possibly even some receipts I could follow which aren't too hard to start out with?"
Cooking,"Like the title says, have a package of raw chicken that's been in the fridge since Monday, 1/13. I've heard 1-2 days but the chicken smelled fine, didn't feel slimy, and the sell by date is tomorrow.

I've seen chicken with much shorter sell-by dates at the store before so I'm sort of assuming some chicken is kept in storage by stores for awhile before being sold? And I'm assuming they don't follow the 1-2 days rule, either. Would y'all use or toss?

Cooking,"Hi, maybe someone knows about this, its hard to explain, there i go:

When i make my own version of kung pao chicken, I cut chicken breasts and make a marinade with soy sauce, mirim (or another acidic solution), and spices, garlic ginger and so on, nothing special, is in almost every Asian recipe and the target is to add flavor to the chicken.

After I cook it, another thing happens, it's like magic, the texture changes, and this new texture is an absolute miracle. I don't know how to describe, its more gummy, smooth, cant sense the fibers in the meat.

And my doubt always is why? why does this happens? is the soy sauce? the chilling? the rehidratation of the meat? the acidic ingredients on the marinade? or the sudden change of temperature when I throw it on the flaming hot wok?

And then, a couple days ago, I saw a video where i learned a technique called **brine** first time i ear about it (its not popular here in Argentina) they drown the chicken in salty water overnight, apparently by osmosis an interchange of fluids happens and the chicken gets more salty and less dry when you cook it on the even, french technique i guess.

I am thinking now that this is what happens with the soy marinade every time! am i right?

Maybe I could even make red meat smoother without changing the flavor!.

What do you think?..."

Cooking,"I love roasting vegetables, of course, especially in the winter to help warm the house.  However, I do indulge in something that seems kind of selfish. 

When I first take the roasted veg out of the oven, I immediately dig in. Specifically I am searching for the smallest bits and bites, super browned or at times black.  This includes the broken off layers of the main parts.  Yams, potatoes, squash, cauliflower, asparagus, brussell sprouts, onions, peppers of all sorts, a mix of italian veg.  Doesn't matter what it is.

Temperature is not a factor.

Cooking,"So recently my girlfriend and I started taling care of our diet. We basically ate junkfood and sugery drinks and all the bad stuff all the time. We made a serious change and we follow a healthy balanced diet. We both lost weight already in the first two weeks which is nice! The problem however is the food we eat for dinner. Now to have a balanced meal we have 200 grams of vegetables, a small portion of carbs(rice, pasta, potatoes etc.) And a portion of protein. However so far the food we make is kinda boring and doesn't taste great. For instance we made salmon last night with potatoes and broccoli. Salmon was nice potato and brocolli were not that much. We avoid using most sauces btw. We both love food a lot and I was wondering if you guys had some tips or recipe ideas to make it easier for us to stick to this balanced diet."

But that aside, when I use their ""Find My Field"" tool, it seems the tomatoes legitimately come from farms in the Mt. Vesuvius region of Italy (assuming the tool isn't rigged).

Why doesn't Cento seek true D.O.P. certification for their San Marzano tomatoes? Could it be their way to keeping costs down? Or are they unable to get certification (I noticed the fields are often adjacent to a populated road or highway so maybe air quality plays into it)?

FWIW, I recall reading somewhere that actual D.O.P. tomatoes exported to U.S. supermarkets are all Grade C, and that the ""good"" crops are kept by the Italians and/or are only accessible to purchase by restaurants.

**My own opinion:** I often find Cento tomatoes to be a bit ""brighter"" in taste than actual D.O.P. tomatoes from brands like Sclafani or La Fede. I'd say a non-discerning, non-picky eater wouldn't really be able to tell the difference. Whereas you can absolutely tell the difference between Cento/Sclafani D.O.P./La Fede D.O.P. vs. domestic tomatoes distributed by Muir Glen, Jersey Fresh, Bianco diNapoli, etc."

I know, I know, doesn’t sound like much, but for the last 18 months or so, as I’ve made stuff, I’ve looked at the recipe and thought it could be improved, but I’ve been nervous about going off-book.

Cooking,"I’m trying my best to replicate my grandmother’s roast recipe, and I don’t know much about it, but I’ve never been able to really get it.

All I can say for sure is that she seared it before hand (no big surprise there) and she put garlic cloves into the meat.

But when it was done it was super, fall-apart tender, and absolutely infused with garlic flavor in every bite.

The only time I’ve personally tasted anything like it is, very randomly to me, at the Iraqi-Jewish restaurant Azura in Jerusalem’s main market, where they serve a “beef sofrito” that is cubes of beef instead of a whole roast.  And damn if it doesn’t taste just like my grandmother’s.

In any event, does anyone have any idea for how to achieve the garlic-in-every-bite, fall-apart roast?  I don’t even know what cut of beef.  And every time I try, even absolutely bombarding the thing with garlic cloves, I get barely any garlic flavor."

Cooking,"I have a friend who does it all the time and I decided to give it a shot last night. I couldn't tell you the last time I roasted a whole bird, as I've always felt like it didn't turn out well, like I always overcooked it. But spatchcocking is a game changer. This was literally the best roast chicken I've ever done, and the breast meat was so incredibly moist. Holy crap! And it was so easy!

Preheat oven to 425, line a sheet pan with parchment.

Halve small golden potatoes, slice onions and carrots (I didn't have carrots last night but will the next time), toss with a little olive oil  and salt and pepper and add to sheet pan in a single layer.  You could also add garlic and fresh herbs to the veg.

Flip the bird over and, using kitchen shears, cut along both sides of the spine to remove it.  Then, using a sharp knife, score the breast bone.  Place bird breast side up on top of the veg and press down on the breast bone until it breaks to flatten everything out. 

Brush skin with olive oil and season with salt and pepper and put in the middle rack of the oven. Cook for 45 minute and then check doneness with an instant read thermometer in the breast/thigh, sticking it back in for a few minutes if it's not 165. 

This was so easy and so good.

I tried scrubbing with an OXO pad as well as wiping with magic eraser.  Is there a magic trick I'm missing for maintaining these pans? I'd like them to look clean for as long as possible!"
Cooking,"I forgot to buy a lemon for my recipe ): I literally just came back from the store and I bought all my other ingredients for my hollandaise sauce...

Cooking,"So I am not no-carb, but I look for ways to lower my carb intake because I don't like my doctor chiding me about how I am going to lose my feet. I recently discovered the korean radish at our local international grocery store, and decided to make lower-carb home fries with them as a potato replacement. They are pretty tasty, and while they don't kill your starch cravings (kinda the point), they make good home fries. I have not tried mashing them (I use parsnips for that, though they are only a bit lower-carb), but I have included them in some slow-cooked stews and whatnot to replace potato. I am considering using potato peels in stews and chowders to give the earthy potato flavor without all the starch, but then I would have a bunch of potatoes without clothes on, and no use for them.

Anybody got any ideas? It staggers me to think of how many potato peels get thrown out every day when it has all that flavor attached. Any other ideas for what to do with these enormous radishes?"

Cooking,"I work in a professional kitchen, and I have since fell in love using the gas cooktop. However, I will be moving into a rental home with an electric stovetop and I just can’t get behind it anymore. Is it worth it to invest in a propane/butane portable cooktop?

Any advice or recommendations if it is worth it?

I cook at home roughly 3-4 nights, and cook breakfast most every day for context in amount of use.

ETA: Would an induction cooktop be better value? How well can you control heat with one, for those who have them?"
Cooking,"So, i received a grinder for Christmas... I went to Costco. Bought some roast, and didn't realize the chuck roast costs more than the ground stuff... It's a lot of clean up to grind your own meat, why does it cost more to grind your own vs buy it preground?

Note. i don't like Costco hamburger, so i likely won't be buying it there again, other stores all want like $5 a pound for chuck roast...  so disappointing, hell brisket is cheaper here than chuck."

Cooking,I'm moving soon to a new apartment that will come with an induction range. It seems like I'll have to get some new stuff as not all of my current cookware will work. I was looking at Made In. There was a pretty [disastrous review in Wired](https://www.wired.com/review/review-made-in-cookware/) a couple years ago. It seems like from further research they've made some adjustments and everything is all good now? Anyone have any first hand experience with this brand? Any other recommendations for good induction cookware?
Cooking,"When you're making rice on the stovetop, how often does your rice come out perfect? My rice doesnt come out perfect consistently. Sometimes it comes out mushy and overcookeded. I'm using a 1:2 ratio. Does anybody run I to this problem with cooking rice?"
Cooking,"I'm having to remodel my kitchen due to a slab water leak. Insurance has ripped the whole kitchen out and now I have the opportunity to reimagine it the way I want. The only problem is we don't have 220 volt electric. We have two gas lines as our former appliances where a gas cooktop and a small 24 inch gas oven. We hated the 24-inch one and referred to it as the Easy-Bake oven because it couldn't even fit a cookie sheet. The electrical panel is opposite side of the house from the kitchen and is completely full. It's pretty old so we would probably need to update it in order to add a new 220 volt dedicated circuit. It would be very expensive to run the lines through the whole house to the kitchen as we don't have an attic since we have second floor. I've been kind of toying with the idea of getting a refurbished 48 in professional grade gas range and oven like a thermador, wolf or Viking. Usually these 48 in dual ovens. 1 roughly 27 in and the other much smaller. 

Or should I pay the expense and run 220?

 I cook 95% of our meals for 4 adults and 2 kids. I also a few times a month cook for 12+ people. I do have a pellet smoker (essentially a convection oven), large grill bbq, sous vide, pressure cooker, air fryer ect. So I have other ways to prepare food. 

I guess the other option is to just get a 30 or 36"" slide in gas oven and range and make do with a single oven."

Cooking,"I'm using a Phillips Air Fryer for cooking Tandoori Chicken. Has anyone else tried it and come out successfully?

All these YouTube videos make it out to be a wonder device. However, I tried it and the chicken remained **absolutely raw from the bottom.** 

**Overcooked from the top.** And will you believe it? Besides the chicken getting overcooked from the top, the **marinade was squishy wet everywhere**. When I tried to cut the chicken from the top portion all the marinade came out into my hand.

I also tried cooking french fries by coating the potato in a few drops of oil and it **tastes absolutely nothing like the french fries** from the market. Yes I did that basting shit where we boil potatoes at 60 degrees of water to remove starch and also tried deep freezing the pieces before cooking them. In all cases it made the shittiest french fries I've ever eaten.

I tried making **cutlets** and they too came out shitty. 

It feels like the Air Fryer isn't actually frying the food in any way. It just throws hot air and seems to do a worse job than an ordinary oven. In an oven at least the chicken marinade dries up after a while.

**Has anyone else tried Air Fryers? Have you tried cooking chicken in it? How were the results?** 

**Note:** I've tried cooking at **170, 180, 190, 200**. I never cook more than 10-15 mins at a stretch. Do the ""take it out and jiggle"" shit."
Cooking,"Recently I tried one of the food box delivery services, but the amount of waste that it entailed, makes me extremely hesitant to try it again.   Does anyone know if there is a recipe website where you can choose 3-4 recipes for the week and it creates a shopping list that sends the order to Kroger/Walmart/Instacart/Amazon or something similar?  It seems like that might be a better happy medium."
Cooking,"So I had a dish [similar to this](https://tasteofmaroc.com/moroccan-couscous-with-seven-vegetables/) at a Moroccan restaurant (it was vegetarian) and it was absolutely delicious. While I'm not vegetarian persay, I'm trying to get more plants in my diet and limiting my meat consumption to when I eat out. This dish is just so colorful and packed with veggies, it's absolutely awesome.

I'm also pretty new to cooking (I'm aware that this is a little ambitious for a novice cook, but I figure I'll learn either way), and I'm also trying to up my protein intake because I'm trying to build muscle (at 6'3 and 180 lbs, I need a lot). Bodybuilding and tasty, hearty meals aren't usually synonymous (I don't want to eat chicken and steamed broccoli for the rest of my life lol)

So while the recipe does offer a vegetarian version, I want to up the protein. So I was thinking about maybe using tofu (since it basically takes on the flavor of whatever it's cooked in) or maybe seitan. But I'm not sure how that would go, I probably can't cook the tofu the same way she cooks the meat or it'd probably fall apart, correct?

Thanks"

It is without a doubt the best olive oil I've ever had, such an intense aroma. What recipes can I try to make where the oil would be the star of the dish? Thinking something along the lines of a Caprese salad. I've only used it so far to dip bread in with some balsamic"
Cooking,"Straight to the important part, pictures: http://imgur.com/a/KKYRVgA

I have wanted to put Beyond ground ""beef"" to the test with Bolognese sauce for a long time, and yesterday I decided to do it. On the blog/recipe sphere, I see a lot of vegetarian and vegan adaptations of Bolognese and the vast majority tend to go off the rails with unnecessary ingredients (well, less unnecessary if vegan) and preparation methods. The question I wanted to answer was, ""Can a classic Bolognese recipe taste comparable when swapped with plant-based meat?""

The very short answer is yes, and I'm sure it would be fine if the *only* adjustment you made was swapping the meat. However - there are two main problems I notice when cooking with plant based ground beef: fat rendering and rich flavor. If you ever scan the back of a Beyond Beef package, the macronutrient composition is almost identical to 80/20 ground beef. Texturally, the stuff definitely holds up. 

To compensate for the fat rendering (or lack thereof) as well as rich flavor I made three adjustments to Marcella's recipe:

* One clove of garlic, very finely minced, added at the end of soffritto sweating. This decision was less about adding garlic to the overall flavor profile than intensifying the other flavors in the dish, which I find garlic does very well in small quantities.

* When sauteeing the Beyond beef, I added three tbsp of tomato paste. If you've ever eaten Beyond beef, it has a faint coconut flavor. Adding tomato early, especially paste, was an attempt to block that flavor note from overpowering the more delicate soffritto, as well as adding some of that glutamate goodness early. Also - I found the tomato paste helped make the soffritto and beef juicier as it broke down in the pot, potentially compensating for some of the loss of fat rendering.

* Speaking of glutamates, I added one medium sized parmesan rind with the 1 1/2 cup of tomatoes just before simmering. I know some new age Bolognese recipes call for fish sauce (Kenji) and other umami boosters, but I wanted to preserve Marcella's recipe as carefully as possible. That meant not just throwing in any flavor enhancer I could think of. 

I served with penne because I didn't have any tagliatelle, so you could say that alone made this a bastardized ragù ;) 

Overall - a delicious meal, served alongside a simple mâche green salad dressed with a lemon vinaigrette to cut through some of the sauce's richness. I'd recommend this plant-based adaptation for anyone looking to experiment with some classics while reducing their carbon footprint.

Cooking,"Those two ingredients add such a beautiful depth of flavor to so many dishes! I made chili a few nights ago and added a little tomato paste. My husband said it was the best chili I ever made! I made a lovely red wine reduction for beef ribs and it was delicious. I wish I started using these ingredients sooner. They are such a game changer and elevate the dishes they're used in. 

What are some of your favorite ingredients that just take a dish to the next level?"

Cooking,"Hey all, 

So I made Hollandiase sauce today for the first time! And I also ate Hollandaise sauce for the first time today!

So I am not sure if it is supposed to taste like that or not aha. My BF said that it was kind of bland tasting, but he has only ever eaten pre packaged stuff which probably was right full of sugar to make it taste better to the average person. 

Here is my ingredients:

4 egg yolks
Half a lime squeezed (didnt have a lemon, so improvised)
Chili powder( didnt have cayenne lol)
Half a cup of melted salted butter


While I did improvise some ingredients, maybe this did it for me? These caused a slightly different taste? I thought it was an alright first attempt, but ready to perfect it!"
Cooking,"Hey folks! My mother's electric skillet is dying and terrible and we want to get her a new one. We were chatting about the perfect skillet for her and wondering if it even exists. So, if you have or know of an electric skillet that fits the following list and works great, please share! Price doesn't matter for a good piece of equipment.

- Rectangular, and large enough to cook six pancakes at once (current skillet is roughly 12"" x 15"", bigger would be better)

- deep walls for large dishes

- skillet detaches from electric heating unit for easy cleaning

- even distribution of heat

The skillet detaching is the big one. We're looking on the Google too of course, but finding something so specific is hard and I'd like to hear from people who have actually used and can recommend an item.

Thank you in advance, and if this isn't the right subreddit for this, please let me know and I can repost elsewhere!"

Cooking,"Been getting into baking recently, a strange thing happened the other day when I scraped out my cake mix into the baking tin ready for the oven and went to taste the rest of the residue from off the spatula. *Really* strong chemical flavour, quite unpleasant. I mix in a glass bowl so it isn’t caused by  that, and the dough itself tastes fine, just seems to be something in the baking spatula itself. Just one of those soft edge white ones, I had it about a year and wash it in the dishwasher. It’s never been exposed to any crazy pH or anything like that so I don’t know why it has a chemically taste. 

Anyway, I’m getting a new one and want to know if there is any specific material or onevto get that is totally inert. Thanks guys"
